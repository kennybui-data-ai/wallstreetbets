[Top 15 Options Activity from Friday \(1\/29\/2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/50atl3uc1pe61.png?width=1373&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e0b4faeda15be0c6e6cf70d0dff3a1bd9d01b0a)

Due to the exponential increase in membership in WSB I have started to see a lot of misinformation, favoritism, and overall divisiveness going on within the community. I decided to do my own Due Diligence (DD) to determine which stocks I will be holding next week, and hopefully this can start up a meaningful conversation in the comment section to help out our new friends who mostly want to know what to invest in.  I pulled the top 15 stocks with the greatest Options Volume from Friday (1/29). You can see all 4 of the $BANG stocks make this list. Despite understanding that GME is a heavily shorted stock with a Short Float greater than 100%, it is important to look at the Put Volume as well. This is the numbers of option contracts that are shorting the stock. GameStop is the only company of the batch that has a Short Float of greater than 100%, which is why this short squeeze is working so well, but it’s also the most heavily shorted on the options side. I think it’s important to see all 4 of the BANG stocks are heavily shorted on the put side too. If you look up who is buying these Put Contracts, it is mostly big institutional investors, whose best interest is to artificially depress the stock price so their puts pay out (look at what happened to BB and NOK on Thursday and Friday). This is why we have to stand together as a community and embrace the $BANG index that we created.

**GME** \- This is a short squeeze. Not much to say here. Buy, hold, don’t sell.

**BB** \- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. 66% of the float (shares available) are owned by institutional investors, so while the float might seem big (550M), we are only dealing with 34% of the shares. Buy, hold, don’t sell.

**AMC** \- Also a short squeeze. The Short float isn’t above 100% but this is still a great potential candidate.

**NOK** \- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. This is the weirdest one to me because everyone was claiming this was “bot” propaganda last week and then has the 3rd highest option volume on Friday. Not sure how to feel about this one, but hey its popular.

**Defining some terms:**

**Short Float:** Percentage of shorted shares in relation to the total number of floated shares (shares available to be traded)

**Options Volume:** Total number of **option** contracts bought and sold for the day

**% Put:** Percentage of total option contracts that are puts (think the stock will go down)

**% Call:** Percentage of total option contracts that are calls (think the stock will go up)

**Put/Call Ratio:** Ratio of puts to calls option contracts (higher the ratio, higher the short %)

I had my first 6 figure day in the market on Friday when NVAX went from 134 to 235 overnight after reporting great efficacy data. My weeklies were up 9000%, it was incredible. I want to send a thank you to u/Upstairs_Speech for his posts in the past, I would not have thought of the trade if it was not for him.

Now before you all tell me ""I wish I saw this before the stock went up 70%"" let me explain to you why this is still early innings. Sure, this might not be as sexy of a trade as round 1 was, but now that data concerns are off the table this thesis has a lot less risk. This one is more of a low risk, high growth play as opposed to a get rich quick one.

Let's do a mental exercise:

The day is December 31, 2020, everyone is excited to be moving on to 2021. NVAX share price hovers at $110, a $7B market cap awaiting UK phase 3 efficacy data. There are real concerns as to whether NVAX actually has a vaccine that works given their prior 30 years of failures. The market prices this risk accordingly and NVAX's market cap is only **17%** that of MRNA.

Fast forward 4 weeks. NVAX has released data on 20,000 patients, shows the highest efficacy of any vaccine against wild type COVID. NVAX shows strong efficacy against UK strain which no one else has. They show that the South Africa strain is a real concern with efficacy at 60%, and there is 0 reason to believe any vaccine will perform better against that strain. 

And I can't overstate this part enough, the **really** important detail here is that NVAX is the only protein vaccine on the horizon. The only other protein vaccine coming any time soon is MAYBE GSK/Sanofi and they already showed terrible data. They blamed it on dosing but there are major question marks there and they are delayed 6 months minimum. The reason protein vaccines are important is because they are the only ones that can offer coverage against multiple strains in a single shot. This is how the flu shot is done (which NVAX just passed phase 3 of in March). The flu shot is a protein vaccine that covers 4 strains in a single shot. What is becoming very clear is that we are going to need the same for COVID. The future of COVID vaccines is that in your annual shot you get coverage against wild type, SA strain and Brazil strain for example. NVAX is the **only** company that can do this right now. RNA vaccines are too reactive to handle multiple strains. You can already see how many symptoms people get with the current vaccine.

This [thread](https://twitter.com/PeterKolchinsky/status/1354929042965864451?s=20) is gold and helped me to understand the situation.

The market clearly has not digested this sufficiently yet. How do I know? Let's go back to the exercise from the beginning. Given NVAX's advancements in the last 4 weeks their market cap has doubled, up to 14B. What do you think Moderna has done in that same time frame when their COVID platform continues to weaken? Up 5%? 10%? 20%? They are up 67% in that same time frame! After everything that has happened NVAX still only has **20%** the market cap of MRNA. It basically hasn't even caught up. The reporting from mainstream media on NVAX was an abomination, especially compared to how they covered J&J's bad data. The truth will emerge. The market will realize it and will see NVAX is still deeply undervalued.

I am obviously not saying that NVAX will inevitably be as valuable or more valuable than MRNA. MRNA technology is very valuable and they are an extremely ambitious company. BUT, NVAX is about to play catch up due to the glaring discrepancy. In addition to COVID don't forget that NVAX has an incredible flu shot, likely at some point to be the first RSV vaccine ever and their Matrix M adjuvant is now very valuable. Quick recap of differences between the two vaccines:

https://preview.redd.it/diljgsjmxoe61.png?width=425&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a0e94718b1185709f44d2de968aec6e566c4aa6

My belief is that NVAX gets to a 20B market cap very soon (50% upside) and I can't imagine a world in which its not at 30B minimum by year end (100% upside). Upcoming catalysts are finalizing 200M dose deal with EU, emergency use authorization in the UK and other countries will quickly follow, production partnership with Merck or GSK/Sanofi and others.

IMO this week will be very telling, if it is up on Monday buy and don't think twice. If it pulls back maybe give it a couple days to get a better price on options as it might consolidate for a while.

**Positions:**

75% allocated to 1/21/22 280 calls. If it gets to 30B market cap by expiration its over a 300% return and I think market cap gets there by end of summer so it would be even more profitable. Don't mess with the July calls at this point, they are too expensive. You basically get the same value and more time going with next January. IMO this one is free money.

25% allocated to 4/16/21 240 calls. If it gets to 20B market cap by expiration this is a 150% return. I think there is a somewhat decent chance it could be there by the end of this week but we will see."|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|['NVAX']|['NVAX']|['I', 'I', 'NVAX', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'NVAX', 'B', 'UK', 'NVAX', 'MRNA', 'NVAX', 'COVID', 'NVAX', 'UK', 'I', 'NVAX', 'MAYBE', 'NVAX', 'COVID', 'COVID', 'SA', 'NVAX', 'RNA', 'I', 'B', 'COVID', 'NVAX', 'MRNA', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'I', 'NVAX', 'MRNA', 'MRNA', 'BUT', 'NVAX', 'COVID', 'NVAX', 'RSV', 'M', 'NVAX', 'B', 'I', 'B', 'M', 'EU', 'UK', 'IMO', 'B', 'I', 'IMO', 'B', 'I']|['NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX']

I am a fucking retard so my math is probably wrong, but if its not it proves that $DB is MASSIVELY overvalued and presents an enormous short opportunity for retail investors like ourselves. Also, it just happens to screw over one of the most evil and corrupt banks in the United States, if not the world. (They also have more than 300B in Debt)

Overshadowed by the recent infinite money glitch known as $GME and $AMC, $DB experienced THREE gigantic scandals in one week.

I used two of the formulas presented in the above article Benjamin Graham & P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)

1. Projected Price using Benjamin Graham Formula

1a. SQR ((15)(1.5)(.1)(0.2939)) = 0.81 (actual value per share)

2. P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)

2a. ((16.70)(0.1)) = 1.67 (intrinsic value)

&#x200B;

This means the actual *value* of the stock is *Drumroll Please...*

Between  $0.81 - $1.67

&#x200B;

If my math is correct (and it probably isn't), then this means that Deutsche Bank's stock is MASSIVELY overvalued and is due for a market correction (hence the AMAZING shorting opportunity). Also, if I am wrong please correct me - I only would like to learn more about the market, so I can eventually lose $5,000,000 in an earnings call.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Current Price = 10.12

&#x200B;

I do not want to mess up the momentum of $GME or $AMC, I am only posting this because in the same way that we LIKE those stocks, I think we should also be open to DISLIKING some of the worst stocks on the market. Especially stocks with ties to CNBC and the other hedge fund assholes who have enslaved us with debt.

&#x200B;

\*Full Disclosure: I do not have access to margin with my brokerage therefore limiting my ability to make this trade. I also lack the capital to do so. This post is not intended to be financial advice, rather an analysis of current market conditions.\*

TLDR:

Assholes at big bank fucked over world economy, and now these shitheads have too much debt. 

My positions are:

Ten shares of $AMC @ an avg price of 13.40

40 shares of some crappy penny stock (Frontier Comm.) @ $0.24

Two shares of NOK purchased @ $6.89"|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|['I', 'LOVE', '$AMC', '$GME', 'HATE', 'I', 'AZING']|['AMC', 'GME']|['FULL', 'AIMER', 'I', '$DB', 'IVELY', 'B', '$GME', '$AMC', '$DB', 'THREE', 'B', 'I', 'E', 'SQR', 'E', 'IVELY', 'AZING', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', '$GME', '$AMC', 'I', 'LIKE', 'I', 'IKING', 'CNBC', 'I', 'I', 'I', '$AMC', 'NOK']|['DB', 'GME', 'AMC', 'DB', 'GME', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'NOK']

I just got off a conference call with all your wives' boyfriends and I got some DD to drop on you. Everyone here knows about the big four stocks right now. If not, GTFO.

What I’m here to tell is to not focus 100% on these four and let other great opportunities pass you by. (Note – What I am NOT TELLING YOU is to sell your GME. Hodor that sh\*t). While you all have been foaming at he mouth over your GME games, you’ve likely missed what is going on with the rest of the market. Several great performing stocks have been dumping since this GME craze began. Oh, need examples?  To name a few you may have heard of: 

AAPL – Down 5.11% 

AMD – Down 7.7% 

BIDU – Down 7%

DOCU – Down 8.7%

F – Down 8.6%

PINS – Down 6.25%

NIO - down 8%

Wondering why this may be? Two theories They both might be right, or I might have a really smooth brain. 

1) These hedge funds everyone here is so keen on financially ruining need to cover their losses somehow. What better way than to liquidate stocks that have had crazy runs the last few months.  If this is true it will be extra enjoyable to watch them pay more to re-enter these positions when the stocks inevitably bounce back.

2) You people selling your shares in other stuff to buy more GME. (again, great job holding the line) I have seen several posts on here from other smooth brains selling their shares of some of those listed here. I applaud your enthusiasm for the cause and wish you the best. 

With these two combined, you end up with tons of shares dumping from these 401K stocks, with the buyers foaming at the mouth for more GME, NOK, AMC, BB. 

Once this is all over and the world of normies forget all about the GME madness, they are going to put their money back into their boomer stocks and standard 401K stocks. What does this mean for you? Don’t miss the dips happening all around you while the world is focused on 4 stocks and a shiba inu. If you have any extra money and cant afford GME, check out the rest of the market for buying opportunities. 

TLDR – Keep holding the line! If you have any money left, buy the dips on others for bonus tendies

See how retarded you are?? Everyone else is also just as retarded if not more. Most opinions you read and news you hear and rumors about anything are wrong, and genuinely dumb or ill thought out. I too may very well be retarded. 

Most of the takes on Robinhood are wrong. It’s a traffic jam. The same guard rails that are supposed to protect the plumbing of the system in an off ramp on the left side of the chart are slowing the system in the on ramp on the right side of the chart. You just can't open up millions of margin accounts a day trading stocks that move 300% a day. Even the most liquid brokerage quickly becomes very illiquid holding all the liable accounts. By Tuesday they will have enough liquidity and shares will have settled and retail will be able to buy en masse. Robinhood is the #1 app in the WORLD right now. This is only going to accelerate. They will get the plumbing right and add lines of credit. Credit markets are fine, so Robinhood can access capital. To the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀 

In addition, all the folks transferring accounts OUT of Robinhood cannot sell. It can take 3-5 days for a journal to clear. That is forced 💎🙌, which reduces the tradeable float of GameStop, increasing the short interest as a percentage of the float. 

We will see more buying pressure this week, forced holding by transfers, more institutional buying, and algorithms from quant funds like Renaissance Technologies analyzing everyone’s autistic thoughts, and following!!

**Breakdown of Restrictions by Brokerage: Worst to Best**

**RobinHood: (Worst)**

\- Trading restrictions limiting purchasing power to as little as 1-5 shares on over 50 stocks

[https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys)

\- Allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of GME and AMC during Thursday's trading rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\- Liquidity issues: RH is racing to raise 1$ billion from its existing investors as of Friday as many individuals are withdrawing their funds in protest of restrictions

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

**Interactive Brokers (garbage)**

\- Trading restrictions on GME/AMC/BB allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of these securities during Thursdays trading Rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\- CEO stated in CNBC interview they imposed restrictions to help out hedge funds (and stabilize the market)

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

[https://www.investopedia.com/robinhood-latest-broker-to-restrict-trading-of-gamestop-and-others-5100879](https://www.investopedia.com/robinhood-latest-broker-to-restrict-trading-of-gamestop-and-others-5100879)

**WeBull + ETrade (garbage)**

\- Trading restrictions on GME/AMC/BB allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of these securities during Thursdays trading Rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

**Schwab/TD Ameritrade (reasonable)**

\- Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\- Limiting short selling on volatile tickers (limiting trades with unlimited risk)

\- Raised margin requirements on many securities

\- Allowed trading of volatile securities once cash deposits were verified (many new accounts experienced this issue as new funds were not settled)

Both of these restrictions are reasonable as they have unlimited risk and are not trying to be liable for any substantial losses

**Fidelity/Vanguard (Best)**

\- Raised margin requirements on many securities

\- Limiting short selling on volatile tickers (limiting trades with unlimited risk)

Both of these restrictions are reasonable as they have unlimited risk and are not trying to be liable for any substantial losses

Thousands of upset retail investors will be fleeing RH, IBRK, Webull and Etrade over the next couple of weeks. Switching to Fidelity and Schwab/TD Ameritrade.

I would also go long Fidelity investments but it is not publicly traded.

**Schwab Analysis**

**User Growth:**

The amount of brand new retail investors opening up accounts over the past week is ridiculous. GME + AMC + BB pump has been blasted across every media station. Every online brokerage was experience server lag and strain over the past week due to the increased volume from new retail investors. Traffic on these sites were 3-4 times what they normally were during the recent trading frenzy.

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/schwab-vanguard-fidelity-suffer-service-problems-amid-trading-surge-51611773909?siteid=yhoof2](https://www.barrons.com/articles/schwab-vanguard-fidelity-suffer-service-problems-amid-trading-surge-51611773909?siteid=yhoof2)

RH/Webull/Etrade/IBRK transfers - many retail investors will be transferring over their accounts as a result of the trade restrictions and collusion with hedge funds. Listed below are the total accounts at each brokerage

RH: 13 million accounts

Etrade: 5.2 million accounts

Webull: 2 million accounts

IBRK: 700k accounts

Even if only a small portion of users switch brokerages 5-10% we are still looking at 1-2 million new accounts up for grabs between TD/Schwab/Fidelity/Vanguard

More users = more deposits/commission = more profits = stonks go up

**Reputation -** RH/Webull/Etrade/IBRK have had their app ratings and reputation destroyed thanks to reviewing bombing as a result of market collusion. These low reviews will discourage any new retail investors from using their platforms and push them towards TD/Schwab/Fidelity.

**Discount:**

$SCHW is trading at a 17% discount (as of PM on Friday) from its January high all while new retail investors and user registrations and deposits reached an all time high over the past week. Negative media coverage and market sell off this week has caused every publicly traded brokerage company to sell of from their highs. With a market rebound and new user registration data for January this stock will fly past its ATH's and run into the 70's.

**Average Daily Users**

The average daily website users has seen almost a 20% increase from the October 2020 numbers to December 2020 alone. The January numbers will even be substantially higher with TD Ameritrade and Schwab both reporting network strain due to the influx of new investors signing up last week to get into GME/AMC/BB. This trend wont be stopping anytime soon, the retail investor's strength is gaining. Just look at Wallstreetbets alone we had 2.2 million members as of Monday and now we are sitting at 7 million.

**Upcoming Earnings**

$SCHW is going to crush their upcoming earnings for Q1 2021 in April. They acquired TD Ameritrade on October 6. The amount of new retail investors has exploded over the last couple of months. Just look at last years growth in new accounts most brokerages have seen a over 100% increase in 2020 traffic. Their next earnings report for Q1 2021 will be the first quarter with 3 full months of combined revenue from both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab. There will also be a mass exodus of upset traders fleeing Webull, Etrade and Robinhood by the thousands and transferring their assets into TD Ameritrade and Schwab.

**Future/Longevity of Brokerages:**

TD Ameritrade/Schwab will be one of the few brokerages not being slammed by class action lawsuits as a result of the manipulation today. E Trade, RobinHood, IBRK and Webull will have users fleeing in the masses to new brokerages. Do you really want to leave your money sitting on a brokerages that may have pending lawsuits against it and possible liquidity issues? (looking at you Robinhood)

**Price Target:** Bank of America just upgraded $SCHW on January 12 giving it a $68 target. Stating their has been mass growth in retail users. This was prior to the new user explosion the past 2 weeks. This stock will easily run to $70 once data comes out for January 2021 on the amount of new users and transfers.

**TLDR:** $SCHW will crush its Q1 2021 earnings thanks to an explosion in new retail investors as a result of the media coverage on GME and AMC. Retail traders on platforms that halted trading activity on Thursday will also be transferring their holdings to Schwab + TD Ameritrade. $SCHW is at a discount thanks to the market sell off and will rebound to $70+ once registration data comes out for January.

Position: 02/05/2021 & 02/12/2021 $57 Calls

Calls are dirt cheap as this stock is seen as a boomer stock with low volatility.

EDIT: A few people saying TD/Schw/Fidelity were no allowing GME/BB/AMC trading. This may be a result of your cash not settling. New accounts needed their funds to settle before trading these higher volatility tickers. Any errors popping up may also be due to server strain, I was using TD and RBC in Canada and had issues finding tickers/entering into positions

EDIT 2: Schwab will be giving its winter business update on Tuesday at 11am. I expect them to discuss the massive growth in retail investors which should help this stock bounce.

EDIT 3: talked to a online agent about transferring over investments into Schwab.

Tendietime, memes, 🚀emojis🤝💎, whatever motivation you think you still need for tomorrow and the days after to just HOLD, **its actually much simpler.**

So mute your evening drawing class for a minute, chew your crayons to help you concentrate and focus on what im telling you.

We know:

**A) Shorts** [**bleed**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9dukq/its_working_melvin_capital_lost_53_in_january/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) **by holding short positions. Shorts desperately want to close positions.**

**B) To close, they have to buy stonks from us;** *saw a post earlier (help me find it?) saying we hold most of the shares.*

**C) If they buy, price goes up because we dictate the ask.**

so by easy, 2 braincell logic, whoever sells first, will automatically be the first to miss out on the tendies that follow.

Now idk about you guys, but my 3 braincells seem to only exist to make me think about what i missed out on,

>""why didnt i buy earlier"", ""why didnt i buy more"", ""why did i not take out a fucking loan"".

Im more okay with holding too long than too short

(fuck short anyways right?)

The essence is: what will you tell your 3 friends when they ask how much you made?

>""yea nah i sold at 600 haha, i know it went to 5000 but you know that old boomer who said you cant time the market haha? now lets go celebrate at wendys i'll let you guys choose anything you want from the dollar menu haha""

Dont be that guy

Now go back drooling at your art teachers cutout, delete your limit orders and when your artificial mistress Alexa wakes you up tomorrow with the generic ""I love you my lovely toilet-tiger"" and your old notification to sell on market open, tell her shes not real and ask if she allows you to stay in bed for 10 more minutes

TL;DR:

As soon as you sell, it drives the price up further because shorts have to cover and buy at our ask, therefore the sooner you sell, the more potential gains you will miss out on.

The board's objective is to make this a long-term win. It is not to either pump the price or burn the shorts. Burning the shorts is fun for them, but not their job. A significant cash infusion via capital raise (around $1 billion or so) would increase their positive outcomes a lot. There are a few ways to do this, but I think the best is a rights dividend/warrant offering where current shareholders get warrants. This would have some unpredictable effects on the stock and possibly cause some unpredictable short-term volatility, but would ultimately reduce volatility a lot..**

*Disclaimer: Not financial/investing/tax advice. I'm not a sell-side expert and don't have investment banking experience, but if any sell-side experts give me commentary on this thread I'll integrate and credit. I probably got some details wrong. I'm short-term bullish on this stock, but have a tiny long-term put position.*

Gamestop as a business would long-term benefit from more cash right now. They have 949m of long-term debt, and a bunch of leases they'd like to cancel (and severance payments they'd have to make with those store closures to laid off employees specific to those stores). They also would like to accelerate their development of more profitable businesses (such as eCommerce, any new ideas, and the rest). Extinguishing this debt completely, ditching bad stores, and investing in growth would all make sense to an extent, even if they turn around and issue new debt (at a much lower interest rate since their financial situation will be improved).

To do this, they need to raise capital. While they could use debt, I don't think that makes sense with equity at these values. Therefore, they will try equity if they do. The three approaches that make some sense (Also the three most frequent approaches) are to do a secondary offering (similar to an IPO, which is a primary offering), do an off-the-shelf offering (which they technically can already do $100m of), or do a rights distribution.

Additionally, GME will want to regain control of their stock. Tilray's founder commented on this recently, but basically, when the stock is like this, there are a lot of side effects  - more legal risks, any options or RSUs you issue employees stop being long-term motivating, a lot of early retirements as people cash out their options, and just a huge amount of press that is unrelated to your business goals. It's not actually good for the business to have a stock this volatile.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/tilray-ceo-brendan-kennedy-issues-a-warning-to-gamestop-amc-bosses.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/tilray-ceo-brendan-kennedy-issues-a-warning-to-gamestop-amc-bosses.html)

Here is some more detail of my non-professional understanding of these fundraising methods. I think a rights distribution is most likely.

**Secondary Listing:**

This would involve them bundling a bunch of institutions and offering new shares out, just like an IPO. The problem is that to do this, they have to offer at a discount. This will enrage current shareholders. This also will allow shorts to cover more or less immediately, which also will enrage the current shareholders. I think this one is bad press all around, and I think they'd have to offer a very large discount to get institutions comfortable with doing it given the daily volatility. They also open themselves up to lawsuits, because the price is very volatile, and if GME is, for example at $100 3 weeks from now, it's an instant lawsuit. by both current and new shareholders because the losses are so large. I think this is their worst option.

**Off The Shelf Listing:**

GME already has a $100m authorization for this. I suspect (but don't know) they already used it I believe there are some timing issues here, but this is the second best option. I think there are some timing delays on being able to use it, and there may still be some legal risks I'm unaware of. Optically, I think it looks not great because it will run contrary to the fervor gripping the stock right now and be seen as giving the shorts a bit of a lifeline.

**Public Rights Distribution:**

A write-up on this in general here:

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rightsoffering.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rightsoffering.asp)

I think this is their best option. In this, they would dividend out warrants to shareholders (this is an option, except you pay the company for the share and they make a new share, instead of someone having to sell you an existing share - so it dilutes. Usually this is done as 1 warrant per X shares. So for example, they might dividend out 1 warrant for every 5 shares held. They could then set a warrant exercise price that is low compared to the current price, but obviously not lawsuit bait, such as $20. Dividending out two warrants per 3 shares long at this price would likely result in full conversion right now, and raise them $1,000,000,000 roughly in cash.  Because these ONLY go to existing shareholders, it ends up not being dilutive in the same way other offerings are - everyone can preserve their share if they put capital in - does not punish longs. **Realistically though, they'll want to issue the fewest warrants possible at the highest price they can justify and avoid danger because the more warrants they issue, the more it increases the value of puts and can create unintended consequences.**

The way this would play out is that they'd first announce the rights distribution, probably a few days to a week before. This will result in some interesting market dynamics that I'll describe in a moment.

Then, you'd get the rights distribution as a GME long. As a GME short, you'd have to SERVE UP THE RIGHTS DISTRIBUTION to the long you borrowed shares from.  Because there are a lot more longs than shares, this would have some chaos, which the market makers would have to sort out.

Then, there would be a short time during which people have to elect to exercise the warrant, which you'd be able to do through your broker They'll want this as short as possible so that the price doesn't fall below the warrant price.

Then, they clear all the warrants, and a day or two later, deliver all the shares to people.

This is their best approach I think because it gets them capital without being pain to existing longs, while also reducing their lawsuit risk compared to the others because they are just distributing a right at a low price to existing longs on equal footing, who are the ones who have standing to sue them in the first place.

I don't know how the laws would work on insiders - I think they can exercise these, but I'm sure there are a lot of details on the timing of it. They probably need to do it well ahead of q4 earnings lockup to be clean.

**Rights Market Dynamics:**

I find this very hard to predict, but this would have a few effects.

1. Upon the warrants/rights being granted (NOT declared), stock will fall in price significantly, but longs shouldn't actually lose money because they also were granted warrants. In theory, warrant value + stock value for a given number of shares (plus their granted warrants) should be the same as the prior stock price. In other words, I don't really see it as bearish or bullish.
2. You would not want to be long call options through this. Very ITM calls and calls that expire before the distribution would be largely and completely unaffected respectively, but OTM longer dated calls would get destroyed the moment this is announced. If you do have an ITM call, you will want to get out of it before the distribution by either exercising to get shares, or selling it. If you sell and are still bullish, you can then go and buy shares. Would not recommend trying to buy OTM calls after this repricing, though I guess you could.
3. Puts are the reverse. Puts that are shorter dated than the distribution don't change. Puts that are longer dated go up in price a lot even though the total value of the company didn't change.
4. You could be short through this, but it's a little annoying. Most likely, you'll be marked short the warrant, so the warrant share structure will kind of mirror the current long structure, but this has to be closed out before the exercise date, so warrants will all get called in at some point. **In a sense, it's forcing shorts to cover a good portion of their short** since the warrant will arbitrage such that the warrants granted + stocks originally held = same value as the stock alone was before. They'd have to get the cash to buy warrants on the market to deliver to people you borrowed from. Likely a bit of a mess. Would cause some short covering, alongside that call selling. Would this be more buying or selling? I don't know, the stock is super levered. I don't think it would matter a lot initially though.
5. After the distribution happens, the stock should reduce volatility after the initial price renormalization of warrants distributed + original stock = same market cap (but stock price down). This will be more the case after shares delivered. The reason the volatility reduces is that this will reduce the leverage in the stock - calls on one side, short on the other. It also eliminates the bankruptcy thesis that shorts were in on in the first place.
6. GME would regain control of their stock and be set up for a faster turn-around.

The only downside of this is it's a bit less intuitive and will require significant explaining to people. But I think it's the most fair to existing shareholders, causes the least legal risk, and puts the company in an excellent position to do their turn-around.

What I'm uncertain on is if there are weird gamma squeeze dynamics from the share price being implied to be lower after a distribution. They may want to distribute more modestly than I'm suggesting for this reason.

**Other Unknowns:**

I don't know what restrictions are on how many warrants they can toss out and if shareholder votes are required. It seems to me it's close to a stock split, so maybe none? Any investment bankers have thoughts on this - minimum price they can offer a warrant if equal distribution to all shareholders? Maximum dilution? In situations where they have to issue warrants at or above current price, this obviously would not work at all. My sense is they can be at a discount, and can dilute, but may have maximums. Anyone able to confirm who is an expert?

**Timing**

My understanding which may be incorrect is they can’t do this before earnings. Their fiscal year I think ends this week? So they’d have to hurry to do this. Would not be surprised at an early earnings in order to facilitate. Early earnings is a tell that capital raise incoming."|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|['GME', 'I']|['GME']|['A', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'IPO', 'GME', 'I', 'IPO', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'I', 'X', 'ONLY', 'GME', 'GME', 'SERVE', 'UP', 'THE', 'IGHTS', 'UTION', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'NOT', 'I', 'ITM', 'OTM', 'ITM', 'OTM', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

You're not wrong, but theres some major issues.

It's a 1.5 Trillion dollar market cap. There is a hard case for the WSB, if acting in collusion which it shouldn't, cause that's naughty, to move silver.

Citadel, et al own a real stake in silver. Maybe deal with one issue at a time.  They would be enriched by this play, which effectively undoes doing them dirty.  Do you really wanna give them a reach around while you're savaging their red little asses?

Think about who owns the physical good.  This would cause physical silver to rocket, enriching some pretty nasty despots (both political and financial). None of this exists in a vacuum.

Every time someone has tried to mess with the silver market at scale it's blown up in their faces. Especially the Hunt brothers (Silver Thursday in 1980).  They literally lost their billion dollar family fortune in the mid 80's (from the stuff stemming from 1980)

Precious metals are a far more liquid market, with far greater trading times, and more world markets effecting price.  This means there are more players.  WSB was the David in the GME story, and won't register on the Silver market. You have COMEX & LBMA.

JPM is one of the big Market Makers.  Citadel et al aren't even a blip compared to JPM.

I'm saying it's not even bringing a knife to a gun fight.  It's bringing a rubber band gun to a nuclear arms meeting.

These MF's are gonna eat all your tendies for an appetizer and want more.

That said, the existing DD has had very very valid points.  Silver is logically a sound investment, especially after QE Eleventy Billion.  I'm saying bleach your mind of the thought of attempting to impact the silver market.

How do we relate this to GME?

Now, I'm not in love with the wave cycle above  and that we appear to be on relative to the Long term stages of this movement to be completely honest, and after including the PM/AH price movements... It appears that on Thursday morning GME had started the first move in it's final impulse wave higher to find the peak; Meaning, the *squeeze was very likely to be squoze* going into into Thursday's Open Market had retail not been almost totally restricted from buying.

 (See chart Below; (5) would've been 'peak' - perhaps around 1k/share.)

[Think of it this way - without restricting buying, retail would've bought the PM\/opening dips like crazy, solidifying the first impulse wave & sending us off into another Gamma Squeeze\/Short-Squeeze combo. This was already AFTER the drop in the general markets on Wednesday, what I suspect to have been a result of big-boys liquidating longs.](https://preview.redd.it/e7ng28xsjpe61.png?width=1518&format=png&auto=webp&s=704cd948d59d85cf149eba94ba49a60f1cfc6c0f)

Finally, a bit of AMC analysis.... Here we see a similar story to GME, appearing to be within a rising wedge, ready to start its next impulse wave upwards. 3-6 mo PT of $28

\- Monke's that are FOMO'ing GME, watch the price-action of PM.  

\-Monke's almost exposed a financial meltdown on Thursday, good shit

Many of us are probably watching the short interest % of float to indicate when the short squeeze is squoze. At this point, the hedge funds clearly know this, given how hard they've spent the last couple days using their MSM shills to announce ""WE HAVE EXITED OUR SHORT POSITIONS!!! YOU WIN!""

There is a chance we're going to see that short interest % of float number go down at the same time as the price drops. Failure-to-delivers may also go down, at least in appearance.

# This is probably a lie.

Failure-to-deliver numbers and the short interest % are just the tip of the giant dildo they're trying to fuck us with. If this thing is actually what it looks like, they have way, way, *way* more exposure to this shitstorm than they are letting on.

There are ways for hedge funds and their colluding market makers to hide their exposure to a counterfeit stock scheme / naked short / short attack. You can read all about it here: [counterfeiting stock 2.0](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) (again, credit to johnny for bringing this to our attention)

If you don't know how to read, just scroll down to the picture of the iceberg.

If you **do** know how to read but don't have a lot of time, still scroll down to the picture of the iceberg, and start reading from there.

**TL: DR**\-- using a bag of dirty tricks, hedge funds can ""unwind"" their *disclosed* short positions, without ever having to exit their *real* short positions-- the ones that are actually super dangerous and putting them at risk of insolvency. They are going to do everything they can to get us to sell, **up to and including fucking with the disclosed short interest % of float-- the number we're all watching.**

So watch the short interest with a titanic-sized grain of salt. It could go up, it could go down, but it's likely not anywhere close to their real risk exposure either way.

My GME positions:  4 @ 329, 2 @ 325, 13 @ 272.

I originally bought in at $14 and sold at $19 like a paper-handed bitch.Now I'm holding until $10,000.

*I'm an ape, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, this is not financial advice, do your own research, etc.*

**EDIT:** if you have a lot of time on your hands and want some more research on how this works and maybe a little peek into what we're in for, see u/Sleavitt10's comment [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9jbc5/listen_to_me_we_cannot_trust_the_short_interest/glib7cs/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

**EDIT 2:** people are pointing out that that source I’m using says short squeezes aren’t really possible anymore, because counterfeiting can overcome any amount of buy-side pressure. And normally I would agree, but there are exceptions.

Like when a counterfeiting scheme runs into a multi-million-man army of enraged retail investors who are willing to buy the stock at any price, for example. And remember, the longer this goes on, the more they lose, so they are highly motivated to produce a quick resolution. The desperate moves on Thursday and Friday that ultimately failed are proof of what a serious situation this is becoming for them.

The sheer number of retail investors who are buying this stock just to fuck up the short attack is absolutely mind boggling. So long as we maintain our numbers and resolve, they must spend more and more money to get out of the hole.

Hold. The. Line.

**EDIT 3:** [IT'S ALREADY FUCKING HAPPENING.](https://twitter.com/jonpeterswrites/status/1356019766624923654) 6 hours ago shorts weren't covering, and suddenly they've covered 30 mil on 50 mil volume? I don't fucking THINK so. And even if they are, that doesn't unwind the 2-3x as many shorts built on top of imaginary shares.

So far so good.

The problem with SLV is that silver IS NOT A CENTRALIZED MARKET!

The biggest silver market is COMEX, which is a futures market. See, futures markets aren't the same thing as single stock markets, they are much bigger, have more institutions rather than retail investors and they are much more complicated.

When a typical retard buys gme, they hit buy market and that's it, they now have 1 share. 

In futures, it's different. You buy contracts, these contracts are standardized and the most popular contract for silver is : SI . SI has a contract size of 5000 troy ounces!! One contract is equal to  135000 $ worth of silver. You don't need to pay 135k for a contract, you can buy it for 14k if you close the position before you need to take delivery of the silver.

Some of you might have 14k, but the risk is very high: if silver moves down 1 dollar you lose 5k.

Another problem in the silver market are the participants: goverments own silver, hedge funds own silver, investment funds own silver, too many people own too much silver!! Gamestop is at about 30 billion dollars marketcap ( and that's now ). 

The open interest on the latest SI contract is 135 960, giving it an open interest value (which admitedly is not marketcap) of 18.354.600.000 usd. 18 billion usd in just open interest. 

Open interest is how many positions are open at any given time.

Silver is a much bigger market, with more big players.

GME - there weren't so many hedge funds (poor Melvin, that was the one big hedge fund shorting gme) and so it was a subreddit against a fund, and we won.

Silver is a different story - JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi, hedge funds, governments, a lot more money is in silver than gme.

For these reasons, don't go into SLV, you will just play where the big boys want you to play, they have the advantage there.

tl;dr : Silver won't moon, banks have advantage, hold gme to 10k."|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|['SLV']|[]|['SLV', 'IS', 'NOT', 'A', 'LIZED', 'ARKET', 'COMEX', 'SI', 'SI', 'SI', 'GME', 'JP', 'SLV']|['GME']

Before breaking down why this is important, let's quickly recap some of the highlights of last week:

GameStop had one of its first big pops to open the market Wednesday and remained volatile all day. Thursday, it opened with another significant pop, and then HFs employed some perfectly timed and very illegal market manipulation tactics. Some of the largest brokerages with the most retail investors blocked the purchase of GME shares, and only allowed the current investors to sell the stock. HFs coupled this restriction in free trade with what is commonly referred to as a short ladder attack, which is another form of market manipulation to fabricate the illusion that a stock is plummeting. Newly invested retail traders watched this play-out over the course of the day, and with only the option to sell and seeing their initial investment plummet quickly probably sold the shares, freeing them for Hedge Funds to scoop up. 

Friday morning opened with another pop and the SEC issued a statement that they will be closely monitoring the price volatility of certain stocks, which put HFs on notice, and publicly acknowledged that they are paying attention to the situation. Meanwhile, trade across many of the brokerages that had previously blocked their customers from buying reopened the option to buy, but with significant restrictions. 

🖐💎**TL;DR RE: LAST WEEK 💎🖐**

Starting Wednesday, GME opened everyday with a big pop likely due to the fever pitch of news and interest combined with HFs slowly covering their positions. Tomfoolery was rampant as HFs tried to tamp down a potentially imminent squeeze. 

🖐💎**SELL LIMIT ORDERS 💎🖐**

Okay, so why are sell limit orders so important this coming week? Or many of you may even be asking WHAT IS a sell limit order? To borrow a very succinct analogy: if you are an 🦍 holding a 🍌, the sell limit order is the number you tell your brokerage you're willing to sell your 🍌for. This number can be seen by the market, and the HFs can see these numbers, but more importantly, they can see ALL of them. This is key because depending on how long you've been tracking GME on WSB, you have likely seen several comments saying something along the lines of ""$420.69 IS NOT A MEME"" and it has continually increased from 1k, 5k, 10k, etc. Which is where we get to the meat of this post because if everyone sets the sell limit orders to these memeable numbers, the HFs can see these massive clusters of sell orders and WILL buy them, which will trigger massive drops in share price, and in turn likely cause panic selling much like we saw during the short ladder attack on Thursday. So what next?

**I DONT FUCKING KNOW CAUSE I AM NOT OFFERING FINANCIAL ADVICE, ONLY KNOWLEDGE AS UNDERSTOOD BY ME**

But here's the thing: these particular HFs have turned the market into a game, and a very select few badasses noticed this early on, and then started playing. After much due diligence by the thousands of redditors on this sub, more and more people learned the rules, saw an opportunity, and bought shares of GameStop because they like the stock. These HFs are now counting on all of us retail investors, especially those who are playing on hard mode and don't understand the market, to cut and run and give them an out. 

🖐💎**TL;DR💎🖐**

These particular hedge funds have turned the market into a game. They used cheat codes all last week, and are literally banking on newer retail investors who are playing on hard mode to lose and give them an easy out. Educate yourself as much as possible on the rules and make your own personal informed decision on if you want to set sell limit orders and what that number should be.

You use your money exactly how you see fit and take responsibly for your own trades. Secondly this is not a ""squeeze"" play.

Nokia is one of the largest telecommunication companies in the world, as well as one of the front running companies for 5G.  Nokia now has a significant hold in all of the world’s early 5G adopters. Including deals with the top four communication service providers in the United States as well as the top three providers in Japan and Korea. Multinational contracts and deals have placed Nokia at the top when it comes to 5G and it will only be getting bigger when 5G is more accessible to people like us. Last week we ran Nokia up to almost 9 dollars before multiple halts stopped all the momentum. Then the trading restrictions on Robinhood and other brokerages hurt the momentum even more. I believe this was to help the hedge funds cover there ass before the inevitable movement up were going to have in the future. With trade restrictions being lifted on most platforms and earnings coming on Thursday we should see a big move up. This is a value company, with huge room for growth. The hedge funds manipulated this hard dropping from 6 to 4.60. We will not let them win and short another great company into the ground. Nokia is one of the most undervalued stocks on the market. The more we go up the more hedge funds will try and short. Buy shares and hold for a long time. This is a great company.

This has escalated faster than my dick when DFV posts, While pretty much everyone who bought into GME sub 20 knew there were massive tendies to be made, not single person in this entire scenario expected it to play out like this.  


Lets take a step back and review the FACTS, amidst the bot attacks, fake news, and overall noise coming from the powers at be.

1. **Gamestops long term prospects look good: marketing, $$$ and more $$$**

fundamentals are what we care about as the business needs to go through a paradigm shift in its model, thankfully, it has. We can all thank new daddy cohen for making this happen by investing in the long term strategy for revamping a business that was on its way out. He involved himself on the board, brought in his former chewy associates, and is making bigly moves to start setting up their pivot. Gamestop would naturally start to increase as speculators saw serious financial backing from an independent investor with an alignment between management and shareholders starting to form. Obviously when board members and c-suits are shareholders they have vested interest in the performance of the company, if you go and [read wikipedia on gme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop) you will see that they did not have any shareholders in upper level management, until 2019 which helped create the situation we are in, if the people running the company do not care about the value of it, they have no concern to prevent the value from being destroyed. So yay, management now gives a fuck. we have our first ingredient, ***aligned $$$***

Now on to the second ingredient, big $$$

Gamestop has to finance its operations for 2019 and 2020 as it went deep into the red, the lack of free cash flow and poor sales prospects drilled their credit rating to emerging market status, and set them up to fail if they could not find profits again, which with shit management is to be expected. With the new interest from stakeholders, GME took off, gaining market cap, and opening up a new avenue of financing. Even if GME hit a modest market cap of lets say 6.5bb, they would have been able to raise money without diluting the float by much. But now with a market cap approaching 20+bb its becoming absurdly easy for them to raise capital, hell even raising a cool billion becomes viable now via a secondary offering.   Gamestop has become a self fulfilling prophecy as of no amount of shorting can sustain a low value for the stock, so they have a solid avenue to raise more cash. Which in turn means they can pay off their debt, increase their credit rating, and what do you know all of the sudden they can become profitable again.   


third ingredient: attention and faith.

self explanatory, the whole hedge fund situation has brought more media attention to gamestop than any other form of marketing, now literally everyone and their mother will know about GME forever and a lot of people who used to engage with the brand are now flocking back. Now combine that with the faith that new daddy cohen has inspired you have a recipe for MASSIVE TENDIES

&#x200B;

now when we combine, aligned monetary interests, with new financing capability, huge investor confidence on management AND brand awareness. well fuck me thats one hell of a grand slam. 

with these few ingredients GME can cook up so many tendies, we already know they are working on making PC gaming more mainstream, and with all the renewed interest they can definitely pivot to some more interesting revenue streams, think the nintendo center in NYC for the heads who know, gamestops could become these social venues where gamers meet up and play together, or maybe hangout and have a beer. adult gaming and entertainment is actually taking off with the millennials and I expected it to be a serious path forward for gamestop. maybe not exactly like a video game bar, but some form of live social-gaming experience is something that I think is highly likely they will integrate. 

2. The financial institutions have their back against the wall, nothing can save them other than a gov bailout, its really a matter of closing the loss on the way down.

There is no fucking way on this planet that these shorters walk away from this in one piece, i do not think they will become insolvent because you know, wall street, but there is no way they do not take heavy losses. The sheer grit from new comers, lurkers, big names, and OGs is unspeakable. people have taken this scenario personally and people are just throwing money at this simply to say, BEARS R FUKT HEDGIES EAT COCK, which is not something this hedge fuckers could have seen coming. They have an innate arrogance that prevents them from considering such things. They know how much money they control, how to influence the right people, and their all homies with the important people so why should they care about the little guy when they can bend us over and fuck us whenever they want? well jokes on them cuz my wife's boyfriend already went to pound town and my ass can handle the pain. And guess what? SO CAN EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS GAME NOW, people are just buying, buying, and then buying some more, no matter the financial hurt, the buy side pressure has not and will not degrade(maybe when we hit 500+ a share since a lot of people might get priced out then) but it is a losing battle for them as every retail buy takes another share off the market. So they are in a pretty pickle. the longer they wait us out, the fewer shares they have to work with. The higher the price the more they bleed, the more they short, the worse it gets. Basically the longer they wait the more fucked they are, so HOLD because they will be trying everything we have seen this past week on us to get us to sell, become distracted, create FUD, prevent us from buying, restrict options, you name it. 

&#x200B;

All we need are these two points and you can start to see how there is literally no way out for these guys, the challenge, the real challenge ( that gives us our diamond hands) is waiting. yes PATIENCE, as buffet has once said, "" The stock market is a device to transfer money from the impatient to the patient"". WE ARE THE PATIENT, WE ARE STRONG TOGETHER, WE ARE THE FUCKING PLAYERS. And the hedgies know it. they are the impatient ones as each day they lose money, and each day they have to ***work*** to remain afloat. Every single person on this sub does not need to do shit other than buy GME when you see it at a price you like and never sell until the shorts have bled all their capital. 

&#x200B;

TLDR; GameStop has all the ingredients to generate, real long term value for their shareholders, be patient. The shorts have already lost, its a matter of how much now, be patient, the hedgies have to work everyday to figure out how to unfuck themselves, while we just has to scroll WSB and find confirmation bias DD like this one. pretty simple, be patient, watch shorts cry, make unlimited tendies. DO NOT LET ANYONE INFLUENCE YOUR DECISION ON WHETHER TO BUY OR SELL GME, MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS AND STAND BY THEM. I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL, THESE ARE MY OPINIONS, NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE

# GameStop Short Nightmare Shows Few Signs of Becoming a Contagion

[GameStop Corp.’s](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GME:US) surge has struck fear into anyone caught on the wrong side of its ascent. But those **bearish positions probably aren’t big enough to lay low the larger universe of investment funds**.

That’s the view of Barclays Plc strategists led by Maneesh Deshpande. By plotting the value of bearish equity bets versus the whole market’s capitalization, they found that short sales have actually dwindled during the past year to the lowest level since at least 2008. Moreover, those **most-heavily shorted companies targeted by day traders this year had bearish wagers amounting to less than 0.001% of the $43 trillion market.**

Whether losses being suffered by hedge funds and other money pools will be large enough to ignite a full-blown contagion was a concern that arose several times during last week’s selling -- the worst in the S&P 500 since October. For now, while Reddit-fueled stock jocks may have drowned out every other narrative, they’re unlikely to completely subsume the bull market.

 “We’re witnessing a nearly unprecedented amount of speculative activity. But on the other hand, **we are talking about a very narrow group of stocks that don’t have an outsize influence**,” said Marshall Front, chief investment officer at Front Barnett Associates. “**The underlying fundamentals of the economy are strong. A very aggressive and accommodative policy by the Federal Reserve is still intact. Together, they help the stock market on the way up**.”

Burned by short sales going against them, hedge funds have yanked money from the market at one of the fastest rates on record. The most-shorted stocks rallied 14% last week as a group, dealing the biggest blow to short sellers since last April, a [Goldman Sachs Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US) basket shows.

While the **S&P 500 dropped more than 3% last week, traders described the broad market as orderly**. To JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s strategists including Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, the retreat is likely a “short-lived technical tumble.” With earnings improving and U.S. consumers strengthening, this pullback is another opportunity to add stocks, particularly those geared toward an economic recovery, the strategists wrote in a Friday note.

 To be sure, day traders are targeting companies favored by bearish investors, trying to spur squeezes. In 2021, the top quintile of the Russell 3000 stocks with the highest short sales as a percentage of their float is up 20%, compared with a loss of 0.8% for the bottom 600, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But those returns are also consistent with a contour that was already taking shape as investor risk appetite increased: gains in companies with shakier finances, which had trailed during 2020’s pandemic market.

“Although the short squeeze started with GME, it appears to be spreading to a wider range of stocks,” Deshpande at Barclays wrote in a note Friday, referring to GameStop’s ticker. “While we expect some more deleveraging, ultimately the scale of the problem appears quite limited.”

By Barclays’s tally, **short sales totaled $800 billion, or roughly 2% of the total market value of American equities, a sign that short sellers have not extended themselves**. The heavily shorted companies -- those with interest making up more than 20% of their share float -- saw $40 billion of their stock sold short, or 5% of the total pool of bearish bets.

“We remain optimistic that it is likely to remain localized,” Deshpande said. “**The bottom line is that while the pain could continue in the short term, the risk of a full-fledged contagion remains low**.”"|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|['SPY', 'CALLS', 'VIX', 'PUTS', 'HOLD']|[]|['GME', 'SPY', 'VIX', 'GME', 'I', 'P', 'A', 'P', 'U', 'S', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME']

This has been posted before but I think it’s VERY important to know, maybe even should be pinned.


We don’t know if/which brokerages will be instituting buy-order restriction’s on GME etc this week.   If anyone who is interested (and can afford to) still wants to buy shares, know that it is still possible to EXERCISE your call options.  By exercising, they are required to give you the 100 shares you bought.

**How does it work?**


ELI5:  each Call contract is for 100 shares at the strike price.  You’d want to purchase deep ITM Calls, with minimal extrinsic value left in the contract.  On Robinhood, this is manifested as the “To Break Even%”, where this number would ideally be 0% for immediate exercise.

https://imgur.com/a/5VGZvxZ

On other brokerages such as ToS displayed in the link as well, you may just have to do some quick maths to figure out the relative costs.


**How do I know if exercising is worth it?**

Immediately Exercising a Call is supposed to be similar to buying 100 shares outright, right?  But since immediate exercise isn’t how options are usually used, there will be some extra costs involved.

Math:

If $GME is at $300, it would cost $30,000 to buy 100 shares at $300 each.  
**100 shares = $30,000**

If we do this via a (theoretical) option:
Lets say GME is at $300 still.  And lets say the $45 strike Call for Feb.5 costs “$285” each.  You’ll pay that $285 to buy the contract.  Now if you want to exercise that contract, you will pay another $45 for each of the 100 shares you’re exercising the right to buy.
In this example, (45+285)*100 = 33,000
**100 shares = $33,000**


*(strike price + contract cost) x 100 = the cost to immediately buy 100 shares via options*



Obviously this isn’t ideal,  but if RobbingHood et. al. continue their restrictions, this will likely be how I will purchase shares of a stock I like.   I would likely be paying an extra premium per share as you saw, *BUT WHO CARES ABOUT PAYING EXTRA IF WE’RE GOING TO THE MOON ANYWAY*


**How do I exercise an option (on RobbingHood??**

On RH there’s a handy little “Exercise” button when you click on your Call.  You’d just click through the screens to do it.  https://imgur.com/a/BGKCnz1



I’m sorry if formatting is bad and the explanation was *quick and dirty* but I have a feeling many of us will be stuck holding and unable to buy shares outright once again.  If you have questions I Will try to answer in the comments, and if anyone has something better to explain then feel free.

Mercury is also the Roman god of financial gain, commerce, luck, trickery and thieves.

Mercury was known to the greeks as hermes.  Hermes Trismagestrus means Hermes thrice great.  If Hermes and Mercury are the same, then Hermes thrice great = Mercury Mercury Mercury = HgHgHg.

Hermes Trismagestrus was thought to have known the three parts of the wisdom of the whole universe - Alchemy, Magic, and Astrology.  Alchemists turn things into gold.  

The number 3 is also symbolic of Abundance, or opportunity.

So either NYSE is saying that there's a lot of opportunity for financial gain, the only question is whether or not it's by buying GME, or milking the retail investors for all they've got.

Hg is also a private equity firm that targets buyouts primarily in Europe and the US.  So maybe they're saying their name 3 times in hopes they show up.

Some of you know I’m a big BB bull on $BB 

I love the stock, I love the company, I love John Chen, but it’s finally clear why BB has been moving the way it has, in tandem with GME 

Prem Watsa is a huge BB investor and owns a large stake 

Guess who Watsa has beef with? Steve Cohen, the guy supporting Melvin in GME, the final boss so to speak of Point72 with deep ties to Citadel  

[Watsa vs Cohen beef](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.theglobeandmail.com/amp/globe-investor/fairfax-e-mails-come-back-to-haunt-a-wall-street-titan/article571008/)

These are billionaires in financial warfare 

Steve Cohen’s tried to kill Watsa’s Fairfax fund. In turn killing Blackberry. Cohen’s group are the hostile players with MASSIVE capital that have been punishing BlackBerry for years 

It’s obvious now why BB SP has been so low in the market. It’s because Steve Cohen has tried to squash it due to his beef with Watsa. Same thing they’ve been doing with GameStop, but BlackBerry is more personal for Cohen 

Don’t believe me? Look at the daily chart for GME and BB 

GME had its first squeeze on Jan 13th, from $20 to $40. 100% gain. This was an astronomical loss for Melvin, who is backed by Cohen 

Guess when Blackberry began its epic run? Check the chart... Jan 14th, MASSIVE green candle 

December 22nd, random and short BB surge out of nowhere, was so random it shocked me as I thought it might even halt for news. The move faded. 

Check GME chart December 22nd, same day GME posted its first big power move from $16 to almost $20. Again Cohen group taking the edge of BB and moving it to GME. Clear as day now. 

This BB surge is Cohen’s group backing off their BB short, pushing the price up, and shoring up enough funds to move to GME which was hemorrhaging HUGE outflows. Retail and momentum exasperated this move in BB

This is so God damn obvious now in hindsight. This is why BB has been moving in tandem with GME 

This movement is not organic, has nothing to do with fundamentals, or even Blackberry itself!

This is a war between Cohen (Point72, Citadel, Melvin) and anonymous long hedge funds + retail. These anonymous long hedge funds are either using retail or are siding with retail. In the end, funds don’t give a shit about anything besides profit. So be careful, they don’t care about sending any message

Investing in BB right now is investing in Cohen losing his shirt in GME

I know I’ll get hated for this but it’s true and needs to be said 

CONSIDER: 

1) Deleverage, get off margin, don’t YOLO
2) Hedge with puts 
3) Scale some out 

You’re investing in between a financial tug of war that runs deep and is directly tied to the outcome of GME. You are not investing in fundamentals of BlackBerry right now! If Cohen uses political leverage which it looks like he has already, stabilizes his position in GME, he will go on the offensive and come back for blood in BB. Just be careful. This is crazy stuff.

Edit: LOL this place has gone wild and become an echo chamber.

If you have EXTRA money and are already hodling GME, or cannot afford GME you should join the BLNK train.**

So let me preface this by saying **BLNK** will not be the next **GME**. There will probably not be another **GME**. For starters it's not going to have an army of kids who used to shop there 15 years ago hyping it, not to mention over 100% short interest and the fact that in the early days it wasn't even 1b dollar market cap.. But it can a squeeze of it's own for it's own reasons entirely and so I have spent time looking beyond just the stock price movements which is what initially led me to start the idea of a **BLNK** DD. I do want to point out some things I noticed while the big squeeze started happening.

* A lot of companies with high short interest such as **IRBT** and **BLNK**, along with those more talked about companies such as **AMC** just started causing the shorts to cover all sorts of positions and move their money around. **BLNK** share price was up to about 65 dollars before falling down to 50 over the past 2 days. It has reached 55 dollars in the past so this wasn't even a squeeze it was just a few shorts deciding to cover their positions most likely because they were getting reamed elsewhere, or just a natural run up because people seem to really like **BLNK** stock. As a matter of fact, they like it so much that it is up *2400%* from 1 year ago. And it's still got relatively small market cap though we aren't in the millions anymore.
* If **BLNK** were to actually squeeze as hard as some of these other companies  have been and somehow reach **GME**'s current 20b dollar market cap it's share price would be $500 dollars. There are plenty of companies with 20 billion dollar market cap. If it just pulled an **AMC** and only jumped 200% in a day it would still be at 150 dollars. Of course if you believed **GME** squeezed already you're obviously mistaken yourself, but the sentence still applies that **BLNK** 10x would still leave it at only 20b market cap.

Is this realistic? Lets take a look at the ways in which **BLNK** is SETTING ITSELF UP to make money in the future, and I say that because as we go into details later you will realized they are currently not exactly succeeding financially, though when has that stopped a company from turning into a success in the past? We will also take a little bit of look at the short interest. Also, these are the kinds of companies who continue to gain more short interest as the price continues to rise.

Okay so **BLNK** is not some new company who just started because of the EV hype, **BLNK** has been a public company since only 2018 but has been a private company since 2008. They had a different name, but merged and acquired a few companies or something, and somehow ended up with the name **BLNK**. Many companies fight for years to break out of the depths of nothingness into a sound business model. According to their CEO: They design, manufacture, maintain, own, and operate charging stations. Their main business goal is to be the owner and operator, so they can be the fuel of the future. They put their focus on areas where you have no other choice but to use public charging.

**BLNK revenue comes from a few different things:**

* **Selling charging equipment:** They sell to third parties Okay, this is not great, but when you add the fact that they are **VERTICALLY INTEGRATED** it really changes the narrative a bit. **AAPL** just decided to go vertically integrated by designing building their own chips for their products, when you design your product and control the supply chain you can make greater strides to improving your margins and expanding your business through natural growth.
* **Utilization**: from people utilizing their charging stations, this is standard and easy to understand. They apparently pay about .12 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity and charge about .39 cents per kilowatt hour. These are pretty good margins and once more than 50% of the cars are the road become EVs this is going to grow exponentially. This will obviously take time but might not be as far away as people are trying to say either.
* **Network of charging stations:**  **BLNK** has it's own cloud based network which will collected *recurring* fees every month. It will also need to be managed, which is also recurring fees. This is also where shit gets interesting because they can use data integration of the network on top of utilization. Of course utilization is going to cost people money but what do we know about companies abilities to collect and sell data in the **AGE OF DATA**? We know that **DATA** is the next oil, that's something we do know, how long and how far will people go to learn your every move, where you charge your car, what stores you're nearby, for how long, etc. This data is will be worth money in time. (side note: **PLTR** LEAPS AFTER THE LOCKUP TARDS)

**BLNK Expansion, Growth, Partnerships, Deals, Future revenue streams**

* **BLNK** recently acquired BlueLA, an EV carsharing company. This was a big move for a little company with negative earnings and cash flow, the fact that they are acquiring things leads me to believe they are actively trying to expand, and beyond just chargers as well. They seem committed to take on the EV industry without being a car manufacturer.
* **BLNK** inked a deal with Cushman and Wakefield, for those of you who do not know they are a global commercial real estate services firm.
* International expansion. **BLNK** has a deal in Greece with **Nissan** to provide chargers to anyone who buys an electric **Nissan**. These people will get access to all of **BLNK**'s network. Let me inform you simpletons who have never left your moms basement, in other countries they are taking the whole EV movement more serious than America has been for some time, with certain countries already having pledged to ban gas powered cars by certain dates. I know the USA is making strides too and not to mention we have Elon but even if penetration is slow here it will not be slow internationally.
* **BLNK** announced on Dec. 15th it was signing an *exclusive* deal with Blessing Health System.
* When **BLNK** signs these types of exclusive deals it often times has contracts for 5-15 years to be the sole provider of charging within the property, this includes charging of all types of equipment not only electric cars.
* **BLNK** received a grant aimed at facilitating the deployment of 200 Blink Fast Level 2 - 19.2 kW charging stations across the mid-Atlantic region, including locations in Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia and Washington, DC. I smell more grants with incoming administration.
*  On 28th of July, **BLNK** and **ENS** entered an agreement  to jointly develop high-power wireless and enhanced DC (direct current for you actual retards) fast charging (DCFC) systems with integrated battery storage for the transportation market. This shows they are looking ahead and willing to work with whoever they need to stay on top of the technology. The resulting DCFC charging solution with high power energy storage will purportedly feature a modular design, and a power output from 100-500 kW. Supposedly it is going to be “economically priced”. They are going to look like the concrete parking guard things we see all over the place and they will be able to wireless charge certain vehicles is the idea.
* On the topic of DC chargers (non wireless). **TSLA** uses this same tech for it's superchargers. What else are DC chargers going to allow in the future? Bi directional charging! With bi-directional charging you can go Vehicle to Grid or Vehicle to Home . This means cars can one day be used to help balance energy needs by allowing EVs to charge during off peak hours and give back during peak hours. This is futuristic shit. Lots of stuff to be excited about. If you are confused and don't care about the future, all you need to know today is that direct current chargers have the converter in the charger itself, so they are bigger and faster at charging cars than the AC converters which have to have an onboard converter which converts AC into DC to feed the battery.  It is also going to lead to people to wanting and needing more advanced charging solutions in their home rather than using the ""well I can just charge over night"" logic with a slow level 1 charger. Having the charger do the conversion is the way of the future. This is the way.
* **VERTICAL INTEGRATION**. Did I fucking mention they are a vertically integrated charging company? This is huge. This needs reiteration. This means they design their own product plus build their own infrastructure out, not to mention provide own their own network, technicians, everything. It is very ambitious and nobody knows how far **BLNK** can take their business yet, but what we do know is that EVs are the future and it is still only the beginning of the EV revolution. Advantages of Vertical Integration include lower costs, faster getting products to consumers, less supply disruption or them raising the price on the company, less transportation costs and reduced delivery turnaround times, improved sales and profitability. I really think this is big to the companies growth trajectory yet it is not widely available information about the company.

**Some Other Points to Consider**

* Supposedly **BLNK** has the only 80 amp level 2 charging station currently on the market. Why does this matter to the small brained? That means it's faster than other chargers you say? Sure, that could be technically true, if that's what it was used for. Then why does it matter? Because **BLNK** chargers have **load-sharing capabilities**. The **BLNK** IQ 200 has the ability to load-share between 2 and 20 units from a single 100 amp feed. This is going to be a game changer for apartments, hospitals, any MUD's, honestly any commercial space that has access to a hundred amp feed. They will be able to service many cars with that single feed. But it gets better, the IQ 200 can intelligently share power, and even queue up cars that are plugged in but not charging, so that they can charge once other cars finish charging. **BLNK** envisions higher output being necessary to facilitate larger companies electric fleets, which we can now see happening in the EV space with trucks and couriers looking to go electric. 
* **BLNK**'s pricing scheme seems to be superior to that of **Chargepoint**. For those of you who do not know **Chargepoint** is another EV charging company, who was recently acquired by **SBE** and they are voting in February to finalize everything I believe. With **Chargepoint** they just sell the chargers to apartments and such and let them determine the pricing. They only manage the network. This means if you have to fill your battery up you have to constantly double check prices to see if you are getting reamed from one of their chargers vs another one. On **BLNK**'s network they will charge the same price everywhere. This is a huge plus in my eyes. I am a little unclear which policy would be in effect for chargers that **BLNK** does not have on it's network, because as I've said it does sell equipment as well.
* **BLNK** has mobile chargers with the same power as their IQ 200 but in a mobile factor in case you run out of fuel on the road.
* **BLNK** does not give a shit to what kind of car you drive, it wasn't to fuel all electric vehicles of the future.
* Fleets are coming, **BLNK** seems ready for this.
* **BLNK** can have partnerships with and target the following sectors which we already see some starting to play out: Parking & Services, Commercial & Residential, Workplace, Healthcare, Education, Retail, Hospitality/Food & Beverage, Entertainment, Governmental.
* Consumer stores that add EV charging stations tend to see costumers staying in their stores longer according to data which I have not seen. This reiterates the point about being able to collect money from data.
* So you may or may not know that in the USA **TSLA** still owns about 80% market share of EVs. We also know this will not last forever as every car company and their mother's boyfriend on top of car companies we've never even heard of are all on the EV bandwagon right now. This is going to make a lot of cars that need charging stations and it will be impossible for any one company to win this battle we can safely assume there will be 2-4 major players.
* Low estimates are expecting the amount of charging stations in America to jump from between a quarter and a half million now, depending on if you are counting Gen 1, to low estimates stating there will be between 13 and 14 million charging stations over the next 7 or 8 years.

**The Possible Concerns that keep getting thrown around**

* **BLNK** seems to be issuing more public shares from time to time (yes, dilution) but we know that when a company is trying to raise capital to expand this is a common strategy, and I don't really think is something to be worried about as long as you believe EV's are really going to be the future. I do.
* **BLNK**'s owner and CEO Michael D Farkas sold shares last month, to the tune of 22 million dollars worth. This always makes companies look bad but many people who own and operate a business would scrape some off the top to support their family in case things don't go according to plan, not everyone is an Elon (and Elon was still set before **TSLA** lets be real), doesn't mean he is necessarily up to no good. Not to mention if shorts were attacking you with even shorter shorts every day would it not worry you a bit that they win? This is an ongoing battle for small companies that don't get along with Wall Street. Plus, he still has 6.7 million shares, he only sold about 540,000 for 22 million dollars. This is a drop in the bucket and the man should not be faulted for this, my opinion is that it is no warning sign.
* This might end up being a competitive space that could lower margins and cause financial hardships for the company. This is an actual concern. It could also take a lot longer than people are expecting to achieve meaningful penetration fully electric cars. I do think **BLNK** being poised to expand internationally will help them offset some of this.
* EV is just a bubble blah blah blah blah okay then don't buy any EV stocks, you might be right but you're also a little bitch.

**BACK TO SHORT SHORTS**

&#x200B;

So if the last data I see on yahoo says that that the float is around 27 or 28 million. This is what's not held by insiders, who are unlikely to sell right now due to the fact that everyone knows we are collectively fucking over people who traditionally fuck them over. If a few weeks ago there was 8.8 million shares shorted and the average daily trading volume as of last week close was 14,263,640. This would make it a modest  .61 days to cover. While it's no **GME**, I do believe this is a pretty large short ratio. Especially when you consider how small the public float is. I do believe this situation will be amplified the further **BLNK** moves away from it's ""valuation."" Also with what we've seen this week these people are willing to double down on things because apparently maybe they are just as retarded as we are. 

So **BLNK**'s short interest is increasing at a rate of about 20% per every 20 dollars the stock rises. This is only a simple estimate based off of quick calculations but you can see that Dec. 15 the stock price was 28 dollars and amount of shares shorted was 6.18 million. On Jan 15th  the share price was $47 and the total amount of shares sold short were 8.8 million. That's about 23%. As of right now it's still less than a day to cover but that does not mean we can't see things get frothy from this point on. Most people think **BLNK**'s chance of success sit somewhere around the 0-3% mark I'd estimate based on the general sentiment not only here on WSB but also anywhere else on the internet you look. The consensus seems to be to stay away from it.

Months back some shady research company probably wrote a hit piece on **BLNK** causing it's share price to tank nearly 50%, it had no real substance, none of the claims were found to have any evidence of being true and it is being investigated by the SEC and such, This same company ran an inaccurate hit piece on **CLSK** some time ago. Culper Research is the name if you'd like to look it up and read the hit piece. **BLNK** managed to defeat the shorts that time but will they again? 

Did I mention who else hates **BLNK** charging? **SHITRON** himself. Here's a quote from the shitman himself back in November:

Shitron said, ""**BLNK**’s valuation makes no sense"" and called the company a “total scheme.” Left said it is “insulting” to call **BLNK** an EV stock.

“New most ridiculous EV stock is $**BLNK**. No $$ for R&D, management accused of securities fraud, no real revenues,” Shitron tweeted.

This goes without saying but every word that comes out of that mans mouth is horse shit. You know this. At this point, literally the whole world knows this. It's not even a question of does he write things based off of any evidence, we all know he would only say negative things that are to cause companies to go down because he has a position shorting them. Does he still have a position? Who knows, but we can safely assume at least at one point he did.

**I try not to use the** ***F*** **word but here goes a bit of simple** ***Fundamentals*** **for you tards:**

Current market cap: **1.85b** Don't need to remind you guys this is still tiny and can still go through some explosive growth at a market cap this small in todays world with the amount of retail investors that throw their money at the most retarded shit you could ever possibly think of, for reference look at **NKLA**. Pretty sure **NKLA** reached a 20b dollar market cap at one point.

**BLNK** has negative earnings per share, and although their revenue is increasing a good amount from quarter to quarter and beating expectations they only earned about 2.26 million last quarter. 

Last quarter GAAP EPS: -.12

Operating Income: -3.50 M

Profit margin: -285.81% 

Return on Equity: -97.33% This tells you how well they are spending their money. 

Yes those are negatives. Impressive, to say the least.

As a matter of fact just about everything you read about this company screams ""***SHORT ME!***"" Think about how many rich powerful scumbags are trying to run this company into the ground. Are they right? Or is EV charging just the future that has not come yet!? What I take from this is that they are spending every dollar they have trying to make it. This is all or nothing for this company. 

**Final Thoughts**

Can we think of any other companies with negative earnings per share that still ended up being great success stories? It's almost like that hasn't been the blueprint for the past 10 years now.. Will it work? Only time will tell. But it definitely will not if these short sellers have their way with it. Also for reference just look at **QS**'s 16b dollar market cap and they don't even have a product. **BLNK** at least has products that are currently going out into the world to be used. Of course the real move could just be puts on **QS,** but I stay out of bear territory especially during bull feeding frenzies. My outlook is that Billions are just the Millions of some years ago, especially when we're printing Trillions out of thin air (Obligatory shout out to the printer man himself **JPOW**). Just remember that we live in a brave new world where kids with phone apps can invest in what they believe the future is going to look like.

Lastly, this is a stock no one has restricted trading to yet, allowing people to buy more than 2-3 shares could seriously cause **BLNK** to quadruple in value. We've seen how fast small market cap companies can jump when millions of autists all buy shares at the same time. Strength in numbers. The revolution of the retail investor has only begun my friends.

Remember I'm just a retard not a financial advisor so this is not advice or anything but I'll let my positions speak for themselves:

**GME** 500 c jan 29 (RIP I TRIED TO IGNITE THE INFINITE GAMMA SQUEEZE GUYS, I DID MY PART AND BOUGHT THAT SHIT ON THURSDAY, GUESSING IF 500C WENT IN THE MONEY IT WAS GOING TO IGNITE A DOMINO EFFECT, I TRIED AND FAILED BUT I LOVE YOU ALL, BUYING MORE SHARES ON MONDAY)

TLDR: **BLNK** is the only vertically integrated EV charging company, **BLNK** has international presence, **BLNK** shares are up 2400% in the past year. It will take .61 days to cover and this number DEFINITELY rising, very small amount of float available, Shitron hates **BLNK**, so do all other short sellers, make no mistake they have put the hit out on **BLNK** and would love to see it run into the ground, **BLNK** is small enough to still rocketship pretty hard, **GME** to the moon."|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|['BLNK', 'DD']|[]|['I', 'EXTRA', 'GME', 'GME', 'BLNK', 'I', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'TTING', 'TSELF', 'UP', 'I', 'EV', 'BLNK', 'CALLY', 'AGE', 'OF', 'LEAPS', 'AFTER', 'THE', 'OCKUP', 'BLNK', 'LA', 'EV', 'EV', 'EV', 'I', 'USA', 'W', 'DC', 'I', 'DC', 'DCFC', 'W', 'DC', 'DC', 'AC', 'AC', 'DC', 'I', 'TICAL', 'I', 'EV', 'I', 'IQ', 'IQ', 'EV', 'EV', 'I', 'I', 'IQ', 'EV', 'I', 'USA', 'EV', 'I', 'I', 'CEO', 'D', 'I', 'EV', 'EV', 'BACK', 'TO', 'SHORT', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'WSB', 'SEC', 'I', 'EV', 'EV', 'D', 'I', 'GAAP', 'M', 'SHORT', 'ME', 'EV', 'I', 'QS', 'I', 'RIP', 'I', 'TRIED', 'TO', 'GNITE', 'THE', 'INITE', 'GAMMA', 'UEEZE', 'GUYS', 'I', 'DID', 'MY', 'PART', 'AND', 'OUGHT', 'THAT', 'SHIT', 'ON', 'RSDAY', 'SSING', 'IF', 'C', 'WENT', 'IN', 'THE', 'MONEY', 'IT', 'WAS', 'GOING', 'TO', 'GNITE', 'A', 'OMINO', 'FFECT', 'I', 'TRIED', 'AND', 'AILED', 'BUT', 'I', 'LOVE', 'YOU', 'ALL', 'UYING', 'MORE', 'HARES', 'ON', 'EV', 'ITELY']|['GME', 'GME']

If you are absolutely  new to stocks and options, you should start with likes of Investopedia  to learn basic mechanics and greeks. This post will focus on a little  less obvious things.

**1) I sold options and they became In the money. When will I get assigned?**

Technically,  you can get assigned at any moment since you’ve sold it. But if there  is any extrinsic value of an option contract (if your option is trading  higher than the difference between the strike price and the current  market price of a stock) it will almost never be exercised before  expiry. Watch out for these two events, though: hostile takeovers and  dividend trigger (if the dividend payed is higher than extrinsic value).  Well, also watch out for drunk idiots who exercise by mistake.

**2) It’s expiry day. At what time will I get assigned?**

Most  often Option Clearing Corporation will trigger automatic assignment of  any ITM options, unless other is configured by the client in his  brokerage. The default automatic exercises and assignments processing  time is 16:00 pm Eastern Time. However, the OCC permits client manual  exercise decisions for until 17:30 EST.

**3) At 16:00 my sold options have expired worthless. Am I good?**

No,  as mentioned above – if the price in after hours moves and makes your  options ITM, they can still be assigned until 17:30. Especially be  cautious in the days of earnings or days when 13F are published —  those  can move asset prices after hours quite a bit.

**4) Can I buy or sell options before/after hours?**

No,  generally you can’t. The exceptions are very select instruments. Also,  some brokers offer exclusive packages and allow you to trade options  outside regular hours, but you will be, basically, trading with the  broker himself.

**5) How options and stocks are taxed if I exercise or get assigned?**

Options  premiums are added or subtracted to/from the base price of the stock.  Say, you bought calls strike price 100, for 10$ premium. On the day of  expiry the price of your stock has gone up to 200, Your calls are now  worth 100$, but you still believe that the stock price can go even  higher, you would prefer to own and hold that stock. You can sell those  call contracts and be taxed for profits of 90$ per contract. But if you  exercise your contracts, your base price will be 110$ per contract and  your profit will be your future sale price minus 110$. Works in a  similar way with puts, and short positions in options.

*Disclaimer*: this might not be accurate for all jurisdictions and accounts. This is not an accounting advise, please contact professionals!

**6) Why my options are losing value even though the underlying stock went in my direction (up for calls, down for puts)?**

Options  prices are more complex than simply tracking the performance of a  stock. Again, it is useful to learn the greeks. But to start, you should  understand two most useful aspects: time decay and Implied Volatility.  If you have short term expiring Out of the money options, their price  will decline even if the price of a stock goes in your direction, but  not fast enough.

Implied  Volatility can be described as market sentiment and expectancy of price  changes. The higher is the belief that the price will change – the more  expensive are the options (especially with low delta). For example, If  you bought calls after 3 days of insane volatility, but then the next  weeks it moved up for only 1 or 2%, your calls will likely not gain, but  rather lose value, because you bough them at the peak of IV, and since  the volatility seemingly settled down, the market no longer expects huge  moves and is no longer eager to pay big premium for your options.

There  can be also so-called unusual activity. That’s basically large amounts  of purchases of some particular options outstanding against the general  flow. Those events can change premiums for a period of time too and  often indicate a start of a new trend.

**7) Can I do a Poor Man Covered Call on a cash account?**

Poor  Man Covered Call is a strategy of selling OTM calls but having a deep  ITM call as a hedge. It imitates covered calls strategy. Some people  assume, that since this strategy caps your downside risk, this will be  allowed on a cash account. This is false. Cash accounts allow no naked  options selling, even if your max loss is caped.

**8) What is Settled cash and Free Riding Rule?**

Most  trades have settling periods. For stocks it is T+2 (the day you traded +  2 business days) and for most options it’s the next day. This means,  that if you sold something, the cash is not immediately delivered to  your account. Brokers will still allow you to buy with unsettled cash.  This is called Free Riding. But if you sell anything you bought with  unsettled cash — they will give you a 90 days restriction for violation  of Free Riding Rule. This is very uncomfortable.

This applies only to cash accounts.

**9) If I added to a position under Free Riding Rule, can I still sell if I’m within limits of what I bought before?**

No.  For example, if you had 100 shares for a long time, but bought 10 more  shares under Free Riding, even if you then sell only 1 share before cash  is settled, you will still get a 90 day restriction. At least on most  brokers that I know.

**10) Can I sell covered calls when I have 0$ settled cash on cash account?**

Not  on all brokers. Some brokers will treat selling covered calls as if you  are using formal 0% margin. And since you have 0$ settled cash, your  cash doesn’t exceed your 0% margin. Sounds moronic, but that’s how it  works. You might be caught in this situation if you are rolling covered  calls on a cash account: you buyback those contracts, get bellow your  settled cash and then can’t sell new covered calls until next business  day.

**11) How to save on commissions if I’m not using a commission-free broker?**

Some  brokers allow you to configure your orders with numerous options. First  of all, don’t use their smart algorithms or any kinds of quirky  ‘special sauces’ - 9 times out of 10 you will get both worse execution  and bigger commissions. Secondly, if configurable, always ask for an  All-or-None orders.  This will ensure that your order will be much more  likely filled from one source and on one exchange, thus minimizing your  commission. Finally, there are exchanges that offer traders rebates for  added liquidity. For example NYSE Arca (PSE) and BATS offer rebates to  customers for added liquidity in options trading. Yes, you will get a  cashback for your trades. Configure destination of your orders to select  those exchanges. Note: some brokers will provide those rebates to their  users and some will just take it themselves. Note 2: rebates are  offered for adding liquidity; for removing liquidity you will still get  charged.

Hope this helps! Feel free to write your questions if you have some. And good luck with your trades!"|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'ITM', 'OCC', 'EST', 'I', 'ITM', 'F', 'I', 'I', 'IV', 'I', 'OTM', 'ITM', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'NYSE', 'BATS']|[]

I've been doing a lot of research and thinking today about where we're at right now and where do we go from here and I wanted to get it all written out for my own sake but I also might as well share with you guys.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Let me start off by saying that I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I an expert but I do follow the markets closely and I do listen to the experts.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I believe that due to a number of factors that I will outline in this post that we could see a liquidity crisis in the next 1-4 weeks. Now before you start calling me a gay bear please hear me out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As you retards have been yolo'ing FD's this has gamma squoze the shit out of the market. This is great until the market rolls over and the same dynamic goes against you. When prices go down, the MM's sell the shares they were using as a delta hedge and that makes prices go down faster.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What happened this week with RH and others halting trading on the meme names was a liquidity issue. RH drew down their $500M credit line and borrowed another $1B last week to try and keep up with you guys! Massive call buying causes the VIX to go up. VIX going up means the hedge funds, clearing houses and brokerage firms aren't allowed to operate on as much leverage. Low VIX = Leverage good, High Vix = Leverage Bad. If the VIX stays up all of these entities are going to have to sell off their positions to meet their collateral requirements. GME has more shares short than actually exist so if enough autist hold then they will never be able to fully cover. What happens then?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

High VIX means everybody needs to deleverage their positions which means stonks go down :(

There is a pending liquidity problem here. If you look at the chart of GDX for example you will see it always seems to diverge downward from SPY whenever there is a pending liquidity event. In general you would expect to see the TLT go up when the VIX goes up. More volatility means you want to flee to the safety of bonds right? Instead what we're seeing is TLT down while VIX is up. It's my view that TLT will come up and join the VIX very shortly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now I'd like to point out that I'm not a gay bear, I'm a bull at heart. The thing is that if we can be prepared for the crash that's coming we can BTFD so hard. If we have nothing at the bottom then there is no money to BTFD!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

On Friday we saw stocks sell off to their weekly lows,  the VIX was quite high and bond yields were at their all time low. Low bond yields means people are not hedging their portfolios and / or they're selling bonds to cover their margin requirements. The hedge funds are now concerned that if the market continues to go down they will need to start to deleverage. There is more margin and call options out there right now than there has ever been. This is where that reverse gamma squeeze screws you over. This could cause a fast, sharp move lower. Think March 2020.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In the treasury market last week the short term treasury yields fell to all time lows. Short interest for everyday stocks are at alltime lows. Put option volumes are at all time lows. As prices start going down, market participants realize they need to hedge their bets and so they buy puts. MM's short the stock in order to hedge their put sale and this is where the gamma squeeze to the downside exacerbates the move downward.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even mutual funds are record long equity and record underweight bonds. As the market rolls over they will also need to sell equities to get into fixed income.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If you look at the SPY yearly chart there is bearish divergence over the past 2 months. What does that mean? RSI has been trending downwards will price has been continuing upwards. This is an indicator of a market trend reversal. The DMARK is also hitting daily, weekly, monthly and yearly high. This is very bearish as well. These signals don't necessarily mean that something that will for sure happen but it is pointing out that there is tons of risk in the system.

&#x200B;

Now look at the Covid situation throughout the world. It is calming down somewhat but the problem is we're seeing new fast spreading strains of the virus that could easily turn the situation for the worse very quickly. This could lead to more shut downs which effects the economy and the market. So this begs the question, are all of these companies optimistic reflation projections realistic? What happens if / when they miss earning estimates?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So what do we do about this? First and foremost HOLD YOUR GME, AMC + BB shares. They might be the only stonks that goes up this week / month. Assuming you're not all in on GME, what do you do with your other money? Spy puts, TLT calls and Gold are where you want to be if you buy my idea that this could be March 2020 all over again.  I know these are all gay bear moves. Feel free to disagree with me in the comments!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Be careful out there guys!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** The market looks quite risky right now for a number of reasons. Could potentially be like last March. Hold your GME shares, hedge the crash with everything else.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Positions: GME Shares + SLV Calls + Cash, buying TLT Calls and Spy puts tomorrow.

This report will discuss the current and future state of Blackberry Ltd (“**Blackberry**”) and its business viability. Too long has the cycle of research been held in the hands of big banks that are incentivized to publish aggressive price targets at the point of a transaction. Too long have buy-side institutions been caged inside an investment parameter that is geared towards accumulating capital than growing it.

We will be discussing Blackberry’s product suite and its defensibility in their respective ecosystems, what value Blackberry brings to the world and various valuation metrics to justify a price target of over CAD$100.

The Blackberry product suite is largely deployed in hi-tech environments with sophisticated buyers seeking the highest security uncompromising in the sight of an indelicate user interface. This includes both its cybersecurity and QNX platforms.

QNX is vital to the self-driving ecosystem and will be the de-facto operating system at the point of multiple catalysts. This includes the first approved autopilot system in any jurisdiction, the first cybersecurity attack on a connected vehicle non QNX related and diamond handed people in WSB.

**ALL WE NEEDED TO KEEP TRADING WAS AN INFUSION OF $7.5B!!!!!!!**

But, u/clash_jeremy, that's so much money! NO IT ISN'T. The US Government ran a deficit of **$3.1T** last year to keep the whole system going. The Fed added close to **$3T** to their asset sheets to keep the whole system going. So, when it came time to keep the system going for the retail investor, **THEY LOOKED THE OTHER WAY!!!!!**

One of the main duties of the Fed and Treasury is to ensure liquidity in all markets. THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT WE NEEDED WEDNESDAY-FRIDAY of last week.

But, what if they didn't know this was coming. Yeah, convenient alibi if the CEO for DTCC wasn't literally an advisor for the Federal Reserve and the FDIC!

**TLDR = HOLD GME for as long as you can this DD is for AFTER the squeeze, once out get your money into PUTS.**

I wanted to bring you some DD that I have been working on but first let me get something out of the way.  I am tired of all the stock talk and we need to get back to some old school DD so we know where to YOLO our GME returns AND talk about options again.  I do not recommend getting out GME for any reason for the below.  This is what I think is occurring now and over the next few months, or faster, pending the severity of the situation.  If the situation is as severe as u/johnnydaggers & u/vinlo make it look then this could happen A LOT faster.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀GME TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

The unfortunate part is I am a bull by nature, always have been.  This write-up is extremely bearish in nature but before calling me a 🏳️‍🌈🐻it is only because of the unique situation us glorious folk has put us in with uncovering a massive issue with the market.

What is going on now is starting to look a lot like 2008/09.  I believe that the HF's got caught so bad with their naked short selling that there is literally no way to unwind the damage that they are doing.  For some reference PLEASE read this post as I believe this is the catalyst to what I am posting below.  I was missing a piece but tonight I believe I found it:

[u/johnnydaggers & u/vinlo naked short selling write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9jbc5/listen_to_me_we_cannot_trust_the_short_interest/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I started looking at the 08/09 housing crash and then it hit me that the VW squeeze was also occurring around this time.  So what I wanted to see was how much liquidity came out of the market between the squeeze and the housing crisis.  **Can you believe the VW squeeze dropped the market more than the housing crisis?**  The below SPY chart goes from 7/1/2008 to somewhere mid-April.

* You can see that just after the squeeze started the entire market started to dump.  This most likely had to with liquidity and all the same issues we are seeing now
* The VW squeeze dropped the SPY 37% in about 6 weeks
* There was then a 26% rebound during the **peak** of the short squeeze - This tells me the people that were screwed in this one were consolidating liquidity and once they had an idea of what was going on moved into buying calls prior to shorting the market and exacerbating the housing collapse.
* The entire market was still trending down after this rebound until the lowest of lows of the housing market crash

Here is what piqued my interest.  The VW squeeze dropped the SPY **37%** from beginning to end, and the entire housing crisis dropped SPY **28%**?  **HOW IS THIS EVEN REMOTELY POSSIBLE?**

[I eat chalk, not crayons, they taste better.](https://preview.redd.it/4gzqdeml6re61.png?width=1478&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf799e7b86ec26b0b6afcefdf241cb1b48131306)

So I take this info and now look at the current SPY chart and see what GME is doing to the overall market.  This is where we are now:

If we apply some basic math the correct on the market could be somewhere in the 240s.  Yes, I know how crazy that sounds but I believe this to be the beginning of the bubble popping.  We exposed a HUGE crack in the foundation and I think it is only going to get worse especially if any of the additional data provided above is accurate.  If it is then we could be looking at a correction closer to the 45% overall range in the next 6-9 months.

My plays:

GME TO THE MOON - Mix of options and shares and riding this into VALHALLA

As for the bullshit above I am going to be going with:

315P (4-6 Weeks out)

200/250p range or both EOY

I am not a financial advisor, I don't know anything about anything.  I like stonks like GME and this is my very biased mostly retarded fully autistic opinion.

I have been around WSB for years under this username and my other, less anonymous one. Check my other posts to confirm I am not hedgie agent scum.

Now, to the unpopular part: a word of caution. I see a lot of DD around here analyzing the short interest, the $GME public float, and theories about what that means for the trading price of the stock. Yes, we like the stock. HOWEVER, all of this DD fails to consider one very important variable – the authorized but unissued shares of $GME.

If you look at $GME’s articles of incorporation (this is the document that gives a company its corporate existence and, among other things, states the number of shares the company is authorized to issue), you will see that $GME is authorized to issue up to 300,000,000 shares. Currently it looks like there are about 70,000,000 shares outstanding depending on whose number you go with. So, theoretically, the board of directors of $GME could issue three times the number of shares that are currently outstanding today.

Is the board going to do that? Your guess is as good as mine. On one hand, the board is certainly not going to go out of their way to help out a bunch of hedge funds that were trying to total screw them over and drive them into the ground. But on the other hand, the board has a fiduciary obligation to act in the best interests of the shareholders of the company. If they can raise a bunch of money selling stock at a $300+ price level, they have to legally consider it. This could significantly improve their balance sheet by allowing them to take out debt with the cash proceeds from a very rich equity sale.

So, could they easily issue more shares? The answer is yes. In December, the company filed an automatic shelf registration statement. This allows them to, essentially at any time and very quickly register a follow-on public equity sale. You can bet your ass that these shorts have been making calls into the company to see what the appetite would be in taking this route, which could allow them to get out of their positions for substantially less than would be the case if they had to cover in the secondary market (because, diamond hands, of course).

Now a couple of good things, even if the board wanted to do this, it seems very risky for all concerned. I think we all know that after the squeeze is done, hitting whatever price it is going to hit ($1,000, $10,000, $42,069???), eventually the price is going to come back to land (could be a week, a month, a year, who knows). When that happens, selling stock at a hugely inflated value based on earning performance (note that I have argued the price today of $GME is totally supported for economic reasons) is going to invite lawsuits galore, so perhaps the board (Which is risk averse by nature) doesn’t want to make a move without letting things settle out. Time will tell. Also, all of this free press has to be a boon for business and I have to believe that the board sees what happened with Robinhood (aka Robbin’ Gainz) where they totally disenfranchised their whole user base in a single day and saw the valuable lesson there. Thus, this is another reason that the $GME board probably won’t issue more shares to screw over the WSB investors, many of whom are their target market.

All that said, I want to see the $GME rocket broaching interstellar space like the rest of you MONKEs.🦍🍌🚀🌖🌖🌖🌖

Also, need to give some love to the rest of the $BANG stocks, $BB, $AMC, and $NOK. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Let’s hope the $GME board also has diamond hands and lets this ship fly!!!!!
💎👋🚀🌖

Edit 1: Tl;dr I predict 💎👋🦍🍌🚀🚀🚀🚀🌖, but there is a risk that the company refuels our ship prematurely.

Edit 2: I will qualify my comments by acknowledging the fact that the NYSE does have a “20% Rule” which generally requires shareholder approval for a NYSE-listed company from issuing more than 20% of its outstanding, so that is a real constrain as well.

**ADM and Future for Sustainable Agriculture and Cost Reduction**

Ok, supposedly everyone cares about sustainable business models and the environment nowadays. Which they should. But sometimes it is a little more complicated than just buying an electric vehicle. Food production is a massive contributor to global CO2 emissions. See: [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507104446.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507104446.htm) (TLDR: Soybean trade is bad for the environment.)

Soybean and Corn is currently processed for animal feed. But guess what, you can create animal feed with minimal land, space and water. How? The answer is insect protein.

Insect Protein Animal Feed Industry

Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and InnovaFeed plan to begin building what will be the world’s largest insect protein facility in 2021 in the city of Decatur in central Illinois.

PROS:

\- Black soldier fly larvae eat non-compostable food waste bound for landfills + produce hundreds of times more protein per acre than traditional animal feed sources. This will be attractive to the public with the growing consciousness of environmental sustainability.

\- Current animal feed is sourced from soybean meal and corn meal. The massive quantities of corn and soybean farming requires large amounts of land and water. Insects can be grown indoors, requiring far less land and water.

\- **Not only does the farming of insects decrease CO2 emissions in itself, these insects eat and feed on WASTE. This food processing decreases CO2 emissions AND reduces landfill waste.**

CONS:

\- Insect food processing is still not cost competitive with traditional animal feed; however, innovation and sustainability always comes with a cost.

# TLDR

\- ADM is currently holding 10% less market cap while trading at a lower P/E and P/S. (Compared to CTVA, it's biggest competitor.)

\- ADM provides 2x the annual dividend (Compared to CTVA, its biggest competitor.) AKA BOOMERS LIKE DIS STOCK TOO.

\- ADM shows consistent (although slow) year over year growth. Current financials do not project ADM to be a growth stock. I believe this what causes it to trade at such a low price to earnings ratio (50% lower than market average); however, I believe their initiative for a more sustainable business model will change this in the long term.

\- Insect farming reduces required land and water. You can literally raise these in a small indoor facility anywhere in the world...or even the moon 🚀 🚀 . Insect farming has potential to be much cheaper than current business models. Insect farming reduces CO2 emissions and they feed for landfill waste. You can grow feed for livestock while reducing the amount of landfill waste AND reducing CO2 emissions.

Positions: I am only holding shares at the moment. As we are seeing a current market pull back, I will most likely enter LEAPS 1/20/2023 $55C. This allows time for the insect protein segment to develop. Who knows, maybe they can even get government tax incentives for this sustainable initiative. 🚀 🚀

## What Exactly Happened at Robinhood This Week?

There has been plenty of speculation this week about what exactly went down and unverified (although reasonable) rumors on why Robinhood did this. I’ll go over the top two theories before taking a deep dive into the “official” reason given by Robinhood.

[**Pressure from the White House and Sequoia according to a Robinhood employee**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/l723kf/robinhood_insider_information/)

This statement has been [refuted by Sequoia](https://www.newsweek.com/sequoia-capitol-denies-pressuring-robinhood-stop-gamestop-trading-after-viral-reddit-post-1565269). I personally wouldn’t believe the Sequoia part since I don’t really know what they would gain from it - they’re a Venture Capital firm, not a hedge fund, and would not be actively shorting stocks let alone be trading in stocks. It could be possible that the White House, or someone from the government did contact Robinhood - actually, I’d be pretty shocked if no one called them at some point this week to ask wtf was going on.During this call, they may have been afraid that GameStop’s short squeeze would have triggered a major financial crisis due to hedge funds collapsing and de-grossing, causing a mass selloff similar to what was seen in 2008 and in March 2020 - I’ll talk more about this later. Basically, without Robinhood shutting down GME from being bought, it’s actually very possible we would have seen the rest of the stock market collapse last week, and this was something the Biden administration was trying to make sure didn’t happen in the first month in office.

**Possible intervention from Citadel Securities**

This was a theory I personally believed in initially and would have been a very obvious area of scrutiny for many people. The most straightforward one being the fact that Citadel (the hedge fund) dumped a few billion into Melvin to bail it out a [few days ago](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340), who were the very well known shorts of GME. Citadel, the hedge fund, is owned by Citadel LLC, which happens to also run Citadel Securities - a market maker. If you don’t know what this is, go grow a few brain wrinkles and read my [previous post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ygab/dddd_how_rwallstreetbets_created_a_financial/). Citadel Securities is effectively Robinhood’s sugar daddy, directly being responsible for around [40% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/a-controversial-part-of-robinhoods-business-tripled-in-sales-thanks-to-high-frequency-trading-firms.html) in 2018 through their payment for order flow (i.e. selling your trades to Citadel, giving them the right of first refusal, and [potentially giving you a worse price](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321); this is how they get 0% commission trades btw).

Theoretically, Citadel the hedge fund and Citadel the market maker is run independently and sister companies both owned by Citadel LLC, but anyone can see this being a potential conflict of interest. There’s also a possibility that Citadel Securities losing billions of dollars being short so many GME calls (they write 99% of all options contracts) and probably not being perfectly Gamma and (especially) Vega hedged, so when those two greeks skyrocketed on GME they probably lost tons of money there. [According to WSB hero Chamath](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354947541125611526), he didn’t invest in Robinhood when they came to him on multiple occasions because he thought the founders lacked integrity, implying he believes they might have been the type of people to sell out their users (granted, they already literally do this) and do this type of shit.

**The Official Reason - Clearing House Limitations**

Let’s get to the [official reason put out by Robinhood](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility), which is that their clearing house, in this case the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, suddenly increased their collateral requirements on GME trades drastically. Apparently, **Robinhood is running out of cash**, so they weren’t able to provide the cash collateral demanded by DTCC, and hence weren’t able to trade through them. Let’s dumb this down and talk about how brokerages work.

Let’s talk about what a clearing house is and how they work. Imagine Bob wants to sell Dylan a share of GME. There’s a bunch of legal paperwork and logistics for actually transferring over the share, which can take a few days to finalize - this is called settlement. However, you don’t want people being able to back out of this exchange during this process for obvious reasons, so that’s where the clearing house comes in. Let’s call this clearing house Mary. What Mary does is facilitate (clear) this exchange, and ensures both Bob and Dylan follow through with their trade by having them both immediately give Mary cash as collateral while the exchange settles. If one party was no longer able to meet their end of the exchange (eg. Dylan goes bankrupt), Mary acts as an insurer and is responsible for buying the share from Bob instead. If it turned out that Bob was lying about actually owning a share and can't transfer it over to Dylan in time (failure to deliver), Mary is responsible for finding that share for him instead.

Since GME suddenly became very volatile, and the financial soundness of some parties and their ability to deliver their side of the trade have been suddenly called into question ([at least on the seller’s side](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)), DTCC decided  (...or due to pressure from other sources?) to increase the collateral needed for buying GME to be more than 10x of the proportion of the market value of whatever it was before. Most brokerages reacted to this by disabling margin trading. For some reason, Robinhood went one step further and disabled trading for all accounts, possibly due to their relatively small cash reserves compared to places like Fidelity, and the relatively large number of users who use margin in the platform.

## What’s Robinhood Going To Do About GME?

Robinhood’s decision to stop purchases of GME basically got hate from literally everyone, to the point where it somehow united the country in a beautiful way. Here’s a list of things that happened as a result of Robinhood’s decision, for fun

* [Ted Cruz retweeted AOC saying he completely agreed with her](https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905)
* [Protests at NYSE and Robinhood HQ](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/protesters-gather-at-robinhood-hq-nyse-in-response-to-restricted-stock-trades)
* [Class action lawsuit](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/investing/lawsuit-robinhood-gamestop-wallstreetbets/index.html)
* [Someone paid to have an airplane](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rlyx/this_guy_is_flying_a_banner_saying_suck_my_nuts/) fly around the Bay Area over Robinhood’s office saying “Suck my nuts Robinhood”
* [Angry Robinhood employees were given DoorDash credits for some reason?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7y5ka/robinhood_staff_unhappy_about_the_trading_hault/)
* [Congressional investigation to Robinhood’s decision](https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-job-posting-federal-affairs-congress-hearing-gamestop-reddit-2021-1)
* [SEC investigation to Robinhood’s decision](https://www.cnet.com/news/robinhood-troubles-sec-will-closely-review-actions-that-restricted-amc-gamestop-stock-trades/)

Clearly, this decision has single-handedly made Robinhood the most hated company in the world right now. It’s especially bad given the optics - their mission is to literally “democratize finance”, with the idea of empowering individual retail investors to be on the same level of institutions. This decision, whether intentional or not, has literally gone against everything about Robinhood’s image and mission, and will end the company if not fixed soon. **All of this right as Robinhood is planning to launch their IPO**.

The people in charge of Robinhood likely know all of this and are doing everything they can to find cash and liquidity to put up the collateral needed to resume GME trading. So far we’ve seen them raise $1B from investors and $500M through lines of credit overnight, although based on the fact that GME is still restricted, that doesn’t seem to be enough. However, in my personal opinion, I think it's likely that Robinhood is doing everything they can to find more money given the situation, and once they do, **they will likely re-enable trading on GME. If that happens (which IMO will probably be some time next week), GME and all other high-SI stocks will absolutely** 🚀🌝\*\*.\*\*

## How GME Almost Caused (and Still Can Cause) a Stock Market Crash

Let’s go over something else interesting that went on as a result of the GME short squeeze - the fact that it started to affect the stock market overall. In fact, the stock market had the largest decline since October across all sectors on Wednesday when GME, AMC, and other high-SI stocks surged, with a very sharp recovery as the meme stocks fell after Robinhood suspending purchases; this was one of the biggest de-grossing of hedge funds in history. [Chamath wrote a great Twitter thread about this](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354883147523997697), so amazing that I’ll just copy-paste his tweets rather than try to explain it better myself.

>*1. If you are ""smart money"" you are allowed to take your $1 and leverage it up to $15+*  
>  
>*2. You can now buy $15 of stock AND if you promise to short companies, you can short $15 of stock as well*

[Hedge fund grossing \/ de-grossing](https://preview.redd.it/c5we1d7e0se61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a11131168d69e5f3aea93c8fd087a1478500ddc)

In other words, as stocks like GME go up, the highly-leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts. Most retail investors are limited to 2x leverage, but since hedge funds are “hedged” by taking short and long positions, they can be up to 30x levered since theoretically they would be shielded from external events that cause all stocks to go up or down in price (i.e. Beta neutral), so they’re “safer”. To get out of these short positions, they will need to massively unwind their long positions as well so they can still have a reasonable “Net Exposure”, triggering a sell-off in those stocks.

A very similar thing actually happened in March (with risk-parity) causing hedge funds to similarly massively de-gross, and literally everything from GLD to even AMZN’s stock price dropping as a result, even though theoretically COVID-19 would’ve been good for both from a fundamental basis, as we saw later on. It’s very likely that if Robinhood hadn’t stopped purchases of GME, many more hedge funds shorts would have had their shorts blow up and be forced to continue to de-gross causing a widespread stock market crash, potentially being the catalyst for finally popping the [decade-long liquidity (leverage)-fueled asset bubble we’ve been experiencing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) In fact, this could still happen since it doesn’t look like hedge funds have learned their lesson and **are still heavily short GME with Net Shares Shorts barely moving this week** [**according to S3 Partners**](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355225495835709441)**.** Furthermore, despite seeing the largest de-grossing of hedge funds since 2009, **gross exposure (aka leverage) of hedge funds still remains** [**close to record-high levels**](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-hedgefunds/goldman-sees-hedge-fund-exposures-close-to-records-ongoing-sell-off-risk-after-gamestop-swings-idUSL1N2K60GW).

**TLDR**

In case your attention span was too short to read everything above,

1. Robinhood is going to be doing everything they can to raise cash to resume GME purchases, when this happen GME 🚀🌝
2. Much of the stock market’s value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so **if GME (and other common shorts) 🚀🌝 the rest of the stock market might collapse around it (EDIT - as hedge funds re-consider their long / short strategy), triggering a financial crisis**

*Now, just to be clear, buying GME right now is joining a game of hot potato; the longer you hold the potato the more tendies you get to eat for dinner, but at some point this will all blow up and when it does someone will be the bagholder - and right now everyone is rooting for these bagholders to be the hedge funds that are short GME. That being said, with Short Interest barely moving this week, this day of reckoning doesn’t look like it’ll be coming in the next few days and for reasons mentioned above, it’s probably more likely for GME to reach $1K next week than the probability that it’ll fall below $100.*

Or in other words, [I like these stocks](https://www.highshortinterest.com/).

EDIT - Appearently S3 Partners just contradicted [their tweet on Friday](https://s3partners.com/Exclusive.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=announcement&utm_campaign=10ds) and now indicate that shares short of GME have dipped below 30M shares. Still highly shorted compared to most other stocks, fwiw.

EDIT2 - Getting alot of questions on how one short position in a small cap can do this, and my answer is that GME alone wouldn't cause a financial crisis, but rather what GME represents, which is disproving that hedge funds that a long / short strategy (i.e. taking out additional leverage to short similar companies they long) is unviable; The word from my hedge fund friends is that this type of thing would have been considered a six-sigma event, or one in a billion chance of happening; which is obviously no longer true. Hedge funds seeing Melvin go down will probably start re-consider their short books. This on mass will cause a mass short-covering and also sell-off of their longs.

I know this sub is getting absolutely bombarded with random hot takes and DD’s, but I’m hoping this might be an analogy that helps a lot of people understand GME and the squeeze that’s happening, and will be unique enough to stay. 


If you’re still struggling to understand the squeeze, shorting and the $GME trends, I’m here to help. Bear with me. (No, not that bear). 

This is gonna be really oversimplified, but be different than 🦍 and 🍌.

So, imagine a college star, up and coming high draft pick. Most sports are apt for this analogy, but NFL works best. 


This is a QB projected #1 pre-season. He’s legit. bona-fide, undeniable talent. Let’s call him Game Stop, (Stop, #69). 

He’s on a shit team and gets dealt a shit hand for 2020 (bad team + pandemic. Limits games played, falling off the radar). 

Now let’s a few things happen: 

1.) Someone makes a massive bet that Game Stop is washed, terrible and will never recover, but they have to borrow money to make that bet. They hate the player because they’re old and resentful and afraid of death, and they want to do everything they can to prevent this young player from succeeding. They want to force them to fail by making everyone else believe they will fail. 

2.) A new head coach gets hired, someone who is absolutely qualified and primed to bring out the absolute best in Game Stop, and revolutionize and evolve their game. 

3.) A random dude on the internet notices how high the bet is against the player, Game Stop. They think to themselves, “Hey, I’ve seen that dude play. His talent is undeniable, and he’s got the perfect new coach. There is no WAY he’s gonna be that bad”. 

4.) This dude let’s his buddies know about how high the bet against the player, Game Stop, is, and they agree. There is no WAY they’re that bad, especially with the new coach! There’s no way this bet can win, this is easy money!

5.) Word about the bet spreads like wildfire. Not only do more and more people do their research and watch game tape and realize how talented the player is, they realize how insane the bet against him is. 

Now, Game Stop (#69) starts to get back on track. They start playing games again and show their potential, their talent. They’re making a playoff run. Now they’re gaining more and more attention, and MORE people realize they’re gonna succeed. 

The original person who bet against the player, who was convinced they were washed, starts to panic. The person they borrowed the money from is starting to see what’s going on, and starts to ask for the money back. Every game that Game Stop plays, they prove themselves more and more, and the bet against them gets even more spicy. At this point, the bettor borrows even more money and DOUBLES DOWN, stubborn and convinced the player will fail and prove they were right. 

People aren’t having it. They’ve SEEN the games, they KNOW the talent, there is absolutely no way this player isn’t legit, no possible way for them to fail. They bet even more in support. They KNOW he’ll succeed, make the playoffs and win the championship and be the #1 pick. 

At this point, the person who bet against him is losing an insane amount of money. There is no way they can pay back the original bet. They’ll be absolutely ruined and embarrassed. Somehow, they have enough power to stop the player from playing games. They take the games off TV, they  delete the highlight videos, they go to the news screaming “This player is terrible. Trash, washed. Anyone who doesn’t believe that is delusional, wrong, and will lose a lot of money”. 
It doesn’t matter, everyone has already seen the games, the highlights, the talent, with their OWN EYES. It’s undeniable. The bet is terrible, and the new coach fits perfectly. 

Every single day the bettor doesn’t cut his losses, the person he borrowed from adds interest to the total they owe. They’re getting impatient and they see the writing on the wall. BUT, if they wanna continue, that’s fine, the bettor will just have to pay even more money at the end.


That’s where we’re at now. Exactly that. 

All it comes down to now, is all of us believing what we’ve already known, what we’ve already seen. They can take down the videos, they can blackout the media, they can keep them from even playing a game, but it’s too late. WE’VE SEEN IT. WE KNOW. WE KNOW THE TALENT, THE COACH, AND HOW BAD THE BET IS. 

All we have to do is believe in ourselves, and trust in the talent we’ve seen, and stick to our guns about how terrible the bet against the player was. Every moment that goes by, every game they play, the bet gets worse, and our position gets better. 

No matter what, the original better has to call it quits and take their losses, but they will do EVERYTHING they can to make us stumble, falter, fear. To make us doubt ourselves and what we’ve seen, what we know. They can’t. 


We watched this player in elementary school, in middle school, in high school, and college. They brought us countless moments of joy, and sometimes of sadness. We lost with them, but more importantly, we WON with them. How fucking DARE someone bet against them and their talent, and intentionally try to ruin their career, just out of spite, to make a profit. 

We know this player, we trust this player, we like this player, we believe in this player, and if we hold this player, by fucking God this player and everyone who believed in them, will win. We’ll succeed. 

And that son of a bitch who tried to ruin them? They lose everything.

Hello silver surfers, clang gang, and monkeys who enjoy shiny things

Thank you for helping [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the_real_dd_on_slv_the_worlds_biggest_short/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) go viral and make it on Zerohedge (dreams fulfilled).

Before I get GME hate mail, let me clarify I am still long GME and am looking for the moon in GME.  I also have a small long silver position.  Both positions are quite small as I am unfortunately not super well capitalized.  Many of the comments about buys on the previous post referenced order sizes I can only dream of at the moment, but I'm damn glad we have so much conviction behind this trade.

I created an official [Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/Thehappyhawaii1/status/1355663208774836228?s=20). Not sure if I’ll use it, but didn’t want anyone to impersonate me.

Clang gang acted so fast, that all the bullion dealers sold out over the weekend which is incredible, and overnight futures are spiking as we speak.  I continue to support the purchase of physical silver as a way to continue the short squeeze if you can find any of course.  The short squeeze thesis is built upon tying up as much of the physical silver into our diamond hands as possible.  With that said, I thought I would add some clarity to my position on the various options out there to play the silver squeeze.

**It is organized into 2 sections:**

**1. the futures market (for big players)**

**2. alternatives (for smaller players**)

&#x200B;

**1.**

**The futures market:** for the squeeze to really happen, we desperately need some of the bigger pocketed players who have access to the futures market to purchase silver contracts on the open market.  **If you can play in the futures market, it is imperative that you do so.**  I have been trying to find a retail broker who will allow customers to take physical delivery rather than force cash settlement but have had no luck so far.  If anyone knows of such a retail broker, please let me know so I can update the post with the info.  This is by far the most important piece of the short squeeze equation.

Let me explain:

When traders hold long futures contracts to expiration, they are making a statement that they want to take delivery.  Taking delivery does not mean the silver is transferred to your house, but rather it goes to the CME warehouse.  You can go pick it up from the warehouse or arrange transfer, or you can pay $8.50 a month per 1000 ounces to just store it at the warehouse (which is quite cheap at that scale).  The futures market allows players to use extreme amounts of margin and leverage, which is where the 'naked shorts' come from.  They are able to sell massive amounts of silver with very little collateral to back it up, and no actual silver on hand.  **This also explains why institutions such as citadel or others hold positions in the ETFs like SLV.** If you have more than 50,000 shares in SLV, you can request to have your share of the silver delivered to you.  They are hedging against their naked shorts in the futures market by trying to gain access to a source of silver should they need it.  The thing is, if the short squeeze occurs, even their holdings in SLV will not be enough to meet their obligations.

In order for the buyers to call their bluff they need to not use their margin power, as tempting as it may be to do so.  They need to only purchase as much silver in the futures market as they actually have money in their account to cover the final purchase (the price is locked in at the time of the futures contract purchase).  Then as expiration approaches, refuse to settle in cash, and pony up the money to actually buy the silver and have it delivered.  At that time the seller needs to find silver fast, and tries to purchase it from somewhere else to meet their contractual obligations.  The rush of all the naked shorts to try and find physical silver is what massively drives up the price and causes the short squeeze.

There may even be dips in the futures market if the buyers are planning to do the squeeze.  This is because they will not be using margin whiles the seller are.  The sellers may be able to push the price down temporarily, but when expiration comes they will find themselves in one hell of a bind when they find out all of the buyers actually have the cash in their accounts to take delivery and refuse to settle in cash.

As the supply of silver dries up and literally there is no way to fulfill the obligations of the long contract holders, the silver futures market will actually be effectively shut down.  The CME will force settle all remaining contracts for cash at the current market rate (which will have spiked dramatically).  This is the last thing the CME wants to do, and will only do it as a final last resort.  If this occurs we can declare victory at having exposed the silver futures market for the fraud that it is.  A futures market is built on the trust that the sellers can actually deliver the product they are selling, and if they can't then that trust is destroyed.  If you go long and they don't have the silver to give you, you will still be paid the money for that amount of silver at the going rate.

Following this collapse the futures market will relaunch at a 1-1 margin requirement.  This means that for every silver ounce sold, the seller will actually have to have the silver or at least the collateral to cover that exact amount of silver on the open market.  The futures market will have moved from 250-1 paper to physical, to 1-1.  The massive banks who were naked short will have lost tens or maybe even hundreds of billions of dollars collectively.  In my previous post I implied it was likely JP Morgan naked shorting.  They have a history of doing so and being fined for manipulation, but we don't actually know which big players are the current naked shorts and who might even be net long.

**2.**

**This is where the rest of us come in...** if you can't play the futures market, you can still purchase and tie up physical silver where the naked shorts can't access it.  Thus setting up the environment for the squeeze to occur.  Whether its WSB players or some other big fund who sees what is happening and does the futures part themselves, they will only be able to do so because of the smaller purchases of silver by millions of smaller players.

**Physical silver:** by purchasing physical silver you are taking silver off the market that the shorts will need when the squeeze occurs.  You aren't directly causing the short squeeze, you are helping to set up the environment for the squeeze to occur, and you will have the silver to sell after the squeeze happens.

**Silver ETFs (SLV, PSLV, SIVR):** this is the same concept as the physical silver.  By purchasing silver ETFs you are locking up physical into the ETF's vaults, which wont be able to be able to be purchased by the shorts in the futures market because they belong to the ETF shareholders.  There has been a ton of chatter about whether ETFs should be used at all, and of the ETFs which is the best or most reliable.  Frankly if you have doubts about the ETFs, just don't use them.  All of the physical silver is already sold out so this is the easiest way for most people to play at this point.  If you prefer physical but it’s sold out or selling for ridiculous premiums, just buy the ETFs until the premiums come down and then sell the ETF to purchase more physical. It is possible that at some point SLV (or other ETFs) will no longer create new shares as silver becomes impossible to find (thus they cant create a new share because they can't the silver to back it up).   At that point the ETFs will likely trade at a hefty premium to NAV and it may no longer make sense to purchase them.  But that hasn't occurred yet so I'd say it still certainly makes sense to buy these ETFs.  We have no proof that they are lying about their silver holdings, and if they disallow new share creation, I'd say that means they really aren't lying about their holdings, otherwise they would happily take as much investment as we would give them to collect management fees.

**Call options on Silver ETFs:** Calls will have a similar effect to purchasing the ETFs as the market maker will have to purchase the underlying ETF to be hedged.  It has a levered effect that can both hurt and help the squeeze depending on which direction the silver price is headed.

**Miners:** miners will benefit from the squeeze but buying them doesn't help the squeeze occur in any direct way.  People buying miners will benefit if we are successful, but the more capital that flows into them rather than the alternatives, it will lower the chances of the squeeze being successful in the first place.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

**if monke have lot of money, long futures with no margin and take delivery.**

**If monke not have lot of money, buy physical silver bullion and silver ETFs**

Hopefully this answered some of the questions that flooded my inbox from the previous post.  Good luck to all.  GME and SLV to moon.  Lets squeeze the naked shorts, expose the manipulation, and take our tendies from the hedge funds.

The TD ameritrade % held by institutions changed today...to 112.39%... which is an odd number because that would mean that there is 71-72 million share. However there are only 69.7M shares. Me being the autist I am, I checked for SEC filings which I couldn't find anything as of friday. Used a calculator (its that weird thing with number buttons) to count each institutions holdings and it checked out to the reported number. 

I'm not claiming that I'm smart, in fact I'm a dumbass who made most of his gains off of TLSA. However, and this is a big however, unless I am even dumber then I think I am, there can not be more than 100% of a companies shares. This means that EVEN THE INSTITUTIONS ARE HOLDING ARTIFICIAL SHARES. 

Again the if comes in, if I'm not a total dumbass, it means that just the institutions have the ability to diamond hand this bitch into infinity.  

So overall where does this leave the retards and autists and fomoers. Well, I don't fucking know. Some how this situation has to fix itself, if the government steps in we might get fucked. GME could step in and we get fucked. OR the free market resolves itself and we all go to uranus where there is a special tendie town built for gmetards.

I am not a financial advisor, nothing I say holds any weight, I'm just an idiot who noticed an oddity in some percentages.

We're in uncharted territory here and are witnessing a short squeeze which has never been seen before. We also don't have retrospect to show us what really happened as it all played out.

But we can look to the fabled Volkswagen short squeeze a while ago. I don't care about short interest or float or whatever: Volkswagen became the biggest company in the world at that time due to a short squeeze. If we consider market cap alone, how high can GME go?

Let's use 1 trillion as a nice round number. Sure there are companies with larger caps, but fuck I don't want to complicate things. GME (according to corrupt-as-fuck Robinhood) has a cap of 17 billion. Divide 1 trillion by this and we get the number 57. GME has to go up 57 times it's current price to be a trillion dollar company. 

330*57 is about $19,000 per share. If this squeeze played out like VW back in the day, we can look forward to at least this target. I could be wrong, I could be retarded, but this is what the math is pointing to if history somewhat repeats itself.

TL:DR: Buy and hold GameStop with 💎 ✋.

Anyway, here what I think these sneaky fuckers did:

Let’s say Melvbitch is short 100 shares. He needs to get 100 shares somehow to close this position to make it look like he got out of his short, but how does he get them? Calls. 

So, he buys a $0.5 1/29 call and exercises it (we will assume that SIG actually has the shares, so this doesn’t trigger a gamma squeeze). But, he needs money to buy and exercise this bad boy, and where does he get that? Calls again. 

So, he sells 4-5 (based on what I am seeing value wise) OTM calls to get this money. This maintains his short position whilst making it appear that he is no longer short SHARES. He can also spread to the news that he closed a short position. 

If these OTM calls that he sold them expire OTM, he wins and gets out of the short basically. 

But no, thanks to the norse legend himself and all of you diamond handed autists, those bad boys expired ITM on Friday. Did Melvbitch have the shares for when these options got exercised, no. Did he get assigned them and is therefore still short despite making it appear that he is out? Yes. Now this fucker has to buy even more shares than he originally owed. 

Tldr: if I am correct, the S3 data is missing the options fuckery that they performed last week and they still have to buy hella shares. 

GME 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💎🙌

Edit: someone pls correct me if the S3 data would catch assigned shares."|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'SIG', 'I', 'OTM', 'HARES', 'OTM', 'OTM', 'ITM', 'I', 'GME']|['GME', 'SIG', 'GME']

**Thesis:**  
With the advent of online gaming and e-sport, Gamestop is prime to make a turnaround and grow again assuming it will change direction and adapt post Covid. The support of Ryan Cohen, a e-commerce marketing guru, has brought hope to a once-beloved brand and ignited the flame of this reality.  The stock is also enticing because of its 138% short interest which is the highest percentage in the market. Thus, a remote chance of a short squeeze could occur. *Majority of investors do actually believe in the company and is not in it for  just the short squeeze opportunity. *    
&nbsp;

--  
**Background:**  
Gamestop was once the most prolific gaming retailer in the brick and mortar time period. They made their profits by rebuying used games/gaming paraphernalia at low prices and marking them up greatly. They relied mainly on foot traffic due to a subpar online presence and they were slow to change. The low price and convenience of online shopping had won over shoppers causing the demise of brick and mortar. Large brands started disappearing left and right and now it was Gamestop's turn with a boost from Covid. Investors wrote GameStop off as a dinosaur company with its shares eventually dropping to $2.5 dollar.

--  
**Results:**   
Hedge funds saw this and decided to go short on them, betting on their demise like all the others. The funds abused the mechanism of the market to cause a large selling pressure onto the stock, forcing the stock price down and accelerating the demise. Could this be manipulation? If a hedge fund were to short a company out of spite, they could very possibly bankrupt a company.  

--  
**How did Gamestop survive for so long?**  
Even though they weren't raking in e-commerce profit, they were still profitable. It was just that that profit stream was shrinking. The profits were also concentrated at a fraction of their stores. As they closed unprofitable stores, they were able to offset cost slightly. Investors were also holding on to the imminent release of the new console super cycle. Investors noted that the golden days were right after the new consoles were released and Dec 2020 couldn't come quicker. Gamestop was patience and managed their financials well with a strong balance sheet. Investors had underpriced the real estate of theirs. They were not valued for growth anymore so they weren't in a situation to raise capital risk free. They have several billions in short-term and long-term debt but  they had 600 million cash in hand to cushion with. Lastly, the Nintendo switch had just came out and was the best selling gaming console ever. Gamestop rode the tailend of Nintendo success all through 2020 with Switch sales offsetting losses in the other gaming segments.

**The turnaround:**  
A new management team had join in August 2019 that set to slim down the company. They were much more aggressive and sought to aggressively close stores. A comprehensive turnaround plan called GameStop ReBoot  was announced with 4 elements:   
  
1. Optimized the Core Business  
	Reducing unprofitable stores and focusing on what works  
2. Become the Social / Cultural Hub for Gaming  
	Turning Gamestop into a experience center and not just a store  
3. Build a Frictionless Digital Ecosystem  
	Revamp the supply chain to be e-commerce focused  
4. Transform Vendor Partnership  
	Rekindle and make new partnerships   
  
Like all new managements, this one needed time but unfortunately Covid complicated the plans. Investors became increasingly doubtful and even bearish. However, they had underestimated the future of gaming. 

--  
The first significant move was bringing Reginald Fils-Aimé onto the board of directors. Reginald was known for his market prowess bring Nintendo to what it is today. Investors loved that. 

--  
As Covid happened, working from home and home entertainment exploded. Logitech, Corsair, Bestbuy exploded. Online gaming was projected to be very ludicrous in the next decade and Covid had shorten this timeline. Online gaming took off. Activision, Electronic Arts, Zynga, Tencent all exploded. Apple app revenue from their gaming segment exploded. Investors had repriced these stocks higher taking advantage of the first player advantage. One notable company that changed in valuation was Logitech, they were a value company but relabeled to growth. What was missing from this list was Gamestop. The bullishness in gaming was there and everyone else profited. If there was hope of a GME turnaround, their valuation model would certainly flip to a growth model at higher PE multiples. It was only fair.    

--  
The next big event that occurred  was in October 2020. Gamestop announced a partnership with Microsoft which was the first real tangible milestone on the turnaround plan. Investors started to give the company a second look.  Microsoft Partnership caused shares to rally 30% in a day. A bullish sign that the big players haven't given up. However this was short lived as shorts continue to drive the price down as there was no concrete details on the revenue sharing partnership, only that ""for every Microsoft Xbox console that GameStop sells going forward, GameStop will get some percentage of the revenue from every digital full game download, DLC, microtransaction, and any subscriptions as well."" To me this sounds very bullish that Microsoft still believes in Gamestop.  
 
--  
Next came news that the well-respected businessmen Ryan Cohen released that he had bought up 13% of Gamestop shares, becoming a minority owner. Ryan Cohen was the founder of Chewy, a Petsmart online branch that outcompeted Amazon. Investors labeled him an e-commerce guru/genius. He had bought shares at $4.81 and slowly gobbled up more as the price increased. Rumors started speculating that Cohen would takeover and transform Gamestop and it was materialized when Cohen sent the management a very aggressive letter.  

--  
""GameStop’s leadership should immediately conduct a strategic review of the business and share a credible plan for seizing the tremendous opportunities in the rapidly-growing gaming sector. GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences – not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem.""  

--  
It was a do this or else there will be a hostile takeover. The letter was sent three weeks before Q3 Earnings and investors were now watching intensively for details of a roadmap or of a Cohen reference during the earning call. ER came around and management was mute beside the announcement of a shelf offering of 100mil. Company performance wise, they were negative on profit but had still beaten expectations. The expedited closure of unprofitable of the stores helped. The stock would have soared had not an offering been announce (offering dilutes shares) so instead GME dropped 17%. From the conference calls, many bull investors felt reluctantly weary of this turnaround while some even dismissed management consideration of Ryan and piled on to the shorts. A week later, a filing by Ryan Cohen showed that he had continued to believe that the stock was undervalued and bought even at $14.83. This news rekindled the speculation that Ryan Cohen was going to do a takeover. Stock bounced and soared to $22.35 dollars for the next few weeks before dropping to $17.35.    

--  
**Jan 2021 - The first squeeze:**  
Shorts were still convinced that Gamestop would not be turn around and so they held steady with a short interest above 130%. Some short sellers had left while new ones piled on.    

--  
Monday, Jan 11th, Gamestop decided to drop bombs to the short:  
- First with an announcement that there was 309% increase in e-commerce sales from 2019 holiday season, 4.8% increase in comparable store sales, 3.1% decrease in total sales.  
	- The biggest takeaway was that their new e-commerce strategy was working. 309% increase is massive. Also this followed their original plan to concentrate on their core. Rise in sales of profitable store was also shown. The closure unprofitable stores hit their total sales but it was not much and implied that these stores were dead weight. They slimmed their bleeding cost segment and increased their profit. This was super bullish.  
- Secondly, a board of advisor switch up was announced. Ryan Cohen and two main Chewy guys were hopping on, replacing 3 other people. 
	- Ryan essentially brought Chewy Management to Gamestop. They know have 1/3 of the company's vote.  
	- GME Management knew that a takeover was happening, hostile or not and so they opened the doors. They also expanded Ryan Cohen's ability to buy up to 20% of the total shares  
	- Permit And Hestia Capital also align more with his vision so that would put them at a 5/9 majority  
Result: Even with the news, the stock price stayed range bound at 20.5 and volume was extremely low for that Monday and Tuesday.  Shorts were once again depressing the price. However, Wednesday came and the first of the shorts closed their position while bulls bought calls. The stock soared. This catalyzed into a gamma squeeze to kick off the huge rally.  

--  
The analysis stopped dead of the gamma squeeze as these recent events have been a gray area of interpretation. Enjoy.

dick-eating bear thesis that the SQUEEZE has in fact, been ALREADY SQUOZE.**

_Let me preface that for all the 5M newbies to this sub, I
am saddened that my favorite sub since 2017 has been invaded by normies. But at
the same time, I am excited for all the new amount of fodder (yeah, you) for
memes. So WELCOME TO THE GANG, GANG &lt;3_

**

THESIS: The big short squeeze has already happened.**

**

When?**

Approximately from the when our lord and savior Burry probably cashed out
(sometime before his settlement date for 13-F filing coming out in 2 weeks
time) to when the news broke and Cramer shat his pants on CNBC last Monday.

**

Why do you think this?**

First, MELVIN was NOT the ONLY ones SHORT, they were just
the slowest ones to cover (and hence probably will continue to be the poster-child for
bukkake gang-rape by millennials and zoomers with stimmy checks).

Second, GME literally went from $5 per share to $37 per
share by January 15, 2021, the settlement date for the latest short float
update (I’ll come back to your fucking daily updates from S3 Partners and Ortex
later on, and why I don’t trust them).

To put it into perspective for these unscrupulous, criminal,
BIG money positions on the short-side that have been here a LOOOONG time,
that’s already a 750% loss.

If someone had put in **JUST** $1M in August 2020 (by the
way, the short float % was around 99% at this time, so I KNOW more got in short
after this) hoping for a Gamestop bankruptcy, by Jan 15, 2021 these fuckers
would have lost $8M in total (initiating position would have been about 200K
shares short, by the time it gets to 1/15/2021, $37 x 200K shares =  $7.4M.

So, by wagering $1M on the short side, you now have to buy
back and return your shares. You now have a $6.4M loss.

**WELL THAT FUCKING SUCKS? Right? Well then what does a 400-IQ,
uncircumcized-dick hedgie with a wedgie want to do about this situation? They
GOTTA make that loss back SOMEWAY SOMEHOW.**

You could suck trucker dick or deal drugs, but these
white-collar yuppies have enough power to NOT have to stoop down to that level.

**

Here is how they CAN, and probably ARE, doing it right
now:**

Melvin wasn’t the only short position. Just the most
retarded one that didn’t cover in time, so they had to go through a whole
fucking liquidity crisis, class action lawsuit, and dick-eating meme-fest while
literally asking for sugar-daddy money. What about the less retarded short
positions? Well, they probably have some losses too, because I mean, they did
get squeezed in the earlier portion of the play, but now they have sights on
something else.

**First, your hedgies (excluding Melvin & Citron)
continue to push the narrative: “Throw Melvin & Citron to the masses and
keep the retail investors coming in with their diamond hands and high school
diplomas.”**

Second, **hedgies go LONG on GME shares now**. WTF HOW?
Well remember that for short positions, there are LENDERS of these shares.
These lenders would happily let go of their positions at the “top” of a
squeeze. (It’s ez fucking profit, and they want none of this mess).

Third, you now have a long position with underlying shares.
What’s the best play here? You fucking write call options because the vol
premiums are literally mooning at the moment. And I’ve been on WSB long enough
to know that WSB’s risk management is literally just selling one-paired organ
to afford the option premium on FDs.

Lastly, you push the narrative of a “GAMMA SQUEEZE” which is
JUST a little bit too hard for your average joe from Mississippi to understand
with his Algebra 2 from high school – Essentially telling him, “HEY THERES
STILL MORE TO SQUEEEEEZE.”

 

**

REAL Gs MOVE IN SILENCE:**

Look at the volumes, the float rotation in the past week for
GME is already enough to have fucked virgins 20 times and sacrificed them to
capitalist gods. 

Which means for hedgies with wedgies, it’s no longer a
tail-risk, blind-side event, it’s time to REAP the souls of every stimmy check
fool, by “MaRkET MAkInG”.

If I am that Hedgie, I write call options, while maintaining
a façade that I will “rationally” hedge those positions by buying more of the
underlying shares. FUN FACT: I already have them.

You stimmy check tards will keep buying into GME, because
you heard about it in the news over the weekend and want to get in on this
action to “STICK IT TO THE MAN” because 2020 has been an absolute suicidal
descent into madness because of COVID. You will probably go on for a couple
more days this upcoming week, now that liquidity restrictions are slowly being
lifted on trading platforms.

SO, while you fools supply buying volume, all I have to do
is collect my premiums on option sales, while slowly unwinding my underlying
share positions, and thereby also managing risk of option assignment since I’ll
sell shares into every spike and swerve the price away from the strike price of
YOUR options.

And I’ll also have an expectation as to where GME could
potentially rise to. You just look at the WSB subscriber count, multiply that
by the avg retail trader account liquidity.

You guys will think you have stuck it to the man, but the
man is sticking your wife ALREADY, ever since the moment you got angry and
emotional about an opportunity to unleash your pent up hatred towards the Wall
Street system. All I am saying is, for every tard like Melvin, there’s 20 other
hedgies out there to fuck you up without you even realizing it. After all it’s
done, they’ll even make you feel bad, saying you were “Greedy” and “Reckless”,
further perpetuating emotional volatility in markets that they will keep
profiting off of.

So while the retail GME HODLER thinks there’s still enough
gold raining from the top of midtown Manhattan, all they’re getting is piss and
pre-cum.

 

**

APPENDIX – Ortex & S3 Partners**

If you got all the way through until now, I apologize for my
lack of presentation in this thesis, it’s literally 3AM in the East Coast US
because I’m up for 4AM pre-market (don’t fucking judge me, I’m a retard too).

So I’ll explain that point from WAY up there about short
interest estimates.

I don’t give a flying fuck what Ortex and S3 Partners says.
I do NOT believe that short float is STILL above %100 after the official data
came out on 1/27 with a lag of two fucking weeks from its settlement date on
1/15. The stock price moved so egregiously that every autist in Manhattan would
have literally gone bankrupt if they’re still short, NOT just Melvin.

See, here’s the thing. If the system is ALREADY built with
this **two weeks lag** on short data for individual stocks, what fucking
data analytics company in their right mind would NOT try to take advantage of
this time & information arbitrage? The system is FUCKED, but it gets
perpetuated because the ones perpetuating this have the MOST to gain.

Ortex and S3 Partners is purely a marketing ploy, they
hopped on this gravy train to get your subcriptions and some more clicky-clicks
on their website traffic so they can use those metrics to raise some more funds
later on.

And even if they believed in your cause, no smart data
analytics firm would willingly give up that information arbitrage to the
public, if they want to ever think about doing business with ANY hedge-fund in
town.

Therefore, I am sticking to my autistic thought that the
system is stacked (which most of you agree) against us. BUT, I urge you to be a
little bit more careful, because short float data can be misleading at best and
a total fraudulent bull-trap at worst. 

Again, If you are new here, welcome to the gang. This sub
will always be about losing money and becoming best friends with your wife’s
boyfriend. But over time, it will be about the friends and knowledge you gained
along the way.

Inspired by his analysis, I wanted to investigate the SEC's publicly available Failed to Deliver data and see how it compared to other companies over time.

I wrote some code to process the the raw SEC data and normalize the shares that failed to deliver by the total number of outstanding shares of the company. This gives us a view that where each company's FTD shares are expressed as a percentage of the outstanding, so we can fairly compare companies to one another.

(Before you ask, yes I account for fluctuating values of outstanding shares.)

I went back to the beginning of 2019, looking at a few of the recent meme stocks with short squeezes as well as the top 10 (by weight) in the S&P 500 as well as GE (as an example of a stock with very low short interest). Here's what I found.

[This is not normal.](https://preview.redd.it/9us7kdme1ue61.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddf843285adac642c3d15360c71e14ed04566a38)

Shares can fail to deliver for many reasons, but when large numbers of shares fail to deliver a likely explanation is naked short selling. For a thorough explanation of this, see [this article](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html).

Back in early 2019, both GME and AMC look like the others. All had sub-1% of their outstanding shares end up as FTD. But starting in mid 2019, both GME and AMC experienced three waves of progressively larger naked short selling attacks. This is known as [scaling in](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scale-in.asp).

I wanted to see if I could find corroborating evidence of news and price data which aligned in time with these waves of naked shorting. What I found were two stories, both similar, explaining how GME and AMC got to where they are today.

# GameStop

The first wave (small bet) of naked shorts occurred in June and July of 2019. GME reported Q1 '19 earnings on June 4th after hours, with a [bleak future outlook](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/06/05/gamestop-stock-plunges-nearly-percent-gamers-brace-new-era-consoles/). Overall sales was down $1.5B, net income plunged by 78%. This story is what formed the core of the bear thesis. The stock dropped 36% on the news.

[GME Q1 '19 Earnings. Oof.](https://preview.redd.it/vbrosels1ue61.png?width=2804&format=png&auto=webp&s=b04f103567aa52b8af929191f14fbae86a41f0e4)

But things changed when Q2 '19 earnings came around. Yes, sales were down again and the numbers didn't look good, but the company announced it was going to [reboot with a major strategic update](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/09/10/1913815/0/en/GameStop-Reports-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2019-Results.html). They were going to make their retail stores more efficient by closing some locations, focus on becoming a social hub for gaming, and build a digital platform around the relaunched GameStop website.

Investors liked the news and the stock tries to move upwards, but is repeatedly beaten down. This lines up with the second wave of naked shorting. The original short sellers couldn't let the price float up, so they resorted to more than doubling down on their original naked short bet to keep the stock trending downward.

[Naked Shorts double down, gotta drive it to zero faster than they can rebuild!](https://preview.redd.it/p6x5x8zw1ue61.png?width=2772&format=png&auto=webp&s=382b78b87a737dc480f85bccea573096ca681706)

Finally COVID hits the US in March and April. Lockdowns happen and it becomes clear that nobody is going to malls anytime soon. This is where the third and final massive wave of naked short selling happens, attempting to push GME into bankruptcy. Remember, that's always the goal with naked short selling. If the company goes bankrupt, especially with a convenient parallel story (""It was a failing company anyway and COVID was the nail in the coffin!""), then nobody bothers to look into how many counterfeit shares might be floating around out there. They aren't worth anything, so who cares!

At its peak, **over 20% of the company's entire outstanding shares were failing to deliver every month**. This is confirmed by a tweet from Michael Burry (since deleted, he scrubs his tweets) that says when he tried to recall his lent-out shares, it took his broker **many weeks** to locate them. Remember, companies normally have well below 1% of their outstanding shares fail to deliver every month.

# AMC Entertainment

To understand how we got here with AMC, you need to look back further, to 2017. AMC has been struggling to be profitable for a while. They had a history of posting very small net profits along with many net losses. Their cash on hand was hovering around $300M and their corporate borrowing had been going up.

[Trying to hard to not lose money.](https://preview.redd.it/g7zugy792ue61.png?width=1876&format=png&auto=webp&s=f580cf12bad13197ed1426466d8b183a4191933e)

[Surely borrowing will make this problem go away!](https://preview.redd.it/jtgjqlu92ue61.png?width=1876&format=png&auto=webp&s=93a8ac04fd426390354024ce016a2a08df36c79f)

What coincided with the first small naked short bet on AMC in June/July of 2019? Their cash on hand just dipped below $200M (from being stable around $300m). The last time that happened, AMC more than doubled its corporate loans. The short hedge funds smelled blood in the water.

The second bet, where the naked shorts doubled down occurred in November of 2019. What happened then? AMC Q3 earnings, which showed that cash on hand had dropped to a precipitous $100M. Bankruptcy was in sight for the hedge funds...

And then COVID hit. Their massive third wave bet was similar to GameStop, though slightly more delayed. Why? May 2020 was the peak of naked short selling, around the time when some businesses were able to reopen with restrictions, but it was clear that **movie theaters**, among a few other things, would be staying closed until the pandemic was completely over.

Also like GameStop, at its peak **over 20% of the company's outstanding shares were failing to deliver**. This is not normal.

# Conclusion

I think the evidence shows there is a strong reason to believe that one or more hedge funds, probably in collusion with broker dealers or the DTCC, have been deliberately naked short selling both GME and AMC since mid-2019. They made small bets to start with in the first wave, doubled down a few months later, but stupidly went all-in for the kill when COVID hit the US. It presented a unique scapegoat that nobody would question for pushing a failing mall retailer and a dwindling movie chain out of business.

Where does this leave us? I don't know. Unless this results in some kind of economic crisis (and I'm beginning to think it will), I don't see anything getting seriously investigated or changing. This is the same crap that happened with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008, but nobody was went to jail for it. Of course they were going to keep doing it.

**This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and paste.**

Positions: 100 GME @ $36, 500 AMC @ $2.75 (but I wrote $3 calls before it mooned... GUH)

After what happened with gamestop, I'm convinced that this shit really might work out. On the other hand there are a lot of people thinking that this is just something to draw attention away from GME and withdraw fund from the stock. Let me assure you this is not my attention. And if you're all about GME I suggest reading here because it's a waste of time.

I personally think that slv really might be the next big thing that could work out. Therefore I'd suggest to not go against the idea generally. Keep your hands at gamestop as long as you want, but once work is done, get together into this next big thing.

\*\*Here's what happens or might happen:\*\*About the theory of the silversqueeze. Can't really be compared to the GME squeeze as it is not about squeezing out hedgefunds shortsellers in particular. The idea is that the silver price is priced way too low for the amount of silver that physically exists. The silvermarket volume on paper (exchanges/Futures..) is 250 times bigger than the supply of physical silver (just read this and didn't do my own DD if numbers are correct). The Idea is that a physical shortage will be caused and this would really let slv skyrocket with all that derivatives that are not backed. Now imagine some 7 million apes and the following retail investors that come after suddenly plunger the physical silver market...

Example: Let's assume there is a shortage and Person A wants physical delivery of the future he bought. Person B as the seller needs to deliver 5000 ounces of silver. If supply is short, the person buys another future from Person C in order to be able to deliver the slv needed. You understand the reaction this causes.

Also the silver market is said to be manipulated and kept low for a long time. I have no opinion on this.

\*\*What happened on the weekend?\*\*Silver already surged 20% since friday morning which was most likely a result of the news of ""Wallstreetbets taking over silver"" and ""Shortage in silver supply"".example: [https://twitter.com/bitpanda/status/1356023060814585859](https://twitter.com/bitpanda/status/1356023060814585859)Also I noticed several locals stores and online stores being sold out completely on silver and it looks like this is not only regarding a few small dealers.[https://www.theepochtimes.com/reddit-forum-sparks-physical-silver-shortage-on-major-dealers-websites\_3679079.html](https://www.theepochtimes.com/reddit-forum-sparks-physical-silver-shortage-on-major-dealers-websites_3679079.html)Also social media generates a lot of heat.

So it look's like it's happening - if we're heading to a global shortage, prices could absolutely go to the moon and this is a big time chance to be with it at the beginning right now. Additionally there is a good chance that shortsellers have learnt from what was happening with GME and they might get out of their short positions earlier which will generate further momentum.

**What you can do** in order to participate and make this work:It does not help the cause if you buy mining companys (even though it might generate good income). But still, in order moon the prices, you'll need to invest physically. The options are:\* Buying silver futures and let it physically deliver. Only possible if you can easily invest some 150k.\* Buying slv or pslv if you live at the hamburgers, and for instance ""Xtrackers physical silber"" if you're from Europe. It's really important that you check if the fund needs to fully physically cover it's assets (=buy silver). Because not all do so.\* The next option is to physically buy silver at your local store or webshop.\* At last, you can buy options. Your counterpart might want to hedge the positions and therefore will potentially be covered. This is also obviously the part where you can win big time (or lose everything). My weapon of choice is:  34.00C expiring in April

I prefer a mix of above.

But as we all know, I'm just another ape sharing brainfarts, hence I'm definitely not in the position to give financial advice. Also I'm long on slv, silver options and bought the silver of some local shops.

TL;DR:This post is **NOT about GME**. No selly selly - I get the hype! But silver might be one of the best chances for the upcoming weeks I believe. And today it's still a chance to get in early at low prices.

e/okay, guess we have to wait until GME is through. Looks like most in here aren't open for a new relationsship. Anything that's not GME/AMC gets downvoted to hell. ITT: People with weak hands scared of any funds going from gme to slv - this is ridiculous.

I spent the weekend looking for good opportunities to flip wall street. I set out looking for stocks that have good technicals to pull off a GME style short squeeze. I think DMC Global Inc, trading as BOOM (yep, that really is the ticker), is our best play. Here is why.

To find a play, I am looking for companies that are way over shorted, that aren’t too big and that could be squeezed by a WSB onslaught. I looked for these things:

1. Stock where there is **more than 100% institutional hold**, which indicates naked short selling
2. Stock where there is **more than 15% of float that is openly shorted**, these are shares that have been borrowed and shorted.
3. Stock with a **reasonable market cap** so we can move it, smaller is better here.
4. Any other factors revealed by a review of the company.

I am not an investment advisor and I am not giving any investment advice. #DYOR I have an MBA and know how markets work. I’m a geek who got into coding and finance in high school and working and investing for more than 20 years. I bought my first Jag with investment gains and people asked if I was old enough to drive it! I also got screwed over multiple times by banks and institutional investors. In 2008, I lost 3 years of my hard work investing when a broker closed out some of my positions at the worst possible crashing moment (to protect me!) and left me holding a bag of shit. I watched my broker front run my trades. When started with OTC, I saw them settle their prop desk’s least favorable trades of the day to me. Robinhood didn’t invent this stuff. If you’re in this to change Wall Street, let’s break their trades and take back the markets.

First, I think targeting companies like Nokia is a bad idea. **NOK has a market cap of 25.6 billion and not enough shorts on it. It will be very hard to move such a monster. BB is another case with few shorts and almost 9bil mkt cap.** AMC with a cap of 4.5 billion is already a challenge. GME was around 2 billion when we started this and it’s 22 billion now - very hard to hold at this level. We have to ask: **“How big is this challenge - a mountain or a boulder?” and “Who’s on the other side of  the trade and how deep?”** Keep these questions in mind before we move.

Secondly, **this is not long term investing** \- we are playing a hard game vs. wall street. It’s about momentum and trade positions. Company data doesn’t matter: EPS, EBITDA, cash flow - it doesn’t matter for a short squeeze trade. With GME, we have given the company a great opportunity to raise funds and pivot, but its future depends on management. We bankrupted Melvin. That is our achievement. Our goal is hitting the crooks on the other side of these trades: Citadel, SAC, Robinhood, etc. The company is just the football in this game.

Two interesting companies are Teradata Corp and Allogene Therapeutics Inc. These are short squeeze opportunities as well. TDC, has a 105.98% institutional and a 19.46% short interest with a cap of 2.9billion. TDC is almost 4x bigger than BOOM, so it will be harder to move with lower beta and a lower institutional so moves will have less impact. ALLO, has a 61.46% institutional and a 19.52% short interest with a cap of 4.9billion. Price action is not aggressive either but Allogen 8x bigger than BOOM and could be much harder to move.

After looking at these and several other candidates, I found the best option, one that I believe could be successful in less than 3 days. It is DMC Global Inc. (NASDAQ:BOOM)

1. **DMC has 114.49% institutional hold** \- this means that there are hedge funds that have big short positions on this stock, many of which are naked. Naked shorts create the phantom shares representing 15% more than the float. Naked short is when you short the stock and the lender who let you short sell the stock actually didn’t deliver the stock to you. This creates phantom shares. *Let me say that again:* there are 115% of the issued shares in play, that extra 15% in play *does not exist, but is owed*. These shares have been short sold without actually having shares to sell.
2. **DMC has 17.46% Short Interest**, so pretty heavily shorted. This means that pushing the stock up will squeeze that like a big zit on a small face.  This is way bigger % than NOK and BB who have a little zit on a big face.
3. **The market cap is just around 1 billion**. It won’t take huge volume to squeeze this one.
4. Other interesting features are a) **beta of 1.3**. The stock historically moves more than the market and b) recent price moves are up, but the **stock hasn’t had any crazy big run**, so there is a lot of room to push this up really fast. c) fyi: DMC has a real business manufacturing metal parts and accessories using explosives for the energy industry,
5. **It trades under ticker BOOM. This is a poetic bonus for this story.**

After looking at these and lots of others. I concluded that the best play is BOOM, it’s just like a ripe cherry waiting to be picked. I can find no better chance of success than this: a perfectly sized company that is as leveraged and as owned by hedgies as this. **I put this out for everyone and let the WSB mods decide.** The situation won’t stay like this for long in these volatile markets, so if we decide to act, it must be now.

It is a revolution! It is regular people against the establishment. It's the unemployed bankrupting hedgefunds. Throw away your old valuations and look at this new. This is a movement....and there's fucking value in that!

How high can this go? This is where Ryan Cohen shines. We never know how far he will take this, but I know the dude is fucking brilliant. So fucking brilliant that I'm willing to give him my entire 401k to make this happen.

GameStop is no longer a retailer, it is a viral company. We need to value it like a viral company. Look at Dollar Shave Club. (Almost) everyone buys razors and doesn't give a shit where they come from. But DSC changed everything. People WANTED to buy razors from DSC. I believe we will WANT to buy from GameStop. Fuck, I love this company (and stock) so much, if GameStop starts selling razors, I will buy them.

Dollar Shave Club was sold to Unilever for $1billion when sales were around $100million ($200million projected). I believe GameStop has more value. They are going to increase sales 3x or 4x. They will increase their online presence and start selling more products. This is going to be huge. My valuation of GameStop is 15x current sales, or $1,398.85 per share and my target price is $2,797.70 within 2 years. 

The short squeeze will push this stock even higher, but for the long term the current price is a bargain.

I'M HOLDING THIS STOCK!

I know GameStop is a good retail company and I'm confident they will grow after this, but it is also personal. The criminals who paused my trades need to go to jail. When they get out, I want them to see a fucking GameStop store everywhere they go. Every shopping center, every mall, fucking everywhere! I want Gamestop to be bigger than Walmart. To do my part, I will buy everything from Gamestop. If they sell toiletpaper, I'll fucking buy.

$300/share is a bargain.
Buy GME and hold

Not financial advice, do you own research
I eat crayons when no one is looking
HOLDING 150 GME @99 FOREVER! 
Love you all!

AMD, yeah remember the company everyone seemingly forgot about despite posting huge growth consistently in 2020? Well they recently had earnings and suffered bigly along with most tech. Some highlights from their earnings:

* Record revenue for the year with $9.76 billion in revenue
* Q4 Revenue up 53% to $3.244 billion (also record quaterly revenue)
* Gross profit up 53% to $1.451 billion
* Net income up to $1.78 billion compared to $170 million a year ago
* EPS up 867% (yes that is right) to $1.45 per share
* Cash flow up to $554 million YoY
* Q1 2021 guidance: 3.2B in revenue (79% YoY) and 46% gross margin
* FY'2021 guidance: 37% increase in revenue YoY
* Lets not forget their recent acquisition of Xilinx that will put them in a great position for the future

Also in light of the diversion and fake news tactics we can now observe, e. g. concerning silver, all data has to be regarded with caution.

Short positions have to be filed officially but with some delay. The last official update is from January 15th, 2021 and showed around 123% of GME float shorted. In the meantime, market intelligence firms provide reports about estimated short interest, which they sell as a product along with news and analytics services. Among these firms are IHS Markit Ltd. and S3 Partners.

According to Markit, short interest is now about 39%, S3 Partners states around 50%. Both values would be well elevated compared to the rest of the market. We also don't know to what extent these alleged numbers include new short positions at higher prices.

However, since the enormous short percentage of GME and the extreme increase in price, it can be argued that the short squeeze is not over and will continue, if the stock price stays elevated.

The short squeeze will only be over, if the shortsellers have abandoned old positions and are comfortable in new positions, if the intend to open them.

GME's stock price over time is one of the deciding factors here. If the price moves in favour of shorts still holding their positions, the may decide not to close them. If price stays elevated, additional shortsellers may need to close their positions, sending the price up.

\#Edit 1: For anybody criticizing this post: the percentages are, regardless if the allegedly came down, extreme numbers. It is logical that the massive increase in share price came due to some positions being closed and therefore Hedge Funds suffering. But the shorts are still in and that is why they use all their foul play. Someone on here recently deducted how high the percentage of retail holders could be. It was estimated 10 shares per user. The float is only 50m. The big squeeze is not off the table. Don't jump to conclusions because my post doesn't contain rockets and so forth.

BUY THE FUCKING DIP. THEY'RE PUNISHING THE RETARDS THAT HELD CALLS TO EXPIRY WITHOUT ALSO HOLDING ENOUGH MONEY FOR THE SHARES.




**TL;DR**
>Not investment advice. Market goes up and down, I think GME will go up. But this is to protect the true retards that held FDs through to expiry on a low budget account.

>They could potentially do a short attack to lower the prices enough that brokers margin call the owners of ITM calls on Monday. You can short the float for 100 shares, essentially making yourself delta neutral to protect yourself, then you get rid of them both on open with full gains.

Price is down $20 AH so be prepared for the morning dip. More scare tactics.

So, if institutional investors want to punish the retail investors they need to do it in a way that the retail investors have trouble countering.

In most cases, they would try to get the strike to where a majority of the open options positions would expire just under the strike with the most interest to keep people from having them executed and making money (in this case, the target would be <$320)

But my theory is, since there is a huge short interest, it's better for the big players to let GME finish above 320 which causes the largest open interest (300, 320) to all get auto-exercised.

Most retail traders don't know how to prevent the auto-exercise, so this causes a bunch of people to buy the stock at 300 and 320 (and various other strikes, under the 325 closing price)

Then they short the price down hard and buy to cover at the lower price in after-hours market, which has much less exposure to the retail investors. Right now the price is down to ~300.

This allows them to gain a profit of ~$20 right now on the execution of those 320s and potentially more, if the price continues to drop.

If the price actually tanks well below 300, this will additionally trigger margin calls Monday morning on the people assigned the shares at 320 and generate maximum profit for the short sellers.

It's too early to determine if this will happen since it would require a hell of a sell-off, but there is clearly an absolute ton of pressure to lower the price after hours to punish those who were holding 300 and 320 calls.

To give a more concrete example of how to manipulate the price:

HF buys GME when it dipped under $150.

HF sells GME 320 calls after it goes back up, for $$$$

Market pins GME at 325 at expiry, forcing auto assignment of 320s

Instead of allowing the cheap GME to be called away, they force the price down after hours.

They buy shares to cover their short calls at a discount, since they will get $320 for them.

Price was bouncing pretty hard between 300-320, but creeping back over 320 now. Should be quite interesting to see if it holds.

Ford is also making the electric Mustang SUV and I know a lot of people are pissed about the use of the Mustang name but in all honesty that car looks bad ass.

I like this options play because the spread for options dated two years out is really tight. I understand this is because the volatility is low and the chances of Ford hitting that price are remote but I'd gander that's in the absence of new information about an all electric lineup.

There is a VERY real situation on the available PHYSICAL silver you can buy. The stock SLV is so trash, it doesn't even keep up with Physical silvers price.

TD Precious Metals has been down for 2 days. Online stores are VERY low on stock.

>In response to the rapidly-evolving COVID-19 situation, the TD Precious Metals digital store is currently unavailable, but please check back later. Thank you for your patience

Locally you could call up your silver dealers and a lot of them are simply NOT SELLING! It's WILD. Just think, about this idea. let it ponder. Back in the day, 1 oz of silver = 1 dollar. If 1 OZ of silver was worth even 1% of our monetary system it would equal 2 MILLION DOLLARS an OUNCE!

Buying silver right now is insurance you have for THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. You really can't go wrong.

If even 6M people (IN THE WHOLE WORLD) bought 1500 worth of physical silver, the shortage would be SO GREAT, the price would increase over 1,000 / oz.

>**Constraints in Supply**Why can’t we just mine more silver? The reason we cannot “fix” the problem by mining more silver is the cost. Today for example, to mine gold, it takes $350 \[to $450\] to mine, refine, and bring to market one ounce of the yellow metal. With gold trading around \[$1200\] an ounce, that is a profitable endeavor. Silver however, is mined \[primarily\] as a by-product. In order to mine one ounce of silver as a primary metal, the cost associated with it is similar to the cost of mining one ounce of gold and with silver trading around \[$17 – $18\] an ounce and would not even be close to profitable when the mining costs are factored in. Currently we mine around six hundred million ounces of silver each year while industry consumes about eight hundred and seventy million ounces. Can you see a disparity developing? The market is tightening.

***TL;DR Read the constraints in supply, and this -> 130% of YEARLY silver harvested, is used in Industry!!***

Post will be updated with more answers and questions from the comments. This will help a lot of people!

#**Q1) The short float % seems to be going down from a number of sources. Why are these not correct?**

Responses:

- From u/kevinjing11: Short float % is what's publicly reported. Many ways that MMs and hedge funds can essentially fake this number through unreported phantom shares
- From u/Candle-Sticks: The short float % numbers we've been seeing are all estimates. The official reports don't come out until 2/9.
- From u/JesusHimself69: There's no way the hedges could have paid out their shorts that fast without the stocks rocketing up. Some on Thursday/Friday? Sure. But not over the weekend. It's just a scare tactic.

- From u/ whateverathrowaway00: 
http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html and 
https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf
The documents listed here show that the DTC ( central clearing house for stock trading ) has allowed counterfeit stock trading to occur for a long time. It is this environment that allows naked shorting to occur.
The SEC article above is from 2008 basically laying out how the restrictions put in place could be side stepped and it lines up. With this explanation, no one needed to call the DTC. There are no more shares of GME... period. That’s why even though short interest is being manipulated exactly as spelled out in the SEC paper above, there are no available shares to short in most brokers. The DTC raised deposit prices. They didn’t need a phone call. They’re not doing it to help any brokerages or hedge funds. They’re doing it to save their own ass. This is an opaque company that has the ability to shrug off congressional subpoenas. Independant actors all acting for their own gain is a much more likely explanation then widespread collusion. This is what makes sense to me. DTC raised deposits, allowing the shorts to unwind over time. The media will vilify the brokerages and hedge funds and no-one will ever ask where all the shares are. If that tactic does not work they will crash the economy in response.


#**Q2) Can't the hedge funds just keep doing more short ladder attacks and drive the price down?**

Responses: 

- From u/FudgieThaWhale: No, because they're losing money doing ladders in an attempt to acquire additional shares. If investors don't sell a dip then they just flat lose the money. They won't keep doing it because they can't.
- From u/Candle-Sticks: The ladder attacks rely on the HF holding shares, they can keep selling and laddering until they run out of shares. Of course they can easily buy more at the dips they artificially create.
- From u/storyhungry: Interactive Brokers currently says that the borrow rate is 16.97% for HFs


#**Q3) All these hedge funds are saying they're out of their short positions to align with question #1, we obviously don't believe them and they're probably racking up a ton of fees. How long can they really last?**

Responses:

- From u/FudgieThaWhale: It can last as long as they want to pay margin fees. I imagine that won't be for very long.

- From u/autodrafter2020: There is a massive amount of Failure to Deliver, and short sellers have to pay the clearing houses soon, it could be just days: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

#**Q4) When the short squeeze happens, what period of time are we talking about? Does it last 10 mins, 2 days, etc?**


#**Q5) How do I know if it's a short ladder attack?**

Responses:

- Click and read through this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7bhj/gme_mms_have_until_tomorrow_22_to_buy_shares_it/glmatag?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3


#**Q6)  What % of the float do we need to own before this starts to squeeze (and is this publicly available)?**

Responses: 

- From u/thejewsdidnothing :It is possible (and likely imo) that we already hold over 100% of GME’s float. Why haven’t we squeezed? Because the shorts are able to dilute the float with fake shares as much as they want. The real question that should be asked then is “at what point does the government step in to stop them, or when do the shorts accrue such heavy losses that they have to cover?” The answer is that we don’t know, but it’s only a matter of time.

#**Q7)  Why can't I buy more on Vanguard (relevant to other brokers too)**

Responses: 

- From u/Tainthairtwizzler : Vanguard no longer allowing you to use money transferred immediately. Just got off the phone with support and the funds need to be cleared through the 7 Day Hold before you can spend them. Must have been set over the weekend/today because I was able to buy BB from the same account but wasn't allowed to buy GME all during this morning.

#**Q8) Isn’t it plausible that HF have been shorting at 300- 400$ level and are now taking in big time on their own ladder attacks to around the 250$ level?**

Responses: 

- From u/Thefsm93: It is possible that they have been shorting at 300-400, except that the volume of shares being traded doesn't match the volume of shares needed for the short. If the question is more geared at them buying in at 300-400 and trying to short at 250, that would just make this situation worse because they would still then need to BUY.
Plus, why would they be artificially driving the price down with ladder attacks?

#**Q9)  How does the short % of the float matter if there are approximately 10M shares to cover with?**

#**Q10) (from others) I’m trying to get into the gme/amc craze but public / webull apps is taking anywhere between 1-7 days to confirm deposits before i can use the funds in my bank account. is this new? is there a way to expedite the process?**

Responses: 

- From u/waqas961: If you have a cash account linked to your bank on webull and you transfer an amount it will be available same day if did in morning or available next day as provisional funds to trade with until your actual deposit goes through which can take upto 5 days. I bought on 27th and 28th Jan but my actual deposits still show pending. Wire transfer however is different and for that you need to actually wait the whole time till it gets processed.
- From u/sutsusame: If you want to invest money right away, see if the brokerage will let you do a wire transfer. I use E*TRADE and incoming wire transfers usually clear within minutes, with no hold period. You will probably need to pay a fee to your bank.

#**Q11) What are some in depth posts that people believe should be read?**

#**Q13) What happens if HFs have artificially created the counterfeit shares to the amount we hold which they exactly need and then when the short squeeze takes place, restrict all of us 🦍 and basically resell it to themselves and make our shares burn to the ground?**


#**Q14) What happens if the short squeeze takes place and all of the brokerage houses crash, as we have seen they have restricted us from buying? Wouldn’t be surprised of seeing them not allowing us to sell at the most important moment. Btw, as we see that there is an insane amount of counterfeit shares, does that mean that this is hope they will save their asses by restricting the fake shares to be sold?**

2. If we buy SLV and spike it up, Citadel will sell SLV to fund their GME cover which at this point they aren't able to hence the ladder attacks.
3. HFs like citadel know how market psychology works -that people are always ready to chase the next best thing so that's how they are peddling SLV along mainstream media to divert funds from GME to SLV.
4. What happens when Citadel sells off SLV - SLV will tank and you as a retail investor will lose money.
5. What happens if we buy GME - they are forced to cover, it moons, we as retail investors win.

S3 Partners also reported that short interest has drastically reduced. Which is true. A lot of people are hating on them because, deep down inside, they want the price of GME to go back up so they can almost break even. Fucking pathetic. 

Lastly, DFV sold. He’s not in so I’m out.

Hi all! I believe the marijuana industry presents unique growth opportunity through legislative change. Here’s why I am long the sector and eyeing options..

Last week, Chuck Schumer accounced that Marijuana Reform Bills are being merged as Congress moves to legalize.

This is massive news, in fact, Stifel is calling this a Goldilocks Scenario for companies like Tilray.

>This could potentially foreshadow the most significant catalyst in the history of the U.S. cannabis industry

The ~~Roaring~~ Rolling 2020s 'Will Be Fueled By Weed' As Cannabis Experts Predict Regulatory Shakeups In 2021

>2021 should be a year of ongoing regulatory movement; expecting 2022 to mark the biggest wave the reform movement has seen so far

The marijuana industry is a beaten down industry with banking restrictions &amp; short interest through the roof. 

US Legalization is just around the corner and no one is talking about it. 

I strongly encourage everyone to research some companies and potentially get in before the media gets ahold of this story.

Here are a list of cannabis related companies you can look into with options:

Aphria, Tilray, Canopy Growth, Organigram, Aurora, HEXO

(Many MSOs still trade on the OTC, but will be pushing to uplist in the near future. Keep an eye on Curaleaf, Trulieve, Cresco Labs & Green Thumb)

There are also ETFs available with US exposure such as $MSOS

Also, it is important to deepdive the management in this industry, as it is with any other. A good management with tegrity goes a long way. I won’t go into detail, but, we’ve seen behind some curtains(walls) and it wasn’t pretty.

Politico said ‘There’s no stopping the industry now’: Democratic control is a big win for marijuana 

Stay safe & GLTA!

I am eyeing APHA 1/20/23 20 Cs @ 4.20 (currently long)

Check out that bullflag forming on the monthly.

Edit: Here’s a list of other cannabis related companies... Verano, Acreage, TerrAscend, Harvest Health & Rec, 4Front, Columbia Care, Sundial, Planet 13, GrowGeneration, Jushi, Vireo, Village Farms, Cronos

\*\*\*

[REMX](https://www.vaneck.com/etf/equity/remx/holdings/) is a Rare Earth Metals ETF that gives any portfolio broad exposure to all major rare earth metal miners and players in China, Australia and some more (e.g US including Lithium Americas and Livent).

This saves one from the hassle of trying to track individual Chinese or Australian RE mining / metal extraction companies while giving access to an industry that will be a key supplier to the EV market in China and abroad. The output of these companies is also critical for the renewable energy (wind) sector and electronics to a certain extent.

For all the talk of the US bringing back supply chains (or relying on MP materials), this is one sector that cannot be brought back in the immediate to short term. The ETF hit highs of 92 in Jan 2018 and I expect that in a high liquidity environment with policy emphasis on electrification it will touch and exceed those levels. The ATH of 2011 is 300+ but I am not sure how relevant that might be today (but is a technical indication of the last time we had a media driven rare earth metals craze).

In summary

\- If you are not sure which Rare Earth mining company to pick or you want exposure to the EV secular shift but are not sure which SPAC or EV maker will go to the moon, consider REMX (rare earth metals ETF)  
\- Solid performer over the last months, currently going through a pullback (83 to 75)  
\- Moves slow but steady and has strong tailwinds  
\- Not super volatile so easier to get out of if you find a new shiny thing  
\- OTM calls are cheap  
\- Most recent high within the last 2 years was 92

Full disclosure: I have one deep ITM call for Aug 2021 and some shares (small account holder). The ETF has done nicely for me over the last few months (got in at 40), and this current pullback might be a good time to buy."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082633.csv|DueDiligence|['REMX', 'EV']|[]|['DD', 'I', 'ETF', 'US', 'RE', 'EV', 'US', 'MP', 'ETF', 'I', 'ATH', 'I', 'EV', 'SPAC', 'EV', 'REMX', 'OTM', 'I', 'ITM', 'ETF']|[]

You can and should read the actual source which is linked in the article if you want even more detail. Great way to learn more about the underground bullshit funds have been getting away with for far too long.

In summary:

A consortium of hedge funds get together and plan a short attack by selling and buying counterfeit shares at lower and lower prices, driving the bid/ask artificially. With the disclosed short positions and the counterfeited shares, the true price of a stock can be manipulated much further than it should realistically should go. If the short attack meets resistance on the long side, they flood the market with their reserve of ""strategic fails–to–deliver"" shares and overwhelm demand. Usually they do these big attacks on big news days so that their fake volume is masked. But now, with GME, nobody is selling so all their action is out in the open!

They utilize '**Media Assaults**' which we have seen nonstop the past week with CNBC reporting 'sHorTs hAvE coVeReD' and now every outlet reporting on silver. It's all fake and these news outlets are in bed with the HFs. We've seen this evolve over the years to the social media bot attacks and disinformation campaigns. I'm sure the mods can attest to the thousands of bots they ban daily. I certainly saw them first hand in the Discord, promoting silver and other BS distractions.

There is a criminal **lack of transparency** surrounding short positions and the prime brokers, DTC, hedge funds all benefit. The SEC looks the other way because they are unfunded, powerless, and let's face it: they exist to protect big money.

**What can we do?** These events with GME and others have put these illegal and corrupts acts in the eyes of the public around the globe. The pressure needs to stay on these actions until something changes. The public should continue to voice their concerns to members of our government and push for more transparency and regulation against these outright malicious acts.

In the mean time, everyone should realize these ladder attacks are fake outs and are driven by miniscule volume. Everyone is, and should continue to HOLD (duh).

The article states that these short attacks are >90% successful. Well, looks like they fucked up big time by betting the farm and landing a critical miss.

HODOR THAT SHIT!

I got a lot of messages after my last post asking for thoughts of the big four, and BB is one that sticks out to me as having high value long term and not just through this current bonanza. 

Many of you have been seeing this ticker posted a few times called BB (blackberry for the less imaginative readers). Now, I am sure many of you new-comers to this sub probably are thinking “What in tarnation? This phone company still exists?” 

Yes. And the kicker? **BB is no longer a phone company**

In case you missed the news, BB is selling their phone stuff and going balls deep into automotive software. Not just any cars, but autonomous and EV. Every WSB autist’s wet dream.  I mean AI and EV in one company? No way this can go tits up!

If you look at older posts in WSB, you will see that BB was getting attention here for a while before the the current madness and many had high hopes that BB could rain in tendies in the near future. I am sure there are many here that have BB for under 10, which are probably the people who saw this potential. 

BB is selling away their phone patents to Huawei and partnering with Baidu (amongst other companies) to work on their autonomous driving technology. Specifically, BB’s operating system will be incorporated to be the backbone of Baidu’s autonomous driving platform. 

The news does not stop with Baidu. This is merely one example of BB’s expanding influence over autonomous driving, navigation, vehicle health protection, and vehicle security. At this point a simple google search with the words Blackberry + vehicle will net you dozens of results for projects they are working on and leading in the automotive software industry. 

All in all, I am very bullish on BB, especially long term.  What this all boils down to is if you think you’ve missed the boat on the big 4, BB may still be a good choice to jump in. Even if it pulls back, BB probably won’t leave you bag holding for long. 

Good luck all and may the tendies be with you.

The entire global media didn't all pool together in 48 hours to present a uniform story of ""buy silver"" as part of some frickin' conspiracy designed to save a few medium-sized American hedge funds. No more than COVID was made by the Chinese to win Biden the presidency, anyway.

So here, since you guys are too damn handicapped to use a fucking search engine, are a list of DD/YOLO/Discussion posts about SLV and Silver written LONG BEFORE THE FUCKING GME SHORT SQUEEZE FINALLY ROCKETED!!! Jesus fuck, you tinfoil wearing sack of ""fake news"" American mouth-breathers with the collective IQ of a doorknob.

Just look at the fucking DD and pretend GME doesn't exist for 5 minutes. Silver. Is. A. Deep. Fucking. Value. Play! It has value. So much fucking deep value! 

Yeah, no shit a market maker is holding silver positions when silver becomes more sought after, their job is to make fucking markets liquid. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SUPPLY LIQUIDITY IF YOU DON'T HAVE SHIT TO SUPPLY?! DID YOU NOTICE HOW THEY HAVE A LOT OF PUTS AND A LOT OF CALLS, AND NOT JUST CALLS?!

DO YOU THINK NO BILLIONAIRES HELPED RIDE GME UP? Do you think it was 100% retail on one side and 100% Melvin and Citron on the other? Ah, you do. Of course, you do.  


GREAT, WE GOT 8 MILLION DEGENERATES HERE. The 6M that didn't manage to find this place without hearing about GME having rocketed already, MAYBE DON'T FUCKING POST, COMMENT AND BRING YOUR DAMN IGNORANCE INTO A SUB THAT WAS ACTUALLY PROVIDING 2-10 DECENT TRADE IDEAS PER WEEK PRIOR TO THIS CULT FUCKING INFESTATION OF JACKASSES COSPLAYING RETARDS.

Whatever, here's a list none of you fuckers are capable of reading:

\- 5 months ago, /u/negovany wrote ""[Cornering Silver Market](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/idjk61/cornering_silver_market/)"". The whole thing is about JPM and squeezing silver. $GME was at $5 back then and /u/DeepFuckingValue was still getting laughed at for buying at every opportunity. Rest of you fuckers had barely gotten over the last cult following, PRPL mattresses.  
\- 6 months ago, /u/lucasandrew talks about ""[Why you should trade futures - WSB Edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i3qkex/why_you_should_trade_futures_wsb_edition/)"", in which he mentions ""*Speaking of SLV, people have been posting all the reasons that JPM fucks with the SLV ETF*"". Yeah, I bet he took a fucking time-machine back 6 months in time after Citadel got stuck in the boo-boo. 

\- 6 months ago, /u/LE0TARD0 implores the ""[SILVER CHAD'S RISE UP!](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hy7nvn/silver_chads_rise_up/)"". A straight fundamental thread on why silver is undervalued, not mention JPM. However, in the comments, a thread is started by /u/kbtech18 and supplemented by /u/ayyayyron talking about precisely JPM and their price manipulation of silver. YEAH, NO THAT NEVER HAPPENED, I'M SORRY FOR BEING A SHILL, LIKE FUCKING TAKE YOUR TINFOIL HATS OFF YOU DUMB SHITS!

\- 5 months ago, /u/Fuzzers wrote ""[September Silver Futures Contact - Something Aint Right Kids](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9b1th/september_silver_futures_contact_something_aint/)"".  
After hailing his fellow degenerates, HE IMMEDIATELY SAYS: ""*I know there has been 6 billion posts about silver,""* before later writing ""*A large amount of contracts will stand for delivery such as in July. If its enough, maybe some of the big banks who have short positions might find themselves in hot water with their silver delivery amounts."".* Isn't IT JUST GLORIOUS HOW MELVIN AND CITADEL HAVE ALL THESE TIME MACHINES TO MAKE UP IMAGINARY SILVER SQUEEZES 6 MONTHS BEFORE THEY WERE MADE UP? YOU GUYS ARE SO FUCKING DUMB RIGHT NOW, HOLY FUCK! DON'T INVEST IN SILVER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, BUT PLEASE STOP WITH THE AMERICAN FAKE NEWS CONSPIRACY THEORIES, IT HURTS MY ALREADY FUCKED UP BRAIN, STOP, I DON'T CONSENT!

\- 5 months ago (YOU GUYS, MAYBE YOU ARE RIGHT, ALL THE POSTS ARE FROM 5-6 MONTHS AGO, MAYBE IT REALLY IS A TIME TRAVELLING CONSPIRACY BY MELVIN AND CITADEL, YES, LET'S GO WITH THAT!), /u/jetter23, wrote ""[Weekend Update - Silver](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i6l0o2/weekend_update_silver/)"". What did he have to share, in terms of ideas and DD? "" *4a) Banks will continue to fight us on silver, but they are losing as they were massively short,*  "". WHAT SNEAKY FRICKIN' MARKET MANIPULATING HEDGE FUND SHILL HE IS, JUST GOING BACK SO FAR IN TIME TO SET US UP FOR THE PERFECT TRAP TO HELP CITADEL!!!

\- /u/jetter23 was quite active shilling 5 months ago, he also wrote ""[Weekend Update - Silver (DD#3)](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9uxok/weekend_update_silver_dd3/)"", where he just casually mentioned ""*JPM is currently under DOJ investigation AGAIN for price speculation on Silver. JPM is learning a VERY expensive lesson that when there is a pandemic, global FIAT currencies are crashing(like the DXY), and there is a run on physical metals - you can't be naked short on paper.""* IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE'S TALKING ABOUT SOME SORT OF SILVER SHORT SQUEEZE ON JPM, BUT HEY, THAT CAN'T BE IT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST A SCAM FAKE NEWS IDEA THAT'S 2-3 DAYS OLD, RIGHT? 

\- /u/CCJ_Moon_6969 popped his head into the stream of tachyons, relatively talking to us from the present all the way 6 months ago, when he wrote ""[Silver. $SLV call options. New York Comex.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hy8wv9/silver_slv_call_options_new_york_comex/)"". Do you remember /u/kbtech18 from a few threads up? WELL, GEE WHIZ, HE COVERED THAT TIME STREAM TOO, talking about JPM and silver. 6 months ago. I mean, today. Reddit probably changed the timestamps on the posts. DAMN SHILLS!  
\- /u/rawvi wrote ""[JPM and Silver](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i88cyy/jpm_and_silver/)"" 5 months ago, wanting to learn more about... time travel. Nothing to do with naked shorting of silver. BECAUSE THAT WASN'T EVER TALKED ABOUT ON THIS UNTIL 2 DAYS AGO, SO LIKE... HAH, HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ASKING ABOUT THAT, RIGHT?!?! CORPORATE SHILL BOT LOLOLOL!

$SOLO is currently only trading at $7.

Here’s my DD on why $SOLO is worth $400  🌖🚀🚀🚀 

According to my retardation Shitron Research is wrong on $GME (HTL) and $SOLO, which is actually a very solid long-term tendie. I’m including my positions below  🚘🚘🔋🔋🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

1. **SOLO is an undervalued and cheap EV stock 🚘🚘🚀🚀💎🙌**  
Electra Meccanica (NASAQ: SOLO) is a chad young EV company based in Vancouver, Canada, and is in process of producing affordable EV's: the Solo (a 3-wheel EV, costing $15k - I could haul all my stonks around in it, and a sports EV called the Tofino ($50k), and the fucking beauty ""eRoadster"" ($125k). They are producing several EVs simultaneously and have letters of intent for over 21,000 Solo purchases from various dealers worldwide, and recently started reservations for the eRoadster and Tofino. Their stock is currently trading at only $7 - basically making it a penny stock with a market cap of $628M. In my personal retarded opinion it's a *very* undervalued stock.  

2. **People don't think the 3-wheeled concept will be adopted ♿️♿️♿️**  
Nor did people think EV's could dominate ICE's. Or that TSLA could exceed the market cap of every other legacy automaker combined. But we autists knew we could. We retards knew we could. And look what happened. Now every autist is eating oven roasted tendies for brekky lunch and din. This company is trying to capture a unique segment of the EV market and is receiving heat from all sides, and that's exactly why SOLO is going to the mars to join lord musk.   

3. **SOLO is in a great cash position 💰**  
Great cash and investors. According to their Q3 results:   
*Cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits were CAD$101.1 million as of September 30, 2020, compared with CAD$11.1 million as of December 31, 2019.*   

4. **Citron 🐍 is shorting $GME and may go bankrupt soon - causing a short squeeze  🚀**   
When virgin Citron's attack on SOLO first came out in November, based on the headlines it seemed many people took the short thesis seriously. Obviously via recent events it was made very clear that Citron and the other Hedge Funds simply attack their short positions in a very dishonest way. If its short positions will be force-sold, this will force the stock to go higher 🚀🚀. Even though the floated short is only 15%, (not as high as $GME's >100%), a short squeeze can still very much be squozen.  

5. **Citron capitalized on the Nikola scandal to attack SOLO 🐍**  
The shorting attack happened shortly after the Nikola Motors & sus Trevor Milton scandal, which Citron mentioned in their reason for shorting the EV company. Don't compare a truck rolling down a fat hill led by a dysfunctional pedo guy to a canadian EV company (canadians don't lie).  

6. **SOLO has a $50k EV roadster in the works 🏎**  
In addition to the 3-wheel EVs, SOLO is developing a 50k electric sports roadster as one of their first vehicles, the Tofino. Having been a massive Tesla fan since 2014, this is really impressive to me, considering that Tesla's first ever EV was a mid-motor RWD Roadster which cost $98,000 in 2008 !!!  🏎🚀   
 
7. **Manufacturing experience and talent**  
SOLO's executive team is pretty impressive, the Founder and President Henry Reisner has a deep background in manufacturing. 🤖 They've partnered with major OEM's and have a manufacturing agreement with China's largest motorcycle manufacturer. Insider holdings for executive team are at 36.6% of the outstanding stock - they're in it for the long run 🚀🚀  

8. **I think I’m actually on the spectrum**   
Here's proof:

&#x200B;

$SOLO YOLO!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 $7 going to $400   


TL;DR: Citron Research is a dishonest Hedge Fund that shorted $GME and has $2 price target on SOLO, a Canada-based EV company in a great cash position and solid position for growth. Currently undervalued at $7, going to $400

This is what drove the shutting down of GME and other Reddit meme stock sales and avoided a complete meltdown last week.

https://imgflip.com/i/4w9ip2

There is a ton of conflicting information, market manipulation, and other bullshit out there.  We will not actually have reliable data that the shorts are covered until this is all over (real short data is only published every 2 weeks and is already 2 weeks old by the time of publication).  How the fuck do we keep our emotions in check in the mean time?

One thing is for sure, there is a MASSIVE effort to divert attention away from GME and other meme stocks going on right now.

If these guys were truly out, they wouldnt give a fuck and would just walk away with their money like they have for the last 10 years.  People dont spend A LOT of money trying to tell people what to think unless they have something to gain.

Ill be selling at $1000+ or when I havent heard SLV or GME on the news for a week.  Thats when well know this has changed from retail vs hedge fund to retail vs retail.

My monkey brain has been reading wsb far to long and I decided to put together a quick list of reasons why I think the squeeze will happen (or not, fuck you I lick doors), I sourced everything so that if you learn to read in the next little while you can give it a shot with those. This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor.

A) GME has been on the NYSE Threshold Securities List for over 35 days.  The streak of FTD (Failure to deliver) of shares continues. Where are the shares?

B) The last 3 trading days have had abnormally low volume. It's not coincidental that when the sentiment for $GME is at its all time high and price mooning, trading is/was being suppressed.  Last week was an obvious attack on retail investors ability to purchase shares and gatekeeping from upward momentum. An obvious tell that they would and did incur massive losses.

* Sentiment: [https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/wallstreetbets/ticker-sentiment](https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/wallstreetbets/ticker-sentiment)

C) Since then we've seen Short Ladder attacks everyday to force stop losses and paper hands in order to cover as much as they can. We saw on full display the perversion of MM's/HF's trying to fuck the average joe for their negligent behavior. We've recovered every time. This is an orchestrated attack. This could of ended long ago if they just covered.

D) Brokers no longer have shares to borrow for short sale.

E) Speculation that the shorts have been trading counterfeit shares, this isn't a unique situation and I wouldn't be surprised is this is happening. They could be trying to cover their tracks of this as well as prevent catastrophic losses.

F) The losses incurred should strengthen your convictions about the thesis of $GME.  Melvin needed to be bailed out, RH CEO lied publicly about liquidity and required a bailout today. I'm sure more will also be taking further losses in the days/weeks ahead. HOLD STRONG, they are trying to bait you through volatility, disinformation  and attrition/fatigue. We are gamers HOLD STRONG, consider this a time-gated mission before getting your legendary weapon.

G) The aggressive and blatant ramp-up of disinformation through media is immensely revealing. The billionaires are scared and getting their stooges to throw all the FUD at the wall to see what sticks, to ensure we don't hit the ""grand slam"" as Cramer put it. They are shilling silver (perfectr example), stating arrogantly that reddit is in on silver while out of GameStop ,or both (the swaggystocks sentiment tracker shows the complete opposite) and finally of course saying last week that the shorts are covering. Today's media was down right egregiously incorrect.

H) A large amount of January 29, 2020 calls (strike 115-325) finished itm. These shares will require fulfillment by tomorrow. This is a huge amount of obligated buying pressure.

I) Bloomberg terminal still showing over 120% SI. However there will be a clearer update of the short interest in the coming few days. I want to say the date is Feb. 9, 2020.  IMO shorts have not covered.

J) FINALLY, THERE IS ONLY ONE GME. NOTHING ELSE REPLICATES THE CONDITIONS. I LIKE THE STOCK AND RYAN COHEN. FUNDAMENTALLY I BELIEVE GME WILL REPLICATE CHEWY.  ALWAYS HAVE A TARGET BUT I'M HOLDING. THIS IS A WAR, WE CAN REMAIN RETARDED THAN THEY CAN REMAIN SOLVENT BUT THAT STILL MEANS IT TAKES TIME. DONT BE PAPER HANDED AND STAY RESOLUTE.

I believe that these 10 factors are converging and I'm holding.

I recommend you do it tomorrow at the open and grab LGND stock instead and here is why:

We always need a good reason for why we're investing. For the many who started sub $100 price point on GME, it was mostly because the short interest was through the roof at 140% when GME was at $5. That's fucking ridiculous. Because of that, there was strong potential for a short squeeze and a gamma squeeze even happened 1/22. Big applause to the retards who won that and drove the price of GME past $100.

Here is an example:  Melvin Capital closed their shorts on 1/26 when GME was at $148. If they were shorting since at least the start of January when it was at $17, then they lost $17 sold - $148 bought = $131 for each shorted stock they had. They bought at 148/17 = 8.7X how much they sold the stock for.

Ultimately, they motivated short holders to cover their position at a fat loss. However, shares short as a percentage of float still remained dummy high the same week. Why? Because new shorts came at higher price points of GME stock ($300+) than before. For those hedge fund institutions to be incentivized to cover their newer short position, GME would need to keep skyrocketing, at least into the $500 range to put pressure on their shorts at $300, and that isn't even 2x how much they sold the stock for. Remember, about 9X is when Melcin Capital finally threw in the towel.  If it does go that high and institutions do sell though, then they could  further carry it into who knows, maybe 1k+ where the moon awaits. Ok so if you're holding, goal is to get the stock to $500+ so that a short squeeze can happen. Remember, getting it to $500 won't happen because of a short squeeze.

This means that initial jump into a solid $500 stock price would need to be made mostly by retail investors, of which, have already invested into GME. Literally the WHOLE WORLD is on this boat including Europe and even China. Listen, if the hype was real enough to get global attention, that's the peak man! You're not gonna find more retail investors to jump onto the GME ship to carry it to $500+, there just isn't any more people. So, I don't think retail investors have the remaining capital to keep boosting GME stock price because its peaked its hype.

Still thinking GME has dummy high short interest and you don't care about what i've just said? Think again, more than half the shorts were covered Friday

What does this mean? If capital is all tied up and gme isn't moving up, people will sell. If they sell, you already know what that means... its over.

So to save my tendies and maybe yours, I'll be the first to say I sold my GME stock and moved it all into LGND. Wtf is LGND? Fuck if i know. But I do know (as far as my research goes) they're now THE MOST HEAVILY SHORTED COMPANY.

This was the whole reason why GME was a gem to begin with and it happened, that bitch mooned because we like the stock. But without the short position to help keep it bolstered, it doesn't have support like LGND does. The short position on LGND is at a super high 65% and most of those are from a month ago or before when the stock price was half. THIS MEANS THE SHORTS ARE PRIMED TO BE COVERED ALREADY! HOP THE FUCK IN BOYS. Positions = buy the damn stock.

TLDR; GME is dying. I like LGND stock better

&#x200B;

Edit: 🚀LGND🚀

To the many of you still thinking GME shorts are high AF and over 100%, thats because the information you're getting IS NOT UP TO DATE. The stock exchanges releases short interest data once every two weeks for the public to see. I paid to see data daily. GME short interest has declined sharply because shorts were covered. Here is a link to an article with a different graph than mine, same conclusion: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/gamestop-short-interest-plummets-in-a-sign-traders-are-covering](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/gamestop-short-interest-plummets-in-a-sign-traders-are-covering)

My claim is that another gap up this week is guaranteed if we hold $300.**

With GME pushed above $320 Friday, a huge wall of calls were exercised. Anyone who sold calls is now deeply, deeply underwater.

The longs haven’t won the battle yet though: holders of the short calls (largely Citadel at this point) have **two days** to deliver the shares. (See source below).

If I was in their position, would I start covering today  and therefore trigger a gamma squeeze? HECK NO. 

Instead, If I was a short, I would kick the can one more day while I try one more hail mary. I will attempt a large short-ladder attack to at least push the price down (if not outright induce panic-selling). At the same time, I would approach a large institution with shares (think Fidelity or Blackrock), and make an offer for a large volume of shares.

By pushing the price down, I can reduce my losses, and at the same time strengthen my hand in negotations with institutions that can offer shares.

If the hail mary works, shorts can at least get away alive tomorrow without even incurring “failure to deliver”

However, if retail is able to kill them at $300-$320 by open tomorrow, there will be a gamma squeeze the likes we have never seen this week (probably not THE squeeze yet, but a squeeze nonetheless). 

Panic-buying will start. Not all firms will do this panic buying, but I figure there are enough smaller HF shorts who don’t have a legal team to temporarily stonewall failure-to-deliver lawsuits. Those have no choice but to start covering.


**TLDR: no squeeze today because shorts still have one day of breathing room. Don’t just 💎✋🤲, BUY until we are at $300**

EDIT: for those asking for source on that GME is a physically-settled option: see this: The SEC only granted cash-settlement on a specific set of ETF tickers  (https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nyseamer/2020/34-88131.pdf)

For info on the T+2 settlement days on see page 9 of 42 (or 15/48 for whole document) of this: https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/filings/orgrules/17/06/rule061417occdco001.pdf

“Rule 903 governs the obligation of a Clearing Member to deliver when either a Delivery Advice or OCC directs that settlement be made on a broker-to-broker basis. It currently specifies the delivery date for physically-settled options as the third business day following the day on which the exercise notice was, or is deemed to have been, properly tendered to OCC. Rule 903 also generally specifies the delivery date for physically settled security futures as the third business day following the maturity date. Under the proposed rule change, these references in Rule 903 to the “third” business day would be changed to the “second” business day.”"|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'HECK', 'NO', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'THE', 'I', 'HF', 'BUY', 'GME', 'SEC', 'ETF', 'OCC', 'OCC']|['GME', 'GME']

First and foremost, I have 2,000 shares of GME which I first bought around \~$90 as I learned about the short squeeze thesis. I know I will get a ton of hate for this, but in full transparency, I will hold these until the price dips below my reservation price of $100, at which point I will likely dump to at least get my cost basis back. I am hopeful that this won’t happen anytime soon though.

I think what’s going on right now is a complicated game theory problem. I am still thinking through this so would very much appreciate any input from anyone that I may have missed.

**Actors:**

**The shorts**, which include the Melvins, the Citadels, and the Robinhoods. The Melvins represent all the hedge funds that are short the stock (Viking, D1, Maple Lane, etc.). The Citadels represent the market makers that have to take on a net short position to ensure liquidity and volume in the stock as the price rides up, and the Robinhoods represent the brokerages that have to post up increasing amounts of collateral to clearinghouses, as they are ultimately responsible for  losses in major downward movements in the stock (e.g., if someone buys GME at $500 on 100% margin, they in theory should be called when the stock dips to $250, but in the case of a couple trading days ago, we saw it go from $500 to $130 very quickly, making it difficult to liquidate the position on time and resulting in substantial losses for Robinhood).

**The longs**, which include institutions and retailers. Institutions are all the good guy funds like Blackrock, Maverick, Vanguard, etc. that are long the stock. The retailers are us. 

I think we all understand the situation in that shorts are in a world of hurt. If short interest truly is 100%+, and costs of borrowing skyrocket, there really is nothing shorts can do here. They will get squeezed and we will get our tendies. If. We. Just. All. Hold.

That being said, the difficult thing here is the lack of communication and transparency that works against us. I’d bet my left nut that Citadel is on the phone with Melvin, who’s on the phone with Maple Lane, who’s on the phone with Lone Pine coordinating every move, ensuring no one triggers the short squeeze. They’ve got more weapons in their arsenal as institutions to run things like ladder attacks which we all saw these past few days. Being on the long side, however, is a little more challenging. We need to have mutual trust across not just us, as retailers, which I think we have, but also with the long funds for which there is no open line of communication. There’s a chance that they could cash out their position for a solid gain with a willing short at a set price in an OTC deal. That would not affect the stock price but would dramatically reduce the short interest and leave us holding the bag at the end of the day. This is a very real risk that we need to have in the back of our minds.

The other wrinkle to this however, is that if a true infinite squeeze were to be achieved, all the short funds would go under. Robinhood would absolutely go under. And there’s a great chance Citadel would go under as well. While that’ll bring us tremendous amounts of joy, it would not bring Blackrock the same joy as their other holdings would surely come down quite dramatically.

I think the long funds have to understand this dynamic, and they’re clearly willing to play poker. They understand that there’s still squeeze to be squoze before reaching that catastrophic scenario outlined earlier, but as soon as it’s in their best interest to sell (before short funds and Citadel go under), they’ll get out. 

**My takeaway from all this is that there is still room to run here, which is why I’m still in, but diamond hands from all of us are needed and we need to proceed cautiously.** It’s an uphill battle to climb given our limited ability to buy stocks on certain brokerages and the shorts having an arsenal of weapons to use (including the Media), but if we have coordination amongst us, an unspoken coordination with long funds, and diamond hands, we should be able to rake in some tendies.

Very open to suggestions / questions / other theories."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|['GME']|['GME']|['I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'OTC', 'I']|['GME', 'GME']

New-ish to the market. I get the concepts but haven't ever dove into the details / DD.

More of an observation + question to those that know more about this than me:

&#x200B;

DATA:

Trading volume of 1.1m

Outstanding shares of 102.27m

% Shorted = 88.58

&#x200B;

Does this mean that 88.58% of the 102.27m shares are shorted? \~90.6m?

At a volume of 1.1m/day, if the volume was 100% short-closing, that would take,  +/- 3 months for them to be able to close all these shorts, physically is that right?

&#x200B;

Not that I think it will take that long, I get that the options might expire way before that. I am just asking if, theoretically, these short positions couldn't even close at this volume for at least 3 months?

&#x200B;

Trying better to understand the data and how it all relates to each other

&#x200B;

I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States. 

Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member  of a national securities exchange -- **(2)**  To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, *a series of transactions* in any security registered on a national securities  exchange, any security not so registered, or *in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement* with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such  security, or **raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.""**

Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here

Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter, which can be investigated quite quickly, not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government.

Finally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that ""Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in  violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, **shall** be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price  which was affected by such act or transaction.""  


I am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest and is AGAINST THE LAW. You must act now before it is too late.

Sincerely,

Your Average Retail Investor

tl;dr

AMC is the global leader in a $17 billion dollar industry that’s been beaten senseless to the ground with so much room to run. After pioneering deals with streaming services, buying out their competition, and upgrading their facilities worldwide, 80% short interest is highly inappropriate for its TRUE fundamental value — $69.69 a share.

""I'm questioning whether they\[WSB\] are actually doing the research when it comes to things like GameStop and AMC ..."" *- clueless* [*CNBC dude*](https://youtu.be/DYZHtF-tV0k?t=97)*.*

I fuckin miss movies. And when I say movies, I mean the whole damn experience. I wanna buy my $15 popcorn, pour an ungodly amount of butter and jalapenos on that shit and munch in a recliner seat watching in laser 4k quality. I like this company. I like this stock.

For the past few days, I've been scouring Google for news articles and company data. I've also been trying to find some detailed DD in here but they’ve all been pretty limp-dick when it came to AMC. And most of the news articles I've read were surface-level AT BEST with a grim outlook based on first-glance analysis. Guess these analysts are just too damn lazy to dig deep.

Because when we dive into these issues, we can easily see that the theater giant may not be in as bad a situation as the media/analysts are claiming.

In fact, I believe that **AMC is absolutely misunderstood, overlooked, and** **undervalued.**

Here is why I am more confident than ever that $AMC will not only reach $30 but is in the perfect setup to see ATHs and WELL ABOVE.

# I. Ugly Start, Beautiful Setup

Chances are if you are currently holding a significant position in $AMC, then most likely you've already read up on the company and its current standing in the cinema industry. You've probably read about how the corporation has nearly [$5 billion dollars worth of debt](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/amc-could-benefit-from-bankruptcy-analysts-say.html) with many of its locations still closed as the pandemic remains a global issue. You may have realized that new movies haven't been coming out. But more than that, you're seeing that movies are just being[ released on streaming platforms](https://hbr.org/2021/01/will-movie-theaters-survive-when-audiences-can-stream-new-releases) anyway. You might be concerned for AMC, or even the industry as a whole.

All of these concerns are very valid and based on real uncertainty, but let's break down each of these points and see if they’re as bad as analysts claim.

# II. A Discussion on Debt

Media outlets keep honing in on this debt like it’s an ugly scar of the corporation. But what we need to focus on is why that debt came to be, how the money was spent, and how this debt was a strategic play in order to cement AMC into the new era of cinema-streaming.

We can categorize the money used into four parts:

* **New equipment and amenities**
* **Lease payments**
* **Maintenance costs (utilities, wages, etc.)**
* **Expansion (buying out the competition)**

Pay close attention to the last category because this one is important. Over the past five years, AMC has been [acquiring smaller theater companies](https://tracxn.com/d/acquisitions/acquisitionsbyAMC-Theatres) like [Odeon](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/amc-theatres-closes-odeon-uci-acquisition-become-largest-exhibitor-europe-world-951348). After buying out these companies, AMC then had to suit its ""new locations"" with the standard luxury amenities AMC is known for. This makes for a significant bulk of their debt totaling over $3 billion in just acquisitions. This was the investment that helped **solidify AMCs spot as the world's largest cinema chain**.

On the topic of maintenance costs, AMC managed to raise enough money to [get through 2021](https://variety.com/2021/film/features/amc-ceo-adam-aron-coronavirus-bankruptcy-1234891440/). With ongoing news of vaccines, we can hope their efficacy leads to a speedy reopening near mid-late 2021. But when the economy *does* reopen—and AMC is back at full operation—what will it look like?

# III. The Future of AMC

There's an elephant here.. right in this very room. Yes, streaming and cinema have had some serious beef in the past. In fact, some cinema chains are having tensions with streaming to this day. But what has AMC done in regards to streaming? They were the first to[ settle deals](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/universal-amc-theatres-historic-deal-windows-1234718737/) in order to partner up and take part in streaming revenue.

*Yup, you read that right. AMC is both having their cake and eating it too.*

Why would motion picture companies do this? Why not just end the cinema industry? To put simply, analysts are deeply underestimating the value of the ""cinema experience"". Just as I mentioned in the intro, I miss the cinemas. But I am definitely not alone. But let's not talk about me and the hypothetical ""people'', instead let's talk about research studies.

In a 3-year study done in Korea, researchers found that shortening the window of cinema exclusivity and releasing movies on streaming early[ did **not** have a significant effect on ticket sales](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3749476). And though this is a limited study done outside of the US, remember that AMC is a global corporation and these results have a hopeful outlook for the future relationship of cinema-streaming for AMC worldwide.

*""But wait, you still haven't mentioned what streaming gets out of this?""*

It's not what streaming ""gets out of this"" but rather what these motion picture companies maintain in keeping a healthy relationship with cinemas. During the peak heat of the movie theater-streaming feud, AMC[ halted the showing of Trolls](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/amc-theatres-trolls-world-tour-dispute-1234592445/) and vowed to never show a Universal Pictures film in its theaters again if they were to continue releasing their films on streaming platforms without a proper cinema-exclusivity window. But today, we can see that the tensions have fallen and both motion picture companies and AMC have found a way to mutually benefit each other.

Now besides streaming, AMC has been investing in luxury amenities as seen by their chairs, 4K laser projectors,[ MERV air filtration](https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean), and ultra-surround sound speakers. With so many locations and so many amenities, they are offering [full theater rentals](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/amc-launches-private-theater-rental-program-111020.html) with high demand during the pandemic. AMC has further cultivated their century-old movie experience into modern times. And this pandemic didn’t just change their amenities.

They had to learn how to[ cut costs and have more efficient operations](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/amc-could-benefit-from-bankruptcy-analysts-say.html) in order to survive. This only spells good news for when they emerge with better operations, more money to spend, and higher valuations. So that begs the question, how high can the company's share price go realistically?

# IV. Valuation

First, let's look at the Movie Theater industry as a whole in comparison to a few other popular entertainment industries:

[Movie Theater US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/movie-theaters-united-states/) **$17.1 billion**

[Casinos US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/non-hotel-casinos-united-states/) $15.7 billion

[Amusement Parks US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/amusement-parks-united-states/) $14 billion

[Music Label Music Production US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/major-label-music-production-united-states/) $9.4 billion

[Music Publishing US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/music-publishing-united-states/) $7 billion

In the world of entertainment, cinema is a very lucrative business.

And, again, who is the largest movie theater chain in the world? Yup,[ AMC](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2020/12/11/amc-worlds-largest-movie-theater-chain-raises-100-million-lifeline-but-it-needs-750-million-to-survive-next-year/?sh=338d2b35257b).

Clueless CNBC dude mentioned that we retail traders[ don't trade with a fundamental reason](https://youtu.be/_KpecK1mvNo?t=1577) but is there a fundamental reason in shorting a $17 billion dollar industry GLOBAL leader down to its grave? Does AMC deserve to die? I surely don't think so.

Now I won't touch upon squeezes in this since I'm sure many of you folk have already read/heard enough about them, but I will leave this quick intuitive[ article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/investing/2021/01/27/short-squeezes-what-to-know/43360347/) about it. And yes, these shorts can and will be squoze once we have faith in our upper valuations and investors(we) begin buying again.

**And buy again we will**. As many users flee limp-dick Robinhood and join one of the real brokerages, their positions/funds will be settled and ready to trade come next week. Where do you think these angry RH refugees will be putting their investments? That's right, exactly into the positions that RH stopped them from buying last week: which includes $AMC.

If you were part of the RH user base and your plays were affected by the blatant market manipulation, it's not only ""not too late"", but I believe it is an opportune time to **BUY**.

How high can it go then? When will I know it's too late to take a position?

So when we talk about valuation, many people fear the uncertainty of a stock rising far past its current value. Well, I think Chamath Palihapitiya[ said it best](https://youtu.be/_KpecK1mvNo?t=1522):

***""Everybody that bought that stock is also underwriting how they want to own it.""***

In our current price-action environment, it's not too ridiculous to see how we are forming the foundations for AMC to continue rising beyond ATHs. We are already hitting nearly $16 on the day and rallying +53% while enduring heavy trade restrictions. Who's to say that this passion cannot continue? Now I’m no expert and can’t tell you how high this can go, but I am personally eyeing $69.69 as a target.

With so many current factors at play including hype, short covers, and ITM options having to be exercised, this is actually the BEST entrance to manifest its ATH valuation and chart some never before seen territory in its price action. **It's like the manifest destiny of stock valuation**. In fact, we may never see this opportunity for AMC again if we don't act now and solidify its value upward.

At the end of the day, prices are what the buyers/sellers settle upon so **WE** can pioneer that value if we damn well please. **This is what a free market is all about.**

*Will there be people that disagree with this?*

*Sure.*

Will people continue to short AMC as it goes up?

*Absolutely.*

Do I think that AMC being shorted 80% and rising is fair?

*Really? See section III.*

But institutions are selling off! Like [Silver Lake liquidating their 44m shares](https://www.barrons.com/articles/amc-entertainment-investor-silver-lake-sells-stake-51611962182).

*Yes, then the next day $AMC dipped to $7.50 and has since recovered…  with AMC $600m less in debt.*

We all know who is shorting AMC, and I am sick of these hedge funds who think they, alone, can decide whether or not a company is worth a damn.

# V. Conclusion - Resurgence

We are at the cusp of AMCs resurgence. Because most of us have been kept from participating in social activities, we can better understand that the public is yearning for a sense of normalcy. Sure we've gone pretty far with just watching movies on our TVs or computers through the pandemic, but that doesn't scratch the itch for many folk.

What you're investing into when you invest in AMC is the entire experience in tandem with its new streaming deals. And having been beaten so low—while still holding such great fundamental prospects— its share price is ready to blow up.

In the future when “The Deep Squeeze” is turned into a movie, we’ll be a part of history.

And you’re going to want to see it on the big screen.

From one disabled person to another please. Dont get me wrong. I am heavily invested in GME because I really like the stock. But...i do not think I will like the stock in 6+ months. I dont think GME will be worth 20bn in 6 months. After the squeeze...which might not happen...the share price could easily return to a significantly lower valuation. 

Why wouldnt the sqeeze happen? Well, only 20% of the outstanding public shares are owned by us little retard hands. That means the major price fluctuations are largely caused by massive hedge funds far larger than Melvin. We dont even know for sure that Melvin still holds the shorts. Another Mega Hedge could have bought them out and repositioned in a much better time frame. This fund could also be one of the major gamestop shareholders. What this means is that if the major shareholders decide to dump the stock will be left around 40-80 dollars a share at the current valuation.

Sticking it to the billionaires is the most room temperature IQ ""movement"" i have ever seen in my multiple years here and I congratulate each and every one of you retards for thinking thats whats happening. Most of the profits from this movement are going to go the hedge funds and insitutions that make Marvin captial look like your autistic son in the sand pit compared to your wifes boyfriend. 

The real kickers is that if they really do get left with 20-70 billion in debt they will most likely get bailed out by Mr. Rothschild and the fed and the American citizens will be left to pay back the debt with their tax dollars once again lining the pockets of billionaires.

TLDR: If you single brain cell ""investors"" are right and Melvin is stuck with a 70bn dollar bill the american peoples tax dollars will pay it and most of the profits will go to even larger cap hedge funds. Really sticking it to the billionaires retards. HOLD SHARES IN CASE I HAVE .5 brain cells and go long dated PUT options for when gamestop realizes its true market value.

Edit: Since I am in fact more than retarded, probably borderline Melvin, I need to mention that I would only play on these options during the supposed run up during the squeeze and hopefully sell during similar if not higher IV on the ride back down.

If you are have been locked in a basement for a while you may have missed that real-estate market has been hot. Low rates has made bored desperate housewifes think of buying a new house with a pool or second home where to go on a romantic weekend with their boyfriend. Try and buy a condo in a popular vacation spot like Miami. Condos are gone within a week of listing, sometimes within a day.

Mortgage rate is 3%, which makes owning a real-estate a great hedge against inflation. If inflation kicks in then the $300k condo today will be $400k in few years. And your house payment will be much lower in today’s money versus in 5 years.

**Mortgage numbers in 2020 gave been best ever**

December mortgage numbers 26% higher than year ago (Refi up 102% from last year)

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/mortgage-demand-from-homebuyers-spikes-28percent.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/mortgage-demand-from-homebuyers-spikes-28percent.html)

January mortgage numbers 16% higher than year ago

For the year, Loan Origination on volume grew 71% annually, but the data is even better, because if you consider the refi’s which do not add to the volume, **there was a 158% growth in refinancing YOY.**

[https://www.housingwire.com/articles/loan-officers-made-insane-money-in-q4-2020/](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/loan-officers-made-insane-money-in-q4-2020/)

If rates start to increase we may see even more refi efforts in 2021 to capture the low interest rates.

**Alright, so why Rocket Mortgage?**

Well it is often in the **top 3 best rated mortgage companies**. In addition, the company’s its primary focus is mortgages unlike Chase of BoA. So if mortgage numbers are good, then their numbers will be really good because their revenues is heavily depended on mortgages.

Brand recognition - It’s probably one of the most recognizable names for mortgages. Their website gets over 110 million visits per year. More than any other mortgage site.

They are innovative, they have developed a directory for all of the local mortgage brokers. Now this is interesting. They are listing the brokers and do not charge any fees for the leads to the brokers whether they work with Rocket Mortgage or not for the load. That’s lost revenue right? Well, I think that they are building a good relationship with the local brokers, so that the brokers can get the origination fee and then send them business back to get the loan via Rocket Mortgage.

**Share ownership**

They IPOd around $21.50, then went as high as $30m, and then dropped to $20 levels. **Short interest in Rocket Mortgage is 30%. But the leadership team owns 95% of the entire Rocket Companies** parent company. So this shows huge insider holding of this company, which clearly indicates their strong belief in this company. Check out their CEO’s message to the shorts [https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/29/rocket-companies-ceo-on-the-stocks-friday-surge.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/29/rocket-companies-ceo-on-the-stocks-friday-surge.html)

**Buzz**

There will be a buzz for rocket mortgage. They will have two superbowl ads this year to stay current and in people’s minds. This should play well with the time leading up to their earnings call which is coming up later in February. This can be a catalyst for the stock (it jumped last week to 23.50 with the whole shorts frenzy)

I have a good conviction on this company, but I am open to hear opposite views from you degenerates.

Positions 400 shares at $21.50. Thinking about some options too but don't have the balls to do a 30c 2/19 yet.

They’re also running trials in China and just finished phase 2. They will start phase 3 during THIS 1ST QUARTER. China also signed a $100 million deal with INO for the use of their COVID-19 vaccine. China has a HUGE market. 

This stock has been wrongfully manipulated to its core due to Hedge Fund/Big Pharma/FDA/ corruption.  This company can literally end the pandemic. Their phase 1 results show 100% efficacy rate for their COVID vaccine. It’s time for the squeeze. BUY AND HOLD. 💎 🤚

But  in this Holly War they started to make dirty steps like saying that other tickers like NOK or BB or SLV is bad idea. This is because they don't want to lose they money. And they don't care about money of other people that already have a deep looses.

Why I think that Nokia is a great idea for other few millions that didn't enter in GME in appropriate time. And this is a reasons:

1. During this year Nokia has taken only hold and buy ratings from all analysts including best performing. And it's not connected with WSB activity at all.
2. 3.3% of best performing individual investors started to buy Nokia. And this number is continually increasing.
3. Blogger sentiments is mostly bullish.
4. Company is based in Europe and it pretend to get profit from the expansion of the [5G market](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) in 2021. Most of all it could avoid cyber security issues in US and Europe markets in comparison with Chinese companies.
5. Nokia news sentiments is 86% bullish. There are plant of articles about 5G equipment
6. EPS was increased twice during this year (see below)
7. Dividend yield twice bigger than sector average: 1.86%, Sector Average: 0.93%
8. Nokia literally goes to the moon and pretend to be the first mobile network on the surface. Think about Space X and Virgin galactic success in this year and Catherine Wood space fund.

Its not data faking, its hedge funds hedging their shorts with calls and puts. Let me explain.

Gary Black is a guy to follow. Not always follow his advice or take everything for granted, but he gives a good insight into how hedge funds think: https://mobile.twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1356253412103512065

Gary has the opinion, that short sellers have hedged their short position by buying ATM calls and selling ATM puts that match the share count of its short. Ok, so lets run through this scenario:

1. Before expiration, the fund doesnt do anything, he has to pay the daily fee of the short interest on his shares and he loses value on his call as well as gains value on his put (because he sold it). This can draw out the short squeeze by month!
2. At expiration, if the share price is above purchase price, he can exercise the call, return the shares and the put expires worthless so he keeps the premium.
3. If the share price goes down, the call expires worthless but he buys shares with the put and returns these shares to close his short position.

In scenario 1, the short interest stays the same as nothing happens. But I can totally see the statistics to **reduce the reported short position because it is fully hedged!** In scenario 2, the call seller has to find the shares on the market. In scenario 3 its the same, but this time the put buyer has to find the shares.

**IN ALL 3 SCENARIOS, THE SHORT INTEREST STAYS THE SAME BUT THE REPORTED SHORT INTEREST GOES DOWN BECAUSE ITS SHOVED UNDER THE RUG OF THE OPTIONS TRADERS.**

Which means, the statistics might be correct, but the true short interest is still the same as before! **THE SHORTS ARE NOT OFF THE HOOK!**

No investment advice you monkeys! We have the shorts by the balls until they turn blue and fall off!

First up, I'm acting as a surrogate for u/BIO9999 as he can't post here yet but is absolutely brilliant and deserves to be heard.  He'll be around in the thread to answer questions

We are going to look at **Biocryst’s** recently approved drug **Berotralstat**, AKA **Orladeyo**. It is a **once-a-day pill** given to patients with a terrible lifelong disease called **Hereditary Angioedema**, that results in them having to **frequently visit the Emergency Room** for life-threatening angioedema attacks (check out Youtube for videos of HAE patients suffering from these attacks and using Berotralstat). It is estimated that this disease affects **1 in 50,000** people in the world, or roughly **140,000 people**, so although considered a rare disease, it is still affecting a **lot** of folks.

The available treatments for this disease are **all IV drugs** that are painful and produce local reactions. Berotralstat is the **first oral drug**. It achieved excellent results in phase 3 trials, and the US FDA gave it **fast track** status in 2018 and Japan gave it **Sakigake** status (type of fast track). Then **on December 3rd, the US granted approval for the drug**. They did it very importantly with **zero label** statements--meaning that they had no concerns about side effects or dangers. **On January 22nd, Japan granted approval**. The **EU** also met last week to discuss approval and will announce its result **this quarter**.

So let's look at what the above means for this stock. First the drug is in **HIGH** demand. In the US there are at least **10,000** people with HAE. Despite the disease being frequently debilitating, patients are so uncomfortable about getting regular injections that **only 7,500** are currently being treated with IV injections. The other 2,500 are going **untreated** despite the high risks. Now let's look at the 7,500 patients on a prophylactic treatment. Based on numerous surveys by doctors, the company, and researchers, most of these people would prefer an oral treatment. Take a look at this peer-reviewed survey article finding that [98% of IV prophylactic patients (the 7,500) would prefer an oral treatment and 96% of the non-prophylactic patients (the 2,500) would want an oral treatment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489436/).

No wonder then that one of the preeminent biotech analysts, Evercore's Liisa Bayko, wrote to her clients on December 4th that Berotralstat was likely to quickly **take at least 30% of the HAE market** based on Evercore surveys of patient and doctor demand.

Remember that this is **just the US**.... Japan did not even have any prophylactic treatment until Berotralstat was approved there a few days ago. They have **500 people registered with HAE** and estimated **2,000 ready to be registered**. [The UK is so desperate to add the drug for its patients, it did not even wait until the formal approval process to go through and gave early access to the drug on November 9th](https://angioedemanews.com/2020/11/09/berotralstat-available-to-eligible-patients-uk-through-early-access-program/#:~:text=Berotralstat%20%E2%80%94%20an%20oral%20therapy%20by,before%20its%20potential%20regulatory%20approval).

The EU is not far behind, with its estimated **20,000 patients**, with approval coming in the next few weeks. Then there is the rest of the world. The HAE patient population in **Latin America** is estimated by **HAE International**, the most important advocacy organization for HAE patients worldwide and one of **Berotralstat’s biggest supporters**, to be **over 15,000 patients**, the vast majority of whom are poorly diagnosed and not prophylactically treated. Argentina and Brazil have the highest actual diagnostic rates. HAEI through its Latin American sister organizations is strongly advocating for Berotralstat in Latin America.

Next, it should be noted that Biocryst built a **world-class sales team** for this drug in the US and EU and signed a **partnership with Torii in Japan** to take charge of the large sales and marketing promotion there. It has hired dozens of professionals, most from its HAE competitors. Its **vice-president** and US general manager **Allen Hodge** was even responsible for the **successful efforts of the HAE drug launches** of Cinryze and Firazyr, two pioneering injectable treatments for HAE. You could not get a more promising leader for this task.

It should also be pointed out that this drug, an oral kallikrein inhibitor, is potentially of **huge value for a host of diseases, including COVID-19** (that is now recognized to severely affect the kallikrein-kinin system, and kallikrein inhibitors have begun to be tested against COVID19--see this (IV) **kallikrein inhibitor trial that was just announced in Brazil** for instance: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/)), **diabetic macular edema** (which Biocryst just obtained a patent on a technique to administer kallikrein inhibitors for), many autoimmune diseases, and even some types of cancer.

Last but not least, how should this stock be valued based on this one drug? First, this drug is **one of the 10 most expensive drugs** (based on its annual cost of prescription) in the world, but still **less than the price of its IV competitors**, at $488,000 per patient per year. This drug is being approved by insurance companies **left, right, and center** as their preferred treatment, all you have to do is follow [R8](https://stocktwits.com/R8Plus) or [nickpd](https://stocktwits.com/nickpd) on Stocktwits to see how many insurance companies have been making it easy for patients to sign up for the drug. [Optime care even lets patients get direct-to-patient prescriptions now](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biocryst-scores-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-first-oral-option-to-prevent-hae-attacks).

So what does all this mean for sales? And why is the stock not valued based on just this drug alone (I will get to the others in **future posts**)? I **estimate conservatively** that by December 2021, there will be **over 6,000 patients on Berotralstat in the US, EU and Japan**, and I can share in a future post the graphs and calculations I made to get to those numbers. 6,000 patients annualized is up to **$2.9 billion in annual sales**. **Most** of this is going to be **profit**. At a **conservative price to sales ratio of 7**, that should produce a price of **$121, not $8.52**!  If you want to play around with the math yourself, look [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLvclUzTqCitwKfawL7kGCLquJxA2T7IJKLg52VWotE/edit?usp=sharing).

And that is **just the beginning**. Because Factor D and Galidesivir are going to be much bigger than Berotralstat for reasons I will explain in future posts. Remember that **its Factor D drug, which is showing superiority to all other anti-complement drugs in Phase I trials and was fast-tracked and given orphan status by the FDA and now is in Phase 2 though not officially announced by the company eyt,** and can be used in at least 20 diseases including common ones like Rheumatoid Arthritis, is currently **not even factoring into BCRX's valuation**. Consider that **Alexion with its significantly inferior anti-complement drug was just sold to Astra-Zeneca for $39 billion** because of the **recognized potential of anti-complement drugs** for a host of diseases. BCRX even has has **other drugs like Peramivir, already approved for Influenza and able to be used for the next bird flu pandemic, and its FOP drug--a story for another day**.

So why is this company, with **zero risk of dilution** due to an **amazing royalty deal** it signed in December and **three super-drugs** each worth tens of billions of dollars, and a host of other exciting developments to look forward to, **worth only $1.5 billion right now?** It can only be because the company's stock has been **relentlessly shorted in 2020 and 2021** to allow for significant accumulation by institutions. That is why the stock **only went up 168%**, yes ""***ONLY***"" **168%**...

The time for BCRX investors is **now**. My next post will be about Factor D, brace for that one. Factor D is 10 times bigger than Berotralstat! Good luck to all!

I am not the original poster I just think this DD was passed up so check it out!

So PENN owns barstool and sportsbooks, DKNG has daily fantasy and sports betting, and I think there are multiple reasons why buying calls would be good. The runup to the Superbowl, the increase in popularity of gambling/sports betting, and states will continue to legalize sportsbetting.

First off, the Superbowl is coming up on February 7th. You all know you are going to bet massive amounts this year with all your tendies. Mahomes and Brady is a huge draw. There is going to be record sports betting on the Superbowl which is going to signal massive growth for these companies.

Second, we've all become rich this year and have money to blow. We are the key demographic for sports gambling. Without a doubt we are going to see record inflows into sportsbetting in the future. It has the potential to be a trillion dollar industry.

Third, US states are dying for money right now. Cuomo has said he wants to legalize sports betting in NY to help raise revenue. That is a huge market and would be huge for PENN and DKNG. ([https://www.barrons.com/articles/draftkings-penn-national-jump-on-news-that-cuomo-supports-making-online-sports-betting-legal-51609984632?mod=article\_inline](https://www.barrons.com/articles/draftkings-penn-national-jump-on-news-that-cuomo-supports-making-online-sports-betting-legal-51609984632?mod=article_inline)). Here's a Cuomo quote from this article:

""New York has the potential to be the largest sports wagering market in the United States, and by legalizing online sports betting we aim to keep millions of dollars in revenue here at home, which will only strengthen our ability to rebuild from the \[Covid-19\] crisis.”

I mean it is a no brainer for these states to legalize sports betting for raising revenue. No reason why other states wouldn't feel the same way as NY.

Everyone has become gambling degens now with the GME short squeeze. We need our fix. Sportsbetting is going to have massive growth. The tailwind of the Superbowl and states legalizing are going to cause these stocks to moon.

Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.


Typical tactics include the following:

Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.

The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.

By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.

Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.


Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:

Media Assault -

The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.

The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.

One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This ""mistake"" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ""Due to a mathematical error"" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.

Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.

This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.


Analyst Reports -

Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned ""friendly"" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.

Planting moles in target companies -

The shorts plant ""moles"" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.

Frivolous SEC investigations -

The shorts ""leak"" tips to the SEC about ""corporate malfeasance"" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed ""confidential inquiry"" is leaked to the short media.

The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.

Class Action lawsuits -

Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.

Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. -

If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.


Pulling margin from long customers -

The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Click here for more on Pulling Margin).

Paid bashers -

The shorts will hire paid bashers who ""invade"" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher).

This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.

How Pervasive Is This?

At any given point in time more than 100 emerging companies are under attack as described above. This is not to be confused with the day-to-day shorting that occurs in virtually every stock, which is purportedly about thirty percent of the daily volume.

The success rate for short attacks is over ninety percent-a success being defined as putting the company into bankruptcy or driving the stock price to pennies. It is estimated that 1000 small companies have been put out of business by the shorts. Admittedly, not every small company deserves to succeed, but they do deserve a level playing field.

The secrecy that surrounds the shorts, the prime brokers, the DTC and the regulatory agencies makes it impossible to accurately estimate how much money has been stolen from the investing public by these predators, but the total is measured in billions of dollars.

Also not saying sell GME so get that “only GME matters” bullshit out of here!

To the point: SPCE “pleas fly again” isn’t flying right now in the real world, but SpaceX is and they’re bringing civilians. This is bringing a lot of attention to SPCE for a number of reasons and I think it’s an excellent catalyst opportunity for the following reasons:

1. This legitimizes commercial space travel to a great extent and it will bring this new category to the forefront of conversations for the coming weeks/months. To my understanding, virgin is not doing so badly in this department themselves, so it shouldn’t be challenging for them to get early adoption.

2. Short interest is high as shit. Contrary to what many of you have been taught, it does NOT take 100%+ short float to cause an epic squeeze. These happen all the time when black swans fuck up bear trades. GME was just the first time a community like our successfully triggered one. With that said, SPCE sits at 50%+ short interest, and was the third most shorted stock on the market following GME and AMC. The big difference is, unlike those two names that were recovery plays, this is an emerging business and is being shorted purely on valuation despite valuation being near impossible.

3. Valuing a stock like this is esoteric and I defined. This is a pre revenue company, but it’s one of the only players in a market that will be $30 billion+ by 2030 according to UBS. Let’s assume 33% market share and a 2.5x price to sales multiple (good airline average js around 1.6), then you’d get a $25 billion fair value in 2030. Given this thing will likely be growing much faster than any airline, and the fact that it’s balance sheet is fucking stacked $720+ mil cash vs around $40 mil in debt, this isn’t outrageously priced. A lot less risky than hoping GME somehow justifies a $30 Billion market cap (again, not bashing it, just rationalizing that this isn’t a crazy idea).

4. Low share count = high volatility. Not than many shares on the market, around 150 mil total and in the ballpark of 70 mil in the float. This baby could move, and, unlike a mature GME or AMC, you shouldn’t count on insider bailing considering this is super early in the growth curve. This means less surprises and less risky for big at the market capital raises. (Again, not bearish on either name, long live apes!)

5. People are fucking stupid. People buy the wrong ticker all the time. ZM vs ZOOM. Hell, I’m stupid, I bought the wrong ticker for Fisker, but so are other apes and I still made money! My dad even told me I need to add “SpaceX, symbols SPCE” months and months ago, and had no idea it was Virgin Galactic. I wouldn’t be shocked if half the people in the AH though this was SpaceX, hell, I wouldn’t be surprised if half of you reading this thought it was SpaceX.

In short, this seems like an excellent trade idea that’s primed for a short squeeze pop. That’s why I’m buying at least.

Truth is, I ain’t got the guts of steel to go into volatility like that. I wish all you brothers and sisters best of luck though. 

Right before the pandemic, Xerox traded at \~$38 dollars. The pandemic did affect their revenues, bopping it down to 7 billion annually, from the previous years 9 and some billion. 

This, along with pandemic stock battering, seems to have messed up Xerox’s valuation. Take a look at some of these numbers, which I pulled from tradingview. 

Market Cap: 4.48B

Total Assets: 14.741B

Total Debt: 4.86B

Free Cash Flow: 592M 

Gross Profit: 2.562B

This is all numbers from a pandemic battered year. I personally expect these numbers to go higher, given the end of the pandemic is now just perhaps half a year out. The stock trades right now, at $22.59. 

Let me do complete monkey math for a second: 14.741-4.86 = 9.881 =/= 4.48, not accounting the fact that they have a massive cash flow. To some extent the cash flows contribution can discounted, granted that they are a dividend stock with a yield somewhere near 4%. 

Xerox today also announced some business management shuffling, which is projected to boost growth and more clearly organize the business’s operations. I think their stock should thus have some incredible upside, both to us WSBers, and to those looking to invest in a sensible dividend stock. 

If you read this far, please share your thoughts too, this is basic numbers I’m sure you guys know more complex terms. 

This isn’t professional advice. 

Positions: I bought \~$600 of XRX calls for April, target $25. This is all I can afford till my next paycheck, when I’ll go in bigger. 

P.S. don’t expect anything related to a short squeeze, short% of float is small compared to what we are seeing."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082633.csv|DueDiligence|['XRX']|['XRX']|['GME', 'I', 'XRX', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'M', 'B', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'XRX', 'I', 'P', 'S']|['GME', 'XRX', 'XRX']

This is due to short ladder attacks done by hedge funds which is a form of market manipulation to lower the price artificially, scare us, and get us to sell our shares to them to cover.

We know this for two reasons.

1. Volume: The volume for the last couple trading days was quite low. What is volume? It’s the act of trading (buying and selling) shares for that day. Today, the volume was just not high enough to justify such a dip. The same thing is happening after hours where volume is MUCH lower because the US market doesn’t have access to the the stock. Low volume means low volatility. These dips were HIGH volatility, but with low volume, which means the high volatility cannot be explained by the low volume, but instead of a short ladder attack. 

2. Bid/Ask Gap: If you have access to Level 2 data on Robinhood Gols (which is free for the first month and 5 dollars every subsequent month), you will notice that expanding the stock chart will reveal the option to add extra data. Among this data is the Bid Ask chart. This chart simply shows you how many shares are ready to be sold at a certain price and how many shares are ready to be bought at a certain price. The Gap between them is the difference between the average bid (buyers) and ask (sellers). Today’s gap was a whopping 5 dollars which is quite big. The average gap would just be a few cents on normal trading days.

3. Some of you may think, “if they keep short laddering this, can’t they just keep doing it to cover their positions?” Well, they still have to buy shares from people and as we saw in the chart, even when the price fell, people massively bought as opposed to sold. Meaning every ladder attack leads to a huge upswing in price. The base for all this is around 100 dollars, it’s hard for it to go lower with all this attention, and a big whale will definitely eat that up. 

In the end, HOLD. The fundamentals and sympathy is on our side.

## First, the data:

on 1/29, [S3 reported](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20) that projected short interest was 113.31% of float with 57.83M shares shorted. Important to note is that this data represents their estimates for END OF DAY ON 1/28.

on 2/1, [Ihor Dusaniwsky](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356261806612885509?s=20) S3's managing director of predictive analytics reported that projected short interest was 53.15% of float with 27.12M shares shorted. This data represents their estimates for END OF DAY ON 1/29

This means that shorts had to purchase at least 30.71M shares on Friday total (including pre and post market trading).

On Friday, we saw a trading volume of 50.25M [source](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?p=GME)

 ## What does this mean?
The data stands up to the test of basic math. There WAS enough trading volume on Friday for shorts to cover and GME ended the day up about $120 / share.

## Conclusions and Opinions (NOT DATA)

I suspect that most of the older shorts have in fact covered on Friday. Retail was still heavily limited in volume due to Robinhood and other broker trading restrictions, and I doubt retail had enough fuel on their own to explain the rise in price on Friday. It is fully possible that AT THE CURRENT MOMENT we won't have another short squeeze. I closed my GME positions this morning at $250 due to a relatively high cost basis and seeing that there is some truth to shorts covering. If short interest picks up again and the price dips low enough, I may re-enter. Y'all probably think I'm paper handed, but I did what I thought was best given my current situation. If I had actually gotten in back when it was sub $100, I might have been a lot more comfortable holding.

Some people will probably say that 50%+ short interest is pretty high, however I currently suspect most of those shorts entered their positions above the $300 mark, and thus can handle a lot of pain before they are squoze. Retail would need to drive the price up significantly on their own before we see more squeeze IMO.

I'm a retard, don't take financial advice from me.

See the chart linked above. This is why the current price of $GME is a misleading indicator of the actual situation at hand. The turquoise/salmon bars at the bottom indicate the volume traded. The chart starts on Jan 11th on the left and ends with today, Feb 1st on the right. Today was the lowest volume traded since this whole rocket ship really started blasting off. The price movements from today were most likely from ladder attacks trying to trigger a panic sell.

Additionally, the thin green bars at the bottom are a Squeeze Momentum indicator (measures volatility). The squeeze officially started on Jan 13th and has been building momentum steadily over the past two weeks. It appears that the pressure is building.

Before reading my take on the subject, [please go read u/johnnydaggers take before. It's the most interesting thing I've read this week-end](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)


💎 **STATUS QUO** 💎


In a game of musical chairs slowing down because of a drying liquidity, both parties may be stuck for a while in an inconfortable position. Shorts are experiencing a slow burn paying interests for their borrowed shares and Longs might feel discouraged with a sense of injustice turning odds against them (especially retail investors).
The problem is, paid interests are marginal (millions) when that could be much much worse with an ever increasing percentage of longs which has been quite halted since last Thursday. Shorts are then playing against the clock hoping for some backup by the SEC simply freezing the trade of $GME for ten days or more, killing momentum and scaring people away --> papers hands flying in the eye of the storm. 

What can we do other than buying more shares and holding? Most of us are out of ammo and holding has its limitations too. We've gone a long way, me might have already landed in the moon unknowingly but I know we all aim for more.
But lets be realistic for a second, we've just invaded Dirty Money People playground and they know every corner of it. We may be in a strong position regarding $GME, but we don't drive the narrative for the remaining 99.99% of the stock market. Shorts still can make big bucks elsewhere, even though they have to liquidate their assets to fund our Nintendos, Teslas, dildo shaped rockets to effing Mars, etc. 

SHARES DON'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE. Yes we already know.
SHORTED SHARES DON'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE. Ok we know that too, they *only* have interests to pay.

What do we do to **FORCE** them to buy those shares NEXT WEEK?
What has always been our weapon of choice?
Last week we were too much focused on owning our shares and holding that we collectively agreed that options were not the best way to trigger the MOASS. The plan was followed religiously and that's still an advantage.


💎 **What my only wrinkle whispered to me while in bed this morning** 💎

⠀
As you retards already now, ITM options can be exercised for shares : 100xcontracts you own.
Meaning, past the expiration date, those shares HAVE TO be bought within the following week and given to you lucky retards.
Unfortunately, right now, one single of those safe contract cost so much that most of us can't afford it anymore.
*Wrote this half assed DD this morning and it seems like options buying has been made difficult in several brokerages, meaning they don't want us to go this way...*

NOW we need bigger fishes to light a fire so hot Shorts would not have time to lose their shirts but cook instantly! We need rich kids and mad billionaires!

IF we collectively hold and harden our diamonds hands even more in this week to come, and have rich troopers coming to buy every single deep ITM and ITM calls there is, next week is going to trigger the biggest chain reaction and propel us so fast that we could attain light speed in a snap and reach $69,420.69 ☮️


💎 **PAPA MUSK, if you are reading this poorly made DD, don't buy shares, buy far ITM options to force their hands and make us 0.001% as rich as you!! I'll definitely buy a Tesla if it goes higher than $6000** 💎

You don't need to convince anybody to hold their shares; have confidence and hold strong, here is why:

Today we shook all of the paper hands. I repeat: TODAY WE SHOOK ALL OF THE PAPER HANDS. Every single mf holding the stock has💎 **diamond**  💎 hands and will not sell. **DFV is still in**, I'm still in, we are STILL IN. We have created a moat.

Potential upcoming catalysts:

* Potential announcements from gamestop regarding their outlook and business plans
* More celebrity shoutouts and support by the day.
* ITM calls from friday must be settled tomorrow at the latest
* Legal developments (ie SEC involvement, congressional hearings)
* More people realizing silver is a fucking scam.
* WSB subscribers up to 8 million (was 6-7 million last week) and continuing to rise this week.
* Official/reliable government short data released feb 9 or something

&#x200B;

**Addressing doubts:**

* According to some sources, the short percentage has dropped:

We don't know the actual short percentage. All numbers we have are estimates, which can easily be manipulated by shorters with various tactics (using options, etc) or methodology changes (not accounting synthetic longs, etc). Even if we do accept the data from S3, the short squeeze thesis is not contested or done-- as long as people hold the shorts still lose money whether they have an absurdly pants-on-fire high amount, or a lower but still insanely high amount. The true ""float"" of shares gets lower and lower as more and more diamond hands enter at dips. It is even possible to short squeeze at 10% (and lower) if nobody sells and buying ramps up due to some catalysts. Keep in mind they could add more shorts today or at any time if they believe we are losing momentum.

&#x200B;

* What if the whales rug pull us? (or some shady under-the-table deal, etc)

&#x200B;

The whales want to make money too, and they make the most money off of volatility and GME staying high and popular. They have the retail data, they read wsb. They know you fucks ain't selling. If they wanted us to tank the price would already be 40. They would never let short sellers off the hoo knowing they could squeeze them dry.

&#x200B;

* What if shorts never give up and continue to lower the price?

I don't know about you but I believe in the stubbornness of our community of apes (which lose nothing from holding) more than hedge funds which are losing money daily. They don't want to tie up capital on losing trades for such an extended period of time.

&#x200B;

* ""Veterans"" and people with ""concerns""

Likely holding puts or have no better idea wtf is happening than you do. What do they hope they accomplish with these ""concerns""? Are they helping you by trying to spark a panic sell?

&#x200B;

Welcome people's doubts with open arms and offer your rebuttals: our community has a diamond will.

These are just my dumb thoughts, godspeed apes.

**Summary** 🚀🚀

XL fleet is a company primarily involved with the electrification of commercial fleet vehicles across the US.  This company aims to reduce carbon emissions by vehicles by fitting vehicles with electric components to transform gas powered vehicles into hybrids.

**The players**🚀🚀

Tod Hynes- The founder and president of XL Fleet who currently is a senior professor at MIT, where he lectures a graduate course, Energy Ventures. He also co-founded the MIT Clean Energy Prize.

Dimitri Kazarinoff- Current CEO of XL fleet. He is an accomplished transportation industry executive who has led impressive growth, expansion and innovation throughout his career. Prior to joining XL as CEO, Dimitri successfully scaled the hybrid power systems division of Eaton Corporation by 15x within two years.  He also has worked at General Motors.

Needless to say, the current leadership of XL fleet has decades of experience not only in Clean Energy, but also in leadership and expansion.

**Application**🚀🚀

The Implementation of electric components to vehicles is no doubt extremely beneficial to both the customer and the environment. Here’s how:

- XL’s hybrid electric  drive system improves vehicle MPG by up to 25% and reduces CO2 emissions by up to 20% for Class 2-6 fleets.

- Their Plug-In drive system improved vehicle MPG by up to 50% and reduces CO2 emissions by 33% in Ford F-150 and F-250 pickup trucks.

- XL grid is XL’s charging and power stations, and simultaneously function as driving data site analysis and solar power sites. 

These figures are pretty impressive, and saving the consumer money via gasoline consumption and saving the environment via reduced CO2 emissions is a win-win.

** Other Info**🚀🚀

- On Jan 21, 2021 XL fleet was named one of the Top 100 Impact Companies by Real Leaders Magazine

- Partners with GM and Ford, along with other well-established and successful companies such as Coca-Cola. 

- The US government will replace its entire fleet of 645,000 cars and trucks with US-made electric vehicles, president Joe Biden said on Jan. 25, while signing a “Buy America” executive order that creates new guidelines for the government’s $600 billion in annual spending on goods and services.  XL fleet can capitalize on this opportunity to further expand their operations and boost their publicity

🚀🚀- This stock is currently over 70% shorted with a low float (~8,000,000). Now this is not the next GME by any means, but I believe that the foundation that this company has and the fact that the Biden Administration is focusing so heavily on EV will drive this stock upward quickly. 🚀🚀

**TLDR**

XL fleet is poised to rocket to the stratosphere based on its foundation, application under the Biden administration, and its partnerships (All mentioned above).  Couple this with its low float and high short percentage (70%+) and we’ve got ourselves an early boarding pass to Alpha  Centauri. 

Alright retards, resume brandishing those pitchforks and rage on against Robinhood, Citadel, Melvin, and 🏳️‍🌈🐻, but do so with XL fleet in mind.  

Giraffe out.

Positions- 200 shares and several 8/20 25c

What’s Happened the Past Few Days?: The Anatomy of a Short Ladder Attack

Published courtesy of Citizens for Securities Reform, at http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html

Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.


Typical tactics include the following:

Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.

The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.

By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.

Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.


Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:

Media Assault -

The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.

The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.

One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This ""mistake"" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ""Due to a mathematical error"" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.

Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.

This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.


Analyst Reports -

Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned ""friendly"" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.

Planting moles in target companies -

The shorts plant ""moles"" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.

Frivolous SEC investigations -

The shorts ""leak"" tips to the SEC about ""corporate malfeasance"" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed ""confidential inquiry"" is leaked to the short media.

The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.

Class Action lawsuits -

Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.

Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. -

If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.


Pulling margin from long customers -

The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Click here for more on Pulling Margin).

Paid bashers -

The shorts will hire paid bashers who ""invade"" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher).

This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.

How Pervasive Is This?

At any given point in time more than 100 emerging companies are under attack as described above. This is not to be confused with the day-to-day shorting that occurs in virtually every stock, which is purportedly about thirty percent of the daily volume.

The success rate for short attacks is over ninety percent-a success being defined as putting the company into bankruptcy or driving the stock price to pennies. It is estimated that 1000 small companies have been put out of business by the shorts. Admittedly, not every small company deserves to succeed, but they do deserve a level playing field.

The secrecy that surrounds the shorts, the prime brokers, the DTC and the regulatory agencies makes it impossible to accurately estimate how much money has been stolen from the investing public by these predators, but the total is measured in billions of dollars. The problem is also international in scope"|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|['GME']|['GME']|['DTC', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'ATM', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'USA', 'CNBC', 'A', 'USA', 'TASER', 'USA', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'A', 'DTC']|[]

I decided to double-check my original BB DD, as a way to remind myself of why I invested in the first place. From my point of view, nothing has changed in the fundamentals, and I am still very well satisfied with my investment.

Currently, I have 410 stocks, with an average buy-in of $17,62 per stock.

Before getting down to the good stuff, I just want to point out that **this is in no way financal advice**, neither do I take any responsibility for your financial choices based on my text. I'm just your average happy amateur.

**THE PHONE COMPANY THAT SWITCHED TO IoT AND CYBER SECURITY**

For starters, you can't really exclusively call Blackberry a phone company anymore. They've switched their main focus to Cyber Security and IoT. Today, BB provides solutions for Unified Endpoint Security, Penetration Testing, Ransomware Protection and Blackberry QNX (remember that last one, because it's important).

In December of 2020, a massive attack occured against SolarWinds, a major IT firm that provides software for entities ranging from Fortune 500 companies to the US government. The US agencies in question that got attacked were: parts of the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and the Treasury.

However, **not a single of BlackBerry's customers were affected by the hack**.

**BLACKBERRY QNX**

Blackberry owns and develops the closed source QNX operating system, which is a real-time operating system (meaning that it can process data without buffer delays). If you have a smartphone or a car, chances are that in one way or another, it runs with QNX embedded.

Read more about QNX [here](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-150-million-vehicles).

**PARTNERSHIP WITH BAIDU, XPENG and GAC GROUP: EV-INDUSTRY IN CHINA**

Just like in other developed parts of the world, it's springtime for the electrical vehicle-market in China. You might have heard about some of their most successful brands: NIO, BAIDU, XPENG and GAC group.

NIO has a market cap of **$61.6 bn**, XPENG has a market cap of **$31.5 bn**, Baidu has a market cap of **$80,16**, and GAC group has a market cap of a whooping **$114,7 bn**.

Why is this good for Blackberry?

1. In August 2020, BB announced that they will be *""powering the Level 3 driving domain controller of Xpeng""* using... you guessed it! **QNX!**
2. A couple of weeks ago, BB announced that they would deepen their partnership with Chinese GAC Group, who amongst other things make electric cars. I read an article from a couple of days ago claiming that *""Future GAC electric cars will get BlackBerry driving assistance technology""* using... you guessed it! **QNX!**
3. Since April 2019, GAC group and NIO (the other EV maker) has had a joint venture in the form of the brand ""Hycan"", an electric car manufacturer. It's not farfetched to believe that there is a good chance of the Hycans to have QNX embedded as well.

**PARTNERSHIP WITH AMAZON**

As you all probably already know, Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce and cloud platform company. BlackBerry recently partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to launch a new connected vehicle platform that merges BlackBerry's QNX operating system with AWS's IoT services.

AWS launched its IoT platform in 2015. At the time, Amazon stated that it would make it easier for developers to create apps that link to myriad IoT gadgets, including smart speakers, home appliances, wearables, and connected cars. AWS is already the world's top cloud platform, so it makes perfect sense to integrate its IoT service into the most widely used embedded operating system for connected cars.

By linking QNX to the cloud, automakers can instantly monitor a vehicle's EV battery levels and vehicle subsystems, provide over-the-air software updates, and personalize vehicle cockpits,  advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and machine learning models for autonomous driving through cloud-based apps.

This reinforces BlackBerry's market-dominating position in embedded operating systems for connected cars, which also circles back to BB's endevours on the Chinese EV-market.

**PROJECT KUIPER**

I want to warn you all that this next part is purely speculation on my part.

From Wikipedia:  **Kuiper Systems LLC** is a subsidiary of Amazon that was set up in 2019 to deploy a large broadband satellite internet constellation to provide broadband internet connectivity. The deployment is also referred to by its project name ""**Project Kuiper**"". Amazon announced that it would be investing $10 billion in this project to deploy the satellite internet constellation.

How could BB fit into this thing?

Well, here's my hypothesis:

Why would Amazon start a long-term partnership with BlackBerry? Well, because BlackBerry has competency that Amazon lacks in-house of course. If Amazon wants to send satellites to space, why wouldn't they use Blackberry, when QNX has already been used in rockets by NASA and SpaceX?

Although there isn't any concrete evidence for my claims about BB and Project Kuiper, I personally don't believe that my thougts are way ""out there"". I guess time will tell if I'm right, but it's what I'm betting on!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TL;DR:

* BB's QNX operating system could become huge during 2021 due to BB's involvement with Amazon and Chinese EV-manufacturers.
* BB could play an important part in Project Kuiper"|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['I', 'BB', 'I', 'BB', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'THE', 'PHONE', 'MPANY', 'THAT', 'TCHED', 'TO', 'T', 'AND', 'CYBER', 'T', 'BB', 'QNX', 'IT', 'US', 'US', 'BERRY', 'QNX', 'QNX', 'QNX', 'RSHIP', 'WITH', 'BAIDU', 'XPENG', 'GAC', 'USTRY', 'IN', 'NIO', 'BAIDU', 'XPENG', 'GAC', 'NIO', 'XPENG', 'GAC', 'BB', 'QNX', 'A', 'BB', 'GAC', 'I', 'GAC', 'QNX', 'GAC', 'NIO', 'EV', 'QNX', 'RSHIP', 'WITH', 'QNX', 'T', 'AWS', 'T', 'T', 'AWS', 'T', 'QNX', 'EV', 'OJECT', 'I', 'BB', 'QNX', 'NASA', 'X', 'BB', 'I', 'I', 'QNX', 'BB']|['NIO', 'NIO', 'NIO']

The price currently does not matter AT ALL - if anything, this is a plus. Just buy and diamond hand this. Citadel is currently hurting and desperate including other big firms shorting GME (keep in mind some big whales are still holding stocks for GME). What we saw today was the most obvious attempt at ping ponging the stocks between the shorters causing the price to fall even at such low volumes - Almost a disgrace to call this a volume, as it was almost no volume. Check out [tradingview.com](https://tradingview.com) for example.  The price is not reflective of the situation at all. And remember, why are all these things happening?

&#x200B;

\- Tons of bots promoting anything other than GME.

\- Tons of news saying WSB was responsible for a surge in SLV and an apparent squeeze which will NEVER happen. Citadel holdst the 6th most shares in SLV.

\- Tons of TV-news reporting the same

\- The stock being sold way undervalue between hedge funds that have shorted the stock by over 110%.

\- Portraying us as lazy, greedy,  irrational and Alt-right people promoting GME

Do not fucking flinch. This was the most transparent the hedge funds has ever been by showing blatantly that they are naked-short selling and spam ping ponging the stocks. Fuck the funds and fuck the SEC. This is fucking it. Holding till 0 even though that is not possible.

Im not a financial advisor this is mot advice. Just a detailed explanation of what i believe could be going on. This is not my words it is from an article. When i posted the link it was getting deleted so i posted the most important part


The Creation of Counterfeit Shares — There are a variety of names that the securities industry has dreamed up that are euphemisms for counterfeit shares. Don't be fooled : Unless the short seller has actually borrowed a real share from the account of a long investor, the short sale is counterfeit. It doesn't matter what you call it and it may become non–counterfeit if a share is later borrowed, but until then, there are more shares in the system than the company has sold.


The magnitude of the counterfeiting is hundreds of millions of shares every day, and it may be in the billions. The real answer is locked within the prime brokers and the DTC. Incidentally, counterfeiting of securities is as illegal as counterfeiting currency, but because it is all done electronically, has other identifiers and industry rules and practices, i.e. naked shorts, fails–to–deliver, SHO exempt, etc. the industry and the regulators pretend it isn't counterfeiting. Also, because of the regulations that govern the securities, certain counterfeiting falls within the letter of the rules. The rules, by design, are fraught with loopholes and decidedly short on allowing companies and investors access to information about manipulations of their stock.


The creation of counterfeit shares falls into three general categories. Each category has a plethora of devices that are used to create counterfeit shares.
Fails–to–Deliver — If a short seller cannot borrow a share and deliver that share to the person who purchased the (short) share within the three days allowed for settlement of the trade, it becomes a fail–to–deliver and hence a counterfeit share; however the share is transacted by the exchanges and the DTC as if it were real. Regulation SHO, implemented in January 2005 by the SEC, was supposed to end wholesale fails–to–deliver, but all it really did was cause the industry to exploit other loopholes, of which there are plenty (see 2 and 3 below).
Since forced buy–ins rarely occur, the other consequences of having a fail–to–deliver are inconsequential, so it is frequently ignored. Enough fails–to–deliver in a given stock will get that stock on the SHO list, (the SEC's list of stocks that have excessive fails–to–deliver) – which should (but rarely does) see increased enforcement. Penalties amount to a slap on the wrist, so large fails–to–deliver positions for victim companies have remained for months and years.


A major loophole that was intentionally left in Reg SHO was the grandfathering in of all pre–SHO naked shorting. This rule is akin to telling bank robbers, “If you make it to the front door of the bank before the cops arrive, the theft is okay.”
Only the DTC knows for certain how many short shares are perpetual fails–to–deliver, but it is most likely in the billions. In 1998, REFCO, a large short hedge fund, filed bankruptcy and was unable to meet margin calls on their naked short shares. Under this scenario, the broker dealers are the next line of financial responsibility. The number of shares that allegedly should have been bought in was 400,000,000, but that probably never happened. The DTC — owned by the broker dealers — just buried 400,000,000 counterfeit shares in their system, where they allegedly remain — grandfathered into “legitimacy” by the SEC. Because they are grandfathered into “legitimacy”, the SEC, DTC and prime brokers pretend they are no longer fails–to–deliver, even though the victim companies have permanently suffered a 400 million share dilution in their stock.


Three months prior to SHO, the aggregate fails–to–deliver on the NASDAQ and the NYSE averaged about 150 million shares a day. Three months after SHO it dropped by about 20 million, as counterfeit shares found new hiding places (see 2 and 3 below). It is noteworthy that aggregate fails–to–deliver are the only indices of counterfeit shares that the DTC and the prime brokers report to the SEC. The bulk of the counterfeiting remains undisclosed, so don't be deceived when the SEC and the industry minimize the fails–to–deliver information. It is akin to the lookout on the Titanic reporting an ice cube ahead.
Ex–clearing counterfeiting — The second tier of counterfeiting occurs at the broker dealer level. This is called ex–clearing. Multiple tricks are utilized for the purpose of disguising naked shorts that are fails–to–deliver as disclosed shorts, which means that a share has been borrowed. They also make naked shorts “invisible” to the system so they don't become fails–to–deliver, which is the only thing the SEC tracks.
Some of the tricks are as follows:
Stock sales are either a long sale or a short sale. When a stock is transacted the broker checks the appropriate box. By mismarking the trading ticket –checking the long box when it is actually a short sale the short never shows up, unless they get caught, which doesn't happen often. The position usually gets reconciled when the short covers.
Settlement of stock transactions is supposed to occur within three days, at which time a naked short should become a fail–to–deliver, however the SEC routinely and automatically grants a number of extensions before the naked short gets reported as a fail–to–deliver. Most of the short hedge funds and broker dealers have multiple entities, many offshore, so they sell large naked short positions from entity to entity. Position rolls, as they are called, are frequently done broker to broker, or hedge fund to hedge fund, in block trades that never appear on an exchange. Each movement resets the time clock for the naked position becoming a fail–to–deliver and is a means of quickly getting a company off of the SHO threshold list.
The prime brokers may do a buy–in of a naked short position. If they tell the short hedge fund that we are going to buy–in at 3:59 EST on Friday, the hedge fund naked shorts into their own buy–in (or has a co–conspirator do it) and rolls their position, hence circumventing Reg SHO.
Most of the large broker dealers operate internationally, so when regulators come in (they almost always “call ahead”) or compliance people come in (ditto), large naked positions are moved out of the country and returned at a later date.


The stock lend is enormously profitable for the broker dealers who charge the short sellers large fees for the “borrowed” shares, whether they are real or counterfeit. When shares are loaned to a short, they are supposed to remain with the short until he covers his position by purchasing real shares. The broker dealers do one–day lends, which enables the short to identify to the SEC the account that shares were borrowed from. As soon as the report is sent in, the shares are returned to the broker dealer to be loaned to the next short. This allows eight to ten shorts to borrow the same shares, resetting the SHO–fail–to–deliver clock each time, which makes all of the counterfeit shares look like legitimate shares. The broker dealers charge each short for the stock lend.


Margin account buyers, because of loopholes in the rules, inadvertently aid the shorts. If short A sells a naked short he has three days to deliver a borrowed share. If the counterfeit share is purchased in a margin account, it is immediately put into the stock lend and, for a fee, is available as a borrowed share to the short who counterfeited it in the first place. This process is perpetually fluid with multiple parties, but it serves to create more counterfeit shares and is an example of how a counterfeit share gets “laundered” into a legitimate borrowed share.


Margin account agreements give the broker dealers the right to lend those shares without notifying the account owner. Shares held in cash accounts, IRA accounts and any restricted shares are not supposed to be loaned without express consent from the account owner. Broker dealers have been known to change cash accounts to margin accounts without telling the owner, take shares from IRA accounts, take shares from cash accounts and lend restricted shares. One of the prime brokers recently took a million shares from cash accounts of the company's founding investors without telling the owners or the stockbroker who represented ownership. The shares were put into the stock lend, which got the company off the SHO threshold list, and opened the door for more manipulative shorting.
This is a sample of tactics used. For a company that is under attack, the counterfeit shares that exist at this ex–clearing tier can be ten or twenty times the number of fails–to–deliver, which is the only category tracked and policed by the SEC.


Continuous Net Settlement — The third tier of counterfeiting occurs at the DTC level. The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) is a holding company owned by the major broker dealers, and has four subsidiaries. The subsidiaries that are of interest are the Depository Trust Company (DTC) and the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC). The DTC has an account for each broker dealer, which is further broken down to each customer of that broker dealer. These accounts are electronic entries. Ninety seven percent of the actual stock certificates are in the vault at the DTC with the DTC nominee's name on them. The NSCC processes transactions, provides the broker dealers with a central clearing source, and operates the stock borrow program.


When a broker dealer processes the sale of a short share, the broker dealer has three days to deliver a borrowed share to the purchaser and the purchaser has three days to deliver the money. In the old days, if the buyer did not receive his shares by settlement day, three days after the trade, he took his money back and undid the transaction. When the stock borrow program and electronic transfers were put in place in 1981, this all changed. At that point the NSCC guaranteed the performance of the buyers and sellers and would settle the transaction even though the seller was now a fail–to–deliver on the shares he sold. The buyer has a counterfeit share in his account, but the NSCC transacts it as if it were real.


At the end of each day, if a broker dealer has sold more shares of a given stock than he has in his account with the DTC, he borrows shares from the NSCC, who borrows them from the broker dealers who have a surplus of shares. So far it sounds like the whole system is in balance, and for any given stock the net number of shares in the DTC is equal to the number of shares issued by the company.
The short seller who has sold naked – he had no borrowed shares – can cure his fail–to–deliver position and avoid the required forced buy–in by borrowing the share through the NSCC stock borrow program.
Here is the hocus pocus that creates millions of counterfeit shares.


When a broker dealer has a net surplus of shares of any given company in his account with the DTC, only the net amount is deducted from his surplus position and put in the stock borrow program. However the broker dealer does not take a like number of shares from his customer's individual accounts. The net surplus position is loaned to a second broker dealer to cover his net deficit position.
Let's say a customer at the second broker dealer purchased shares from a naked short seller — counterfeit shares. His broker dealer “delivers” those shares to his account from the shares borrowed from the DTC. The lending broker dealer did not take the shares from any specific customers' account, but the borrowing broker dealer put the borrowed shares in specific customer's accounts. Now the customer at the second prime broker has “real” shares in his account. The problem is it's the same “real” shares that are in the customer's account at the first prime broker.
The customer account at the second prime broker now has a “real” share, which the prime broker can lend to a short who makes a short sale and delivers that share to a third party. Now there are three investors with the same counterfeit shares in their accounts.
Because the DTC stock borrow program, and the debits and credits that go back and forth between the broker dealers, only deals with the net difference, it never gets reconciled to the actual number of shares issued by the company. As long as the broker dealers don't repay the total stock borrowed and only settle their net differences, they can “grow” a company's issued stock.


This process is called Continuous Net Settlement (CNS) and it hides billions of counterfeit shares that never make it to the Reg. SHO radar screen, as the shares “borrowed” from the DTC are treated as a legitimate borrowed shares.
For companies that are under attack, the counterfeit shares that are created by the CNS program are thought to be ten or twenty times the disclosed fails–to–deliver, and the true CNS totals are only obtained by successfully serving the DTC with a subpoena. The SEC doesn't even get this information. The actual process is more complex and arcane than this, but the end result is accurately depicted.
Ex–clearing and CNS counterfeiting are used to create an enormous reserve of counterfeit shares. The industry refers to these as “strategic fails–to–deliver.” Most people would refer to these as a stockpile of counterfeit shares that can be used for market manipulation. One emerging company for which we have been able to get or make reasonable estimates of the total short interest, the disclosed short interest, the available stock lend and the fails–to–deliver, has fifty “buried” counterfeit shares for every fail–to–deliver share, which is the only thing that the SEC tracks, consequently the SEC has not acted on shareholder complaints that the stock is being manipulated.

The Anatomy of a Short Attack — Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.
The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.
When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.


Typical tactics include the following:
Flooding the offer side of the board — Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.


The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.


By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of “strategic fails-to-deliver” and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will “mask” the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.


Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other “success” parameters, the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands — all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.


Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called “crashing” the stock and a successful “crash” is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash “stick” or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:
Media assault — The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately purchase real shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These real shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.


The shorts have “friendly” reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the “friendly” reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.


One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair — proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This “mistake” was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation “Due to a mathematical error” appeared three days later — after the damage was done to the stock price.
Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:
When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fictionâ€¦ you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down — it's a pretty good game.


This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air, however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.


Analyst Reports — Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned “friendly” media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.


Planting moles in target companies — The shorts plant “moles” inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.
Frivolous SEC investigations — The shorts “leak” tips to the SEC about “corporate malfeasance” by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed “confidential inquiry” is leaked to the short media.


The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.
Class Action lawsuits — Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.
Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. — If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.
Pulling margin from long customers — The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover.
Paid bashers — The shorts will hire paid bashers who “invade” the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation.

This is not every dirty trick that the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.

TL;DR
These funds will short sell the same shares over and over increasing the amount of “conterfeit shares” and they will use all their power to use media to divert attention from illegal activities

I'm pretty sure most investors would.

I know  everyone is looking for the big squeeze and you fucking retarded apes have done fantastic holding the line, however, there is a great long term story about to unfold here.  The current tradeable float is probably less than 10 million shares, more than likely closer to 5 million.  The institutions own over 100% and the current BUY AND HOLD strategy is working like a charm.  The hedge funds, market makers and brokerages have engaged in criminal activity to hold the stock down.  My point is, the company and Cohen hasn't said a word due to earnings coming up 3/25/21.  Just think what the stock might do if/when CEO Sherman steps aside and they announce Cohen as CEO.  Then Cohen announces his plan of how he's going to transform the company.

Many people don't seem to realize it, but no smart investors put all their eggs into one basket.

I've got multiple large bets going at any given time, this way, if one doesn't work out, I can always bank on another one.

&#x200B;

That said, here's why I decided to put 100k into $NOK.

*This is not financial advice, do your own DD.*

&#x200B;

Let's start with financials:

The company has been working to grow FCF (Free cash flow) for the past couple of years and have delivered 5 quarters of positive FCF so far. Expected to continue this quarter.

Their operating margins have improved from breakeven in 2018 to just over 9% in 2020.

They are siting on a total cash balance of **over 8 billion dollars.**

The market cap is 23 billion dollars. To put this in perspective. You're paying 4.90$ per share for 1.92$ in Cash + Nokia's assets.

The company's expected to reinstate their dividend.

We're paying \~1x sales to buy the company.

The board is authorized to issue or buy back up to 10% of the float. They have done neither.

&#x200B;

**The other reasons:**

The Covid pandemic has actually accellerated spending on 5G infrastructure. $NOK and Ericsson have been large beneficiaries of this due to the security risks related to Huauei.

$NOK's reefshark chips help carriers reduce their costs (power demand is 64% lower for example). This has helped them sell more of their products, but they don't expect full adoption until 2022.

$NOK's been investing their money into R&D as well as into turning things around. They aren't just sitting on the side, they are working to become a major player again.

Total addressable market for this is expected to be $700 billion by 2030. It's currently $10 billion.

This is a 70x increase in addressable market, for which there are only a few major players.

**The biggest risk:** Huauei is unbanned from use in the US.

 

**TLDR:** 

My positions: 20k shares, with an average cost of about 4.75$. I will be selling weekly covered calls at varying strikes, to take advantage of the high IV. I'm happy to be paid to wait."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|['DD', '$NOK']|['NOK']|['$NOK', '$GME', 'I', 'I', '$NOK', 'DD', 'FCF', 'FCF', 'G', '$NOK', 'D', 'US', 'I', 'IV']|['NOK', 'GME', 'NOK', 'NOK']

We're in a war with the hedge funds and with wallstreet and basically the root of corruption in America with our GME short squeeze proxy war, and if you autists want to win this war, you need to know the enemy, and know yourself.Firstly, education is KEY, so if you're new, you DEFINITELY need to go learn at least what a short squeeze is and a short ladder attack is.

What the enemy is doing:

1. ***Price manipulation:*** With short ladder attacks, they use high frequency trading to make the price artificially lower.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4pji/gme\_volume\_still\_low\_with\_positive\_cmf\_which/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4pji/gme_volume_still_low_with_positive_cmf_which/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la5upr/dont\_panic\_and\_just\_look\_at\_the\_fucking\_volume/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la5upr/dont_panic_and_just_look_at_the_fucking_volume/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laak53/for\_those\_of\_you\_getting\_scared\_look\_at\_that\_tiny/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laak53/for_those_of_you_getting_scared_look_at_that_tiny/)This can be seen with sizeable price movements that have tiny amounts of volume. There are several reasons why they are doing this:
   1. Scare off paper hand bitches: They prey on people who jumped on GME without even knowing what a short squeeze is; they see price fall, they paper hands and they get out.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall\_street\_plan\_trying\_to\_psychologically\_scare/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall_street_plan_trying_to_psychologically_scare/)
   2. Make it cheaper for them to cover their more costly short positions.
   3. Price manipulation will fail ultimately because while they are able to drive prices lower with their short attacks, when they eventually have to cover their short positions and buy, they will again drive prices up due to purchases of almost none existing stock (cuz we be holding), sending prices up as high as before they shorted or even higher. All the while hedge funds will continue to eat fees and interest on their short positions, making this cycle not doable indefinitely.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7bhj/gme\_mms\_have\_until\_tomorrow\_22\_to\_buy\_shares\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7bhj/gme_mms_have_until_tomorrow_22_to_buy_shares_it/)
2. ***Media manipulation***
   1. Most if not all American main stream media is clearly serving corporate and wallstreet interests, simply by the false narratives they are reporting.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1022/hmmm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1022/hmmm/)They are not to be trusted and if seen, can dishearten and shake the will of those who don't have diamond hands. Best to avoid if you are a paper handed bitch. Some examples of false narratives are:
      1. Reddit is made up of alt-rights, or idiots, or gamblers, etc. -> We're not idiots, because we're the ones who were able to grab wallstreet by the nutsack. We're retards and autists who love the stock and the company. That is all.
      2. Reddit is moving on to silver. -> SILVER CANNOT BE SQUEEZED!!!!! With a market cap of more than $1.5 Trillion, there is NO WAY for retail investors to be able to make a dent in that. The only possible short squeeze play is GME because it's a small cap company with a market cap of only $250 million as of July 2020, so it is definitely doable for a bunch of retards on WSB to affect the price of a small cap company stock. Literally all the posts on reddit promoting SLVR are from bot accounts that have sus creation dates and karma and post counts. Plus, Citadel owns a giant amount of silver so silver prices going up higher is gonna benefit them and give them more fuel to fight this GME war. You're shooting yourself int eh foot if you buy SLVR. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1xhf/guess\_who\_owns\_tonnes\_of\_slv\_options\_fuck\_citadel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1xhf/guess_who_owns_tonnes_of_slv_options_fuck_citadel/)
      3. ""XXX IS THE NEXT GME"" -> This is also a false narrative. NOTHING can be the next GME, because NOTHING is shorted as much as GME, which is STILL over 100% shorted. GME IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY GAIN FOR US, AND LOSS FOR THEM!
      4. Shorts have covered their position. -> Another false narrative. Short interest is still over at 100%, and there are multiple WSB posts that explain this. Another metric that correlates to short interest is cost of borrowing for opening short positions, which would increase if it is harder to find shares to short.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7d94/no\_more\_shares\_to\_short/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7d94/no_more_shares_to_short/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laaai8/gme\_short\_interest\_is\_currently\_sitting\_at\_12297/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laaai8/gme_short_interest_is_currently_sitting_at_12297/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5d6sk/gme\_short\_interest\_increased\_to\_7141m\_after\_jan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5d6sk/gme_short_interest_increased_to_7141m_after_jan/)
3. ***Breaking the law:*** Some if not all of the things posted above are pretty much border line illegal, but there has been clear signs of breaking the law and market manipulation, IE: freeze buying of select stocks and only allow for selling. They can spin it however they want, but as far as I know, it has been unprecedented for a majority of brokerages to simultaneously alter the way a stock can be traded with cash. And if the situation is desparate enough, they'll break the law again and again if it ends up costing them less than to just let the price get to $69.420. Expect them to fight dirty until the bitter end.
4. ***Social Media Manipulation:*** Hedge Funds now employ bots to spread doubt and misinformation in order to weaken your hands. Some places they target is WSB itself, other stock trading subreddits, facebook, and on sites / apps like Webull and Yahoo Finance. Don't believe in random comments. Always believe in WSB posts with huge amounts of likes (top posts are vetted by the 8 mil users here / by mods too to make sure they're factual)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafh4d/in\_case\_you\_needed\_proof\_that\_there\_are\_imposters/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafh4d/in_case_you_needed_proof_that_there_are_imposters/)
5. ***Their Current Strategy:*** Wallstreet calls us ""dumb money"", because they think we are unsophisticated and just chase after a quick buck, and we have short attention spans. They'll try and continue to manipulate the price so that the stock will trade sideways, or continuous short ladder attacks, trying to scare paper hands into selling, and bore diamond hands into selling as well. They will also try to tempt us with other ""NEXT GME"" type plays and may even artificially raise prices of a stock or two (IE: SILVER) to try and get people to hop off the GME rocket. They'll use media to continue to push narratives that the GME short squeeze is over, short positions are covered, and redditors have moved onto something else. If this fails, then they may simulate a ""SQUEEZE"" by suddenly letting the price go up to $700 or $800, then unleash a short ladder attack unlike which we have ever seen, to simulate the sell off, so idiot retards will be scared into thinking they missed the top, so they will all sell. But if people just look at the volume, they'll know it's all a ruse.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What we're doing, our advantage, and why the enemy can't win.

1. ***This is a movement:*** This has become more than a few people of a subreddit trying to make a quickbuck off of a short squeeze. This has become a movement that represents the struggle between the corruption of wallstreet and the 1% vs the 99%, the common people. News agencies from all over the globe are reporting on this and have their eyes on this. We have ape brothers and sisters all over the world buying and holding this stock together. We even have a few outspoken whales on our side as well, as well as politicians from both sides of the spectrum speaking out for our side as well. We have billboards being bought all over the country, airplanes flying banners about GME. A global movement will crush any hedge fund.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5mt6n/gme\_short\_squeeze\_the\_whales\_have\_arrived/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5mt6n/gme_short_squeeze_the_whales_have_arrived/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qtey/kjetill\_stjerne\_is\_da\_real\_mvp\_he\_his\_friends\_are/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qtey/kjetill_stjerne_is_da_real_mvp_he_his_friends_are/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rf4k/times\_square\_right\_now/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rf4k/times_square_right_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
2. ***We are holding, and we're continuing to buy:*** We are getting smarter, tougher, and slowly but surely paper hands are turning into diamond hands. We managed to hold during the short attack to \~$110 on Thursday, and that was when they froze our ability to buy across many brokerages. They will never have another chance to do this again now with everyone watching. The volume trading these days is getting smaller and smaller. Any price decrease is strictly from short ladder attacks, and not us selling, due to tiny tiny volumes. Also, we are continuing to buy calls on GME to increase upward pressure. No one here has stopped buying. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labvei/volume\_is\_low\_dont\_believe\_the\_news\_no\_one\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labvei/volume_is_low_dont_believe_the_news_no_one_is/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l83ctf/the\_volume\_of\_gme\_has\_plummeted\_the\_past\_few\_days/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l83ctf/the_volume_of_gme_has_plummeted_the_past_few_days/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lagd2m/millions\_in\_gme\_calls\_bought\_today\_at\_800\_hold/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lagd2m/millions_in_gme_calls_bought_today_at_800_hold/)
3. ***Nuclear Bomb still undetonated***\*:\* Short Squeeze still coming, it hasn't happened yet. We know this because the volume of shares bought is not nearly enough to show the shorts have bought enough to be covered.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1q9hy/l2\_nyse\_quotes\_for\_gme\_volume\_the\_squeeze\_hasnt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1q9hy/l2_nyse_quotes_for_gme_volume_the_squeeze_hasnt/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l66kcl/gme\_volume\_is\_low\_shorts\_arent\_covering\_hold/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l66kcl/gme_volume_is_low_shorts_arent_covering_hold/)
4. ***Enemy loses money everyday, we don't:*** It costs the hedge funds billions to continue to fight this war of attrition becauase they continue to eat insanely high fees and interest on their short positions because the cost of borrowing remains high because the short interest are remaining high. Melvin down over 50% just this month alone. You think they can hold on much longer and keep eating fees?[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labq1a/this\_is\_so\_satisfying\_to\_look\_at/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labq1a/this_is_so_satisfying_to_look_at/)Meanwhile we don't have to pay anything for holding our stocks. We can literally just hold and not have a short squeeze and just from the cost of borrowing alone the hedge funds will run out of money, so that's why there will come a time where it's cheaper for them to cover their positions rather than just keep on bleeding until they die out. I don't think they can hold out for another month of trading sideways with no progress. I believe in Feb we will see some major action. It could even start as early as tomorrow, because that's the last day shorts have to cover their 1/29 puts that expired.
5. ***We're not breaking the laws, they are:*** Recent rumor mills are saying that there are a lot of [counterfit stocks](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) circulating and the hedge funds and clearing houses are all in on it, and once they need to start to find shares to buy to cover their short positions, things are going to explode in a way that is unprecedented. Basically by taking advantage of a situation wallstreet has set up (insane short interest set up for short squeeze) we may have uncovered one of the biggest financial crimes in the history of the stock market. You bet that the government and SEC will be involved soon if this is true, and things will explode to the stratosphere. Read the following and ponder yourself, I'm not a financial advisor, just a dumb ape. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the\_real\_reason\_wall\_street\_is\_terrified\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)[https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow\_the\_crumbs\_gme\_exposed\_the\_meta/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
6. ***We're getting smarter:*** Everyday we get new DD on WSB and more and more people are reading these DD's and understand how to diamond hands, and can now filter out fake news from mainstream media. We've just hit 8 mil subs; our subs are going exponential. We've recovered from the RH fiasco and we're primed and loaded on other brokerages like Fidelity. We are more ready than EVER to continue this war and this fight.
7. ***An Ape's Move this week:*** Again, not financial advice, but hypothetically if there was an autistic ape, the autistic ape would buy the dips, ESPECIALLY at this insane discount price of around $100. The autistic ape knows that basically it is paying $100 for a ticket to ride the GME train past $1k, easily 10x their bananas. Those apes who bought in at $300 will only get to 3x their bananas at the end of the month. The autistic apes will also understand that this is not a 1 day thing, but the events leading up to the squeeze can take weeks. But the autistic ape will ask itself, is it willing to wait a few weeks to at least 3x their bananas? Most apes will answer yes. But the ape knows if they buy it, they should be prepared to see red in their banana tracker for a month. But those red number are just fake numbers generated by HFT short ladder attacks, and not due to other apes actually selling their bananas, because apes together STRONK.

We wanted to reach out to you after a transformative week in the markets to answer a question we know many of you are asking: “Why did Robinhood limit certain stocks?”   


We understand that the temporary limits we placed on certain stocks this past week were frustrating for many, especially since we built Robinhood to expand access to investing. We have always sought to put our customers first and we want you to be able to invest on your own terms.   


To help explain what happened and why we had to take action, we wrote [**a letter to our customers**](http://sg.robinhood.com/ls/click?upn=6fntGirSE5selsQKrSSUHh6lgFyOgotlCTJW8UC1di71-2FN8W9HLDeGxWC4U5aEavH91h1h75nfEoi40O-2BJp241os1OXbwqcvqJ1wx8fRtdZa4yPHJd3VaV9ZmuiW1Y8kIkOs_0QWL-2FCUCqlU7jIqxpPSB9OxM9FRLms8ed02eETm0XmLyPxEEZ9Yx1osF-2F2Olc0X95ijU64uSuhF1vPTW00ASBRnRYzE5nDEQo9kVCzyEPt6JRUURrNQwUEmhfgeIfRCW86mSXVtX2-2BS9LhHDNVmjdC8lpjCulKPt7v9hOTXzII645jTe2IqLIFCc-2BmHCi-2BVQ0W0yUI6HviMaE33-2BukVQvcPGCCZWjFtJsTSMS75-2BCmQbOmWbm8feSSdfOQpH08fSwx12NTBbXE46HOsa1cV-2F8j-2FJeCqDt-2BXbwuLJgrJb24pZiEuECgjY5seWaf5QttGF) and captured the key understandings for you below:

**Hostess Brands (TWNK)** has high (\~15%) short interest (more than AMC or BB) setting the stage for a short squeeze, additional upside from a gamma squeeze, is extremely memeable, AND has a fundamentally sound business with strong cash flows and organic growth trading at a reasonable valuation. ***Not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade.***

# Intro

Sup guys. So I know a bunch of us are now looking for the next big opportunity to pile into. Unfortunately we probably won’t see a squeeze of GME’s magnitude for awhile since that kind of short interest is insanely rare, but I think we might have found an opportunity that is pretty low hanging fruit AND is significantly better relative value than the other names people are piling into. It has what the finance community call “asymmetric upside” (more upside potential than downside risk), for the reasons I’ll describe below.

**So what’s the target?** ***Hostess Brands (NASDAQ: TWNK)***. You probably know them as the company that makes Twinkies, but they also make Cupcakes, DingDongs, HoHos, Donettes and Zingers (can’t make this up)…now they’re going to make us some Tendies™ as well.

For some historical context, the company was private-equity owned for awhile and then went public via a SPAC in 2016 (before SPAC's were as cool as they are today). The previous owners have fully sold out now, so the entire shares outstanding are pretty much public float today and there’s no more downward pressure on the stock price from their share sales.

The company also has warrants from the SPAC (effectively long-dated call options) that trade under TWNKW. They trade as half warrants, so need two warrants to form one share and are ITM at $11.50 per one full share and expire in November 2021.

**So what’s the thesis?** We think there’s an opportunity to wring out the short sellers in this name and potentially even further upside from a gamma squeeze if we can get enough call option volume. From a fundamental standpoint, the business is extremely stable (as it was a pretty ideal candidate for an LBO), and trades at a slight discount to its peers.

# Technical Thesis

1. **High short interest = squeeze opportunity** – Roughly 15% short interest today, higher than AMC which is last reported at 10-15% (see end of post for reference) and BB at 5-10%. This seems low in comparison to GME, but again this company has no structural problems that we’re aware of (can’t really say the same for movie theaters or mall-based retailers right now) and has actually been performing pretty well. Also, anything above 20% short interest is considered pretty high in the normal world. This level of short interest on a solid business smells like opportunity to squeeze out a couple of greedy hedge funds.
2. **Limited liquidity and trading volume will make it difficult for shorts to cover** – Average 3-month daily trading volume of 1.4mm shares (roughly 1% of the float). It would take about *13+ DAYS* for the shorts to fully cover if they were to buy up all the average daily trading volume. Current $2bn market cap is also in the perfect sweet spot for the WSB pool of capital (especially since many of us have our tendies tied up in GME right now). If you’re looking for a bit of tendie diversification, this is the name.
3. **The potential for a Gamma squeeze is all further upside** – There’s actually been option activity picking up on this company. ***On Friday, Nasdaq reported that call options for 2.6mm of underlying shares traded hands on TWNK. This is with limited mention of TWNK online thus far (based on my keyword search through reddit)****.* See [this report](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-friday-option-activity%3A-twnk-wdc-nvcr-2021-01-29). Most of those options were sold OTM at the $17.50 strike price. Things are moving quick here and we might not be the only ones that have sniffed out this opportunity. In order to create the biggest upside, buying the highest strike call option is ideal. As the price moves closer to ITM on those options, the market makers will have to buy more shares to hedge. The IV is still really low on this name.

# Fundamental Thesis

1. **Snacking continues to be king.** Large market, resilient, growing. 95% of U.S. adults snack daily, and the average American snacks 3x-5x per day. The snacking category generates \~$150bn in annual sales and is expected to continue growing mid-single-digits driven by the need for convenience as consumers (at least pre-COVID-19) are busier than ever. Lots of room for multiple winners in the industry, of which I think Hostess will continue to be one.
2. **Strong organic growth story**. Organic sales have grown \~6% per year on average over the last number of years. Hostess Brands is growing – and likely gaining share.
3. **Strong brand value and nostalgia factor with millennials.** Some of you might be old enough to remember this but during 2012, when the company filed for bankruptcy (due to the heavy debt burden from its buyout), consumers freaked out that the company would discontinue production of their beloved Twinkies, triggering a mad scramble to buy up all available supply of Twinkies. ***At the peak Twinkies sold on Ebay for $22,000 (see article*** [***here***](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/on-ebay-the-starting-bid-for-a-single-twinkie-is-now-5-000/265346/)***).***
4. **The acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 rides the healthy snack trend.** Voortman sells crème wafers and sugar free cookies (new product categories for Hostess), and markets as having no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup, and no trans-fat (playing the “better-for-you” snack trend). Voortman is one of the fastest growing independent sweet snacking brands of scale in North America, and should be able to accelerate growth by leveraging Hostess’ existing distribution footprint.
5. **COVID-19 re-opening should drive a bounce-back in convenience store traffic, which is the company’s primary sales channel and may also increase demand as consumers become busy again (and thus snack more).** Management plans to keep growing within the convenience store channel, which is a growing end-market and should rebound as the world re-opens. As consumers get back to their busy pre-COVID-19 lives, they may also go back to snacking more out of convenience.

# Potential Risks

1. **Changing consumer preferences, especially to healthy.** The recent acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 allows Hostess to further capitalize on the healthy trend.
2. **Pretty high leverage for a public company.** They have roughly $950mm of net debt, or \~4x leverage on Adj. EBITDA (Adj. EBITDA is a proxy for cash flow). This is pretty high leverage for a public company (but quite low in private equity land). Leverage increased to \~4.5x in the beginning of 2020 after the acquisition of Voortman Cookies (up from \~3.4x before the acquisition), but has steadily declined to \~4x today as Adj. EBITDA has grown. Given their cash flow profile, would not be surprised to see them continue to deleverage.
3. **Customer concentration.** The Company’s largest customer is Walmart, which was \~24% of sales. Top ten customers accounted for \~62% of sales in 2019. Some risk with customer concentration, but Hostess Brands is such a well-known and entrenched brand that I don’t think retail stores will do anything irrational.
4. **Rebound of COVID-19.** Risk that COVID-19 cases rise again, possibly hurting traffic and sales through retail stores, increasing costs, or causing supply chain disruptions. On the flip side, the snack category seems to have held steady from consumers staying at home and snacking more.

# Conclusion

If you’re looking for a little tendie diversification or finding the next oversold stock, look no further. This stacks up as a much better opportunity than AMC or BB given the higher short interest and more stable business fundamentals. Also, we can also potentially create even more upside with a gamma squeeze if we are able to buy more call options at the high strike prices.

***Again, this is not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade (and hopefully does not require much capital). Bringing this to your attention now before it starts to trade away from us or before the hedge funds exit their shorts. More than happy to hear any feedback from you guys.***"|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082633.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['DR', 'AMC', 'AND', 'LDING', 'THE', 'LINE', 'ON', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'AND', 'SPAC', 'SPAC', 'TWNKW', 'ITM', 'AMC', 'BB', 'GME', 'WSB', 'GME', 'TWNK', 'TWNK', 'OTM', 'ITM', 'IV', 'U', 'S', 'I', 'BITDA', 'BITDA', 'BITDA', 'I', 'TWNK', 'TWNK', 'TWNK', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'I', 'AMC', 'BB', 'LDING', 'THE', 'LINE', 'ON', 'GME']|['AMC', 'GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'GME']

FireEye has the best incidence response for cyber attacks in the USA and were contracted heavily during the SolarWinds attack tens to hundreds of companies last quarter. They have seen some rougher quarters while dealing with debt and company reorganizations. They should post above expected earning this quarter which are released tomorrow after hours.

I just turned 27 last week right when this all started and for my birthday I got a knife in the back from Vlad Tenev, Robinhood and the suits. 

I almost didn’t go to school because of money struggles growing up. It took me six years to get my bachelors degree: first community college then transferred to a university. I graduated two years ago and I’ve been struggling to find a stable job and Covid did not help. I went through many interviews this year, but was denied over and over or positions were dissolved mid-way through the hiring process because of company redirection. It has really sucked, and I’m sure many of you have gone through same thing. 

For nearly 2 months I was hovering around $100 in bank account and doing grub-hub to pay for my bills. In October I started working in a distribution center...busting my ass until I get a career role. Fortunately, I am in another interview process for an awesome company and position.

I know it’s irresponsible of me to throw everything I’ve made over the past few months into these companies. But I believe in what is happening and this community. This is bigger than money. What the suits have done is unforgivable. Although I am still up pretty well, it does look bad right now, but we still don’t know what’s gonna happen. I’ve come to terms with the potential loss and all the work I’ve done to get here, but I am HOLDING.

I have been in way worse financial positions and I’ve always made it out. Robinhood chose not to do what was right. I will be okay and you will be okay. 

Do what you must.
Money will come and go. See this through.
Keep those diamond hands.

I am also not a financial advisor.

Context Logic Inc, ticker WISH, is a stable, competitive alternative to Ali-Express, that has (since IPO) seen a steady incline despite market fluctuations. 

With record unemployment: [https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/10/business/unemployment-long-term-pandemic/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/10/business/unemployment-long-term-pandemic/index.html)

And Biden's plan to ""buy American"" paired with a new, stirred sense of patriotism amongst the lower to middle class, there is going to be an overwhelming influx of cheap, low cost, alternative household and every day goods. Now you're thinking, why don't they just go to amazon? Amazon's prices would be preferred had we not been in the midst of a pandemic and economic recession. The alternative to going broke is budgeting effectively, and we do that by slapping on the American brand name over cheap overseas goods. Does it matter where it was made if its from an American company? The vast majority of people wouldn't bother checking or caring.

Improving free cash flow in 2020 compared to 2019? Check. Monthly active user growth rising nicely? Yes. Active buyers up compared to the year-ago period? Yep.

After a significantly underperforming IPO, in my humble opinion, the company is a 6-8 bagger by EOY.

This is simply my perspective as an options trader on the current situation with GME. Many of you will hate my perspective. You will call me a (insert rainbow + bear emoji (I am write these on word so yeah)), you will tell me to fuck off and drag me through the mud. But all I am trying to do here is provide this growing community with some original and well thought out due diligence and research on a very popular invesment that many of you have sunk your life savings into. And sometimes you have to go against the grain to help a community see a different perspective. 

I also want to say that I am extremely proud of this sub. This sub has done something that no other sub has done on reddit or any social media platform for that matter. However, this is a sub that was built on Due Diligence, Degenerate Trading, and Crazy Gains and Loss Porn. And to see this sub shine a light on a clearly broken system is something to be truly proud of. 

However, the time may have come to realize that we were indeed robbed of the MOASS. Which it absolutely tears me up inside to say so. This was going to be by far one of the greater events to occur in the history of assets management and trading. I for one was loaded to the hilt in call options and ready to rumble just like many of you. And like many of you I made multiples of my salary within the first few weeks of January, it is life changing money. 

There is an old saying in the industry and within trading, that you “Ride the trade, until it doesn’t make sense anymore”. And I am afraid to that we could either be fast approaching this or have even passed it at this point. So below you will find my technical analysis on GME and why I feel like it might continue its downward trend. This is of course is subject to change, and just my observations. I hope this helps some with a better understanding of what is going on and how to read the charts (Technical Analysis). 

My Technical Analysis approach: I am an intermediate term momentum trader. This simply means that I am trying to trade for the next 5-15 days. The tools I use are the following:

· RSI: Measures the strength of the movement or the strength of the momentum.

· MACD: This is trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price, and helps you understand the momentum of a stock

· Volume: Speaks for itself

· MVWAP & SMA: Helps Identify intermediate term trend and takes into consideration by comparing to shorter-term trend. (MVWAP: Pink Line, SMA: Teal Line)

I usually use a mix of the 15 & 30 Minute chart paired with the 1 Hour to identify patterns within the market.

Chart (A): Below you will find the 15-minute chart, that spreads over the past five days of trading. Each data point represents a 15-minute segment of trading. The Black shaded areas represent the trading session and the grey shaded area represent pre-market and after-hours trading. 

&#x200B;

[Chart \(A\) 15 minute intervals](https://preview.redd.it/lay0kxbpdye61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0639aa416de5f96a4228d5e8b4cb7fa3b5c3d973)

Tuesday of Chart(A) shows extremely bullish pattern being built late Tuesday afternoon and continued into the afterhours. This was the culmination of Papa Elon, and Camath chipping in their two cents on twitter, along with a clear series of purchases by institutional buyers (This very well could have been Melvin and the early shorts covering their positions). Additionally we can see that the VWAP and SMA are diverging further apart (Bulllish). The MACD is showing the same as well, with the Histogram showing no signs of slowing down as well (Bullish). And despite an onslaught of short attacks and put ladders during trading on Wednesday we still managed to end the day “Green”. However, we can see that the volume drove itself right off a cliff, and we all know what happened there after. 

Ever since the security price has shown an increased amount of volatility and the bid / ask spread continues to widen throughout every trading session. Clearly the market makers are not doing their job in creating a market for the stock and/or there is blatant fuckery going on behind the scenes. Either way it does spell bad news for the underlying security. 

Furthermore, we can see that during the Thursday trading session that three bearish events occur; 1) the MVWAP and SMA begin to diverge, 2)MACD Plummets with a bearish signal line crossover, and 3) The RSI Plummets to sold territory as well. 

To further support my hypothesis, I have included the 1 Hour chart as well

&#x200B;

[Chart \(B\) 1 Hour Trading Intervals](https://preview.redd.it/3gt2em3rdye61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbe04b217967c20a258e4e9ad1606ee6ec3dbed0)

As we can see above the same sort of patterns that developed in the short term are now present in the long term (1 hour Chart). Only this time we can see how the patterns are drawn out over a longer period (1 hour intervals), and thus it may give us a better sense of where we might be heading. At this time, we can see that the MVWAP and SMA have tapered out and are possibly at the beginning stages of divergence. That the RSI has neared “oversold” territory (anything below 30 is considered oversold). And finally, the longer term MACD is showing that the momentum is being carried to the downside.  

As I said earlier, “You ride the trade until it doesn’t make sense anymore”. And based off my research I can no longer say that it makes sense to be positioned for the upside. Which is why on Friday I started to trim most of my positions in GME, it simply made no more sense to me to remain on the bullish side of this security. Today I trimmed the remaining bits and will be walking away from GME at this time. 

I hope I am wrong. I hope this stock can reverse and we can go back to the fucking moon. I would be more than happy to dump a bunch of money to help build another Gamma Ramp. But right now, from my point of view that is not where we are.

Again, these are just my observations and I know a lot of you will find this offensive. But if you are going to trade or invest, you have to remove your emotions from the picture. Be a fucking robot. 

For those that are going to ask the trading platform I use is Think or Swim.

Slv etf is not like other stocks. They can create and retire shares at will.

The way it works is authorized investors are able to buy baskets of 50k shares in exchange for the equivalent delivery of silver bullion. 

This delivery to the slv trust creates shares. 

These authorized participants can also buy 50k shares and retire them in exchange for silver bullion withdrawal.

If the etf becomes over valued, an authorized participant can buy silver on the open market (or go to their vault where they have the physical silver purchased already at a lower price) and deliver it to slv trust to receive 50k shares which they can then sell at the over valued market price risk free Arbitrage. 

It seems like some hedge fund is trying to unload silver in mass and is using the hype around wsb as a Catalyst for a price run-up.

1. On Wednesday, Hedge fund saw that they might go belly up and lose the billions. The only solution they saw was to restrict retail traders, who trade on Robinhood overwhelmingly. They asked in whispers IF Robinhood should put restrictions on these stocks. The reason can be formulated by the team of lawyers later. They knew very well this will upset the retail traders and might create an exodus of retail customers from Robinhood.
2. Hedge funds have few hundreds of millions in investment in Robinhood. HF realized it's okay to lose millions and save billions. HF might lose everything if the stocks ($GME etc.) continue to the ride to the moon. Hence the blockade.

This is a classic example of when Robinhood could stand up for us to the bullies and say

They’re bleeding, and all the retail investors holding are slowly sucking the blood out of their fat ugly bodies.

It might take just a few days, or weeks...
But eventually, when they cover, WE retail investors get to set the price.
That’s why you keep seeing 10k (or 69420$) is not a meme. Because it’s not.

We also know they’re down BAD. Why?
Because they’re attacking us any way they can and wasting millions doing so.

So let’s see what tactics they are using:

**Short ladder attacks**:

What is a short ladder attack? 
The big hedgefunds are putting in lower and lower bid prices between themselves. There is little to no volume on those trades, and since no one can buy, it ""looks"" like the stock is plummeting. It’s only effective if we would sell.

**Infiltrating WSB and other social media**:

Here are some random screenshots I took of WSB Synth. Notice the people saying to jump ship and to take GME gains and invest into FORD. Obvious shills. There’s tons of them. Always new, or old accounts that suddenly post again. All those people came in just in time when the short ladder attacks started, just to make it look like people are panic selling and convince us to sell:

**Manipulating the Media**: 

Here are some News channels caught lying / manipulating the market: (SEC if you read this...)

Now let’s get some clarification on **SILVER:**

There is so much misinformation swirling around concerning Silver. People don’t seem to realize 3 things:

1. **Silver is not a get rich quick move. Silver is a LONG TERM HOLD move.** GME is a risky short term play. So YOU decide what makes more sense to get in right now. (Personally I sold all my stocks to buy GME today. YOLO) 
2. The actual Silver sub on reddit does not advocate buying SLV, nor do most of them believe SLV is the move to make. 
3. The hedge funds would love for you to go all-in on Silver and ignore the GME opportunity. Every dollar spent on SLV instead of GME is a double win for them, since SLV is inverting GME and they own a ton of Silver and that’s why they’re pushing this narrative in the media. 

SLV inverting GME: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4mog/stop_buying_slv_you_smooth_brained_retards_its/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

The amount of paper contracts or IShares SLV available is basically infinite. Physical silver is a rare physical commodity with a finite supply, and a very low supply of retail sized bars/rounds/coins.

**IF** you want to go into silver for whatever reason, buy physical. But that’s just my retard opinion. 

**SILVER ISN’T “REDDITS NEXT BIG PLAY“.** You guys need to realize the GME situation is very unique and WSB is not, and never was about starting crazy short squeezes. GME is a rare opportunity where the big guys actually fucked up BIG TIME.

Well. Let’s see to what extend they fucked up exactly: 

**Short Version:**
The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails–to–deliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options – both ITM and OTM).  

Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

Long version here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9rk78/sec_doj_60_minutes_public_data_suggests_massive/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

**At these levels it’s NOT about the price, it’s about the number of shares in the hedgefunds possession. That’s why they want you to sell so bad.**

🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎

Last but not least I’m holding because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I’m holding because I hope to see a better future and I’m holding for all you out there. 
To the Moon or zero.

**On the technical side, $TLRY has been improving all its bottom q/q even. See image below.**

With growth in revenue and net income, EPS have also increased q/q which is a great sign for investors. With US legalization on the horizon and expansion into EU markets, it hard to believe that $TLRY isn't headed up from here. Which should lead to a squeeze on the 50% short when they are forced to cover.

**TLDR; $TLRY has improving technical, balance sheets and is expanding into newer markets. With legalization in US on the horizon, its hard to believe that the 50% shorts wont be squeezed.**

In the first half of December, fuboTV’s stock more than doubled over two weeks on the back of super-strong subscriber numbers. The strength in fuboTV’s subscriber base broadly foreshadows its huge role in the live TV streaming world.

On the heels of that huge rally, multiple short-sellers targeted FUBO. The favored argument amongst bears is that demand for live TV is dying, the streaming platform itself is commoditized and the business model is built on broken economics. Fubo’s short interest currently sits at about 65% of the float.

Then, the Reddit-inspired short-squeeze broke out. It wasn’t just GME stock that went flying. All heavily shorted stocks flew alongside GME stock. FUBO stock, with 65% of its float sold short, was a beneficiary of the rising tide in heavily shorted names.

But, this week, many of these short squeeze stocks have plunged.

Not FUBO stock — and that’s because fuboTV is no GameStop or AMC.

## Unlike GameStop, fuboTV Is Fundamentally Strong

FuboTV — unlike many of the other heavily shorted companies that soared last week — is supported by very strong fundamentals and has a long runway for profitable growth ahead.

Here’s the story.

Media consumption is pivoting from linear TV to streaming TV because the latter is cheaper, more flexible, and more convenient. Yet, even though **Netflix** has reached ubiquity among U.S. households, most households still pay for cable TV, because Netflix doesn’t have live sports, live programming or news — three things which Americans still love to watch.

That’s why a new generation of live TV streaming services has emerged over the past decade. These services take live TV content, and package it into a streaming service — somewhat like a “Netflix for TV”. Because demand for live TV is robust and because streaming TV offers significant advantages over linear TV, these live TV streaming services represent the future of TV and will one day be as commonplace in households as cable TV is today.

fuboTV is one of these live TV streaming services. It’s differentiation is that it is a sports-focused live TV streaming platform. That is, the company is hyper-focused on acquiring exclusive sports content and launching a digital sportsbook to enable dynamic sports betting through its live TV streaming platform.

In other words, fuboTV projects as a live TV streaming service purpose-built for sports super-fans and gamblers.

That’s a large audience. About 70% of Americans classify themselves as sports fans. Around 60% have gambled in the past year. That number is only growing with online sports betting becoming legal in more and more states.

Thus, fuboTV projects as a streaming platform that will one day have tens of millions of paid subscribers. It has just 500,000 paid subs today.

The runway for growth here is very long — and consequently, the potential upside in FUBO stock is very big.

## FuboTV Stock to $200?

My numbers indicate that FUBO stock will soar to $200 over the next several years.

Here are those numbers.

I broadly assume that fuboTV can scale to \~10 million paid subscribers by 2030. I think that average revenue per subscriber per month can grow to about $70, assisted by ad revenue growth and sports betting revenue growth. That implies around $8.4 billion in 2030 revenues for fuboTV.

I see EBITDA margins running towards 20%, as ad revenue and sports betting revenue add higher-margin revenue firepower into the business model and boost margins.

Assuming so, my modeling suggests fuboTV is on track to do about $10 in earnings per share by 2030.

Based on a 20X multiple, that implies a long-term price target for FUBO stock of $200.

## Bottom Line on FUBO Stock

Not all short squeeze stocks are created equal. On one hand, you have GME stock and AMC stock, who have tons of short squeeze firepower but very weak fundamentals. On the other hand, you have FUBO stock, who has almost as much short-squeeze firepower and strong fundamentals, too.

That’s a powerful combination which should sustain the current uptrend in FUBO stock not just for the next few days — but for the next few years, as well."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082633.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['TV', 'TV', 'FUBO', 'TV', 'GME', 'GME', 'FUBO', 'FUBO', 'TV', 'AMC', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'U', 'S', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'FUBO', 'TV', 'FUBO', 'I', 'TV', 'I', 'TV', 'I', 'BITDA', 'TV', 'X', 'FUBO', 'FUBO', 'GME', 'AMC', 'FUBO', 'FUBO']|['GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'AMC']

After reading this post by u/johnnydaggers
https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/ , I got curious if this theory had legs.

I downloaded all the data for the last 10 years, and charted the daily FTD's vs Price action.  It yields some interesting results:

EDIT: Blue lines are # total collective failures on that date, green line is closing price 

GME: https://i.imgur.com/dvqlgib.png 

AMC: https://i.imgur.com/OLymQ4j.png

For both these stocks the failure to delivers are off the charts in recent history, and those increases in failures seem to correlate with suppressed pricing.  Now there may be legit reasons for a failure to happen, and without knowing which firms caused these failures we can't truly draw any conclusions other than *something is fucky*.


We can pretty easily generate a corresponding chart for any symbol with this:

GM: https://i.imgur.com/7d96w7B.png

Now IF these failures are coming from a handful of firms (SEC / DTCC should have that data..), I would say it is quite evident of intentional naked selling to manipulate the markets.  But ~~I'm not an expert~~ _I am a smoothbrained retard ape_ and would love to hear from anyone who understands this better than I do.

This is about how this squeeze is going to affect history.

All of this short squeeze business is nothing more than a numbers game. We’ve been hearing price targets from $1k to $100k, with $100k being considered outlandishly high.

Yes, it’s a lot of money, but this situation boils down to nothing more than a math problem. Math does not care if its a lot of money.

So lets look at some numbers. The most similar event we have ever seen in history is the VW squeeze. This was caused by hedge funds owing a short interest of **12%** and Porsche buying up **43%** of the float. VW became the most valuable company in the world, which in GME’s case would put it at $30,000 per share.

As we all know, GME was shorted 140%. And Im willing to bet that us 💎🤲🦍 are currently holding well over 43% of the float, with no intention of letting go.

I dont need a phd to tell you what that means for GME.

So lets say GME hits $100k, which if you look at the numbers, is a massively conservative estimate.

The hedge funds are dying at $300. At $100k they are going to have to liquidate every asset in their possession to cover their shorts. All their stocks other than GME will be sold. This means the rest of the market is going to plummet. I estimate that march 2020 will look like a joke. The hedge funds will have no way to cover, and someone is going to have to bail them out. **Our economy is about to collapse.**

The hedge funds know this. Why do you think they are so long on Silver and Gold? Precious metals perform well during recessions. 

Andddd because this is WSB, here are my positions:
- GME shares
- SPY 374p 2/5
- SPY 300p 3/1
- SPY 250p 3/1
- UVXY 14c 3/1
- not a single SLV call or share because fuck the hedge funds

TLDR: 🦍🦍🦍💎🤲🌈🐻

A great many of you who are participating in this sub are new to the community and many of you are new to trading/ finance altogether. I have been a long time lurker and have never worked up the courage to post anything of my own. After missing out on the SPY PUT option bonanza that occurred back in March/ April, I vowed I would be put myself in a position to capitalize on the next big thing. Fast forward to GME and while I was a little late to the party, I did get in with everything I could, and regardless of the outcome I have enjoyed myself and have learned more in the last two weeks than during any previous stretch.

Many of the comments on the daily threads center around the price of GME falling and wondering if now is the time to get out. It is common knowledge that we have been the victim of Short Ladder attacks, internal disinformation campaigns, external disinformation campaigns, market manipulation, and straight up suppression. Of specific interest to the neophytes in this community is why the low trading volume last week and especially today matter when the price starts to drop consistently and dramatically, especially during After-Hours trading. 

I pulled some Level II data from Robinhood detailing the AH trading volume and the corresponding price decrease. Between the hours of 4 PM EST and 5:55 PM EST, Robinhood shows a total of 475,690 shares traded. When compared to average volume and the corresponding price drop we arrive at the following:

**Shares Traded: 475,690**

**Average Volume: 106,230,000**

**Volume Percentage: 0.448%**

The closing price at 4 PM was $222.87 and the closing price at 5:55 PM was $176.77 meaning a share price decline of $46.10

During AH trading, GME share price fell **20.7%** on trading volume **0.448%** of the current average. THIS IS A MASSIVE ASYMMETRY and in my mind, it supports the idea that the establishment is suppressing this stock to continue scaring us all out of the market.

I rewatched ""The Big Short"" this afternoon and it was funny to me that in that situation, no one and I mean NO ONE thought any of those guys were right. And when it turned out they were in fact correct, the banks LIED and CONCEALED the true value of the shorts UNTIL they were able to put themselves in a position to try and make money off of the problem they themselves created. Friends, it feels like we are in the same kind of endgame now and I ask that everyone remain diamond-handed and patient. The math is on our side and if it doesn't work out it's because they found a way to cheat and screw us before we knew what they were doing."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['A', 'I', 'SPY', 'PUT', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'II', 'AH', 'PM', 'EST', 'PM', 'EST', 'PM', 'PM', 'AH', 'GME', 'THIS', 'IS', 'A', 'SSIVE', 'METRY', 'I', 'I', 'NO', 'ONE', 'LIED', 'EALED', 'UNTIL', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Notice anything weird about their charts? The HFs are purchasing ETFs that have exposure to GME and are ""redeeming"" the shares inside of them to get access to the rights to a GME stock. They're using the redemption rights from the ETFs to then sell the stock without directly influencing the price of GME. 

Here's some proof from the top four ETFs with exposure to GME:

[2-XSVM](https://imgur.com/fVWAGYI)

[3-RWJ](https://i.imgur.com/59NXkv2.png)

[4-XRT](https://i.imgur.com/59NXkv2.png)

This is likely the reason we're not seeing the other side of their short ladder attacks. They're buying exposure from the ETFs and dumping the redemption rights to flood the market. 

This is not investment advice. I'm long $GME.

To stick it to Wall Street? To earn big? Maybe its a bit of both.

Youve invested, you might be in the red right now, you might want to minimize your losses, you might wonder whats going to happen if it sinks even lower. But you shouldnt ponder if's, you should be thinking about what is actually going to happen. And that my friend, is a big fucking rocket fucking itself through the moon and blowing up mars unleashing a rain of that sweet sweet Wall Street billionaire dollar dollar bill, and those bills now belong to you. 

They say its always darkest just before the sun rises. Fuck the sun. Where we are going we wont see no fucking sun, Were going so far away from this fucking planet that the only thing hotter than you is Gliese 581.

**""But the price is dropping!!! HOW WILL I BE ABLE TO EARN MONEY WHEN IT GOES NEGATIVE??????""**

Stocks are priced after **supply** and **demand.** 

If **supply** is **high** then price is **low**
If **demand** is **high** then price is **high**

But what if the **demand** was **high**, the supply was **low** and you, as someone whos **shorted** this stock, needed the **supply** to be **high** so price becomes **low**

Well...
What you could do is trick the system, it is illegal but you stand to lose a couple million in a lawsuit vs billions in your bad shorting of stocks.

So you hatch a plan. You and your hedgefund friends are going to use your own stocks that you own and trade them very very quickly with eachother at low low prices. The supply is still low, you guys are only trading a couple hundred or thousand stocks, but the system cant recognize that its the **same** stocks being traded. Its just seeing the **amount of times** the same stock is being traded. So one stock being moved 5 times the system sees as 5 different stocks, and therefore thinks the supply is **high**.

Thing is, this only drives the price down. It doesnt matter though, since you as someone who is **holding** isnt selling at that price. It doesnt MATTER what the price is if noone is selling. See, the price decrease because the same stocks are being traded constantly tricking the system into thinking its many different stocks being traded once, however since the price is too low for the people who are holding the other stocks they are not selling. The supply is still **low**.

Why is this important? Its important because the hedgefunds need to **BUY** your stocks to close their positions. They literally cannot close their shorts unless they buy **YOUR** stocks. This is why you are supposed to hold your stocks, no matter how low the price is. The price is a facade, they want you to sell at a price they are setting. If you are not selling even though the price is low, they cant buy. And if they cant buy they cant close their shorts. If they cant close their shorts they'll have to pay interest. And when the interest becomes too much they are going to be **FORCED** to buy **YOUR** stocks at whatever price **YOU** offer. This is the **squeeze**

The squeeze starts when the hedgefunds cant afford to trick the system anymore since the interest on their shorts are getting too much. Theyll have to pay whatever we ask of them. If noone sells untill 1000usd they are going to be forced to pay that, if noone sells until 10000usd theyll have to pay that amount instead. When they are forced to close their positions en masse they will **FLOOD** the marketplace with orders to buy. This is going to skyrocket the stocks, and the price will keep rising until people start selling. However if you sell during the short ladder attacks, the squeeze wont happen. The price set during the attacks isnt the actual price. Its a price thats tricked into the system. 

This is why you **HOLD** no matter how much the price goes down. if **everyone** holds there is no **supply** and if there is no **supply** it doesnt matter how low the price is **SINCE THERE IS LITERALLY NOONE FOR THE HEDGEFUNDS TO BUY FROM** so they cant close their positions, theyll have to keep paying interest, and at some point they will **HAVE** to **BUY YOUR STOCKS** no matter the **PRICE**.

https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml

Buy orders **(demand)** are more than sell orders **(supply)** and yet the stock lost value. 

This is why people are talking about **volume**. The **total amount** of stocks **(actual supply)** being traded is **low (price should increase)**, but **the total amount of times (percieved supply)** those same stocks are being traded is **high (price decreases)**.

You need to understand, it doesnt matter how low the price drops right now, the squeeze hasnt happened. the squeeze happens when the hedgefunds are **forced** to buy back. That is the squeeze, and it is what will skyrocket the stocks. Right now the hedgefunds are trying to prevent the squeeze.

So what are you going to do, give up? or capitalize on their fuck up? Every dollar the hedgefunds lose goes to us, but only so long as we own stocks. 

So **HOLD**, the price might drop but the rocket launches when the HF's are forced to buy back.

I know this will read bullish and I am long $GME still so there’s that. However, please be mindful of seeking evidence for a conclusion &amp; making conclusions based on evidence. In other words, we should try to make decisions based on data, not trying to find anything that supports our decision at all cost. This post was intended to provide information &amp; data with a little analysis. Please attack it, poke holes in it, crucify it, share it on skeptical subs, and otherwise test it before making a conclusion. This is the way, and how we got as far as we did.

Today's most traded retail assets on Fidelity were $AMC &amp; $GME.

And you know what people did? They bought a metric fuckton of shares. Contrary to what some of the Reddit Daily thread sentiment (which may or may not be bot-infested hell at this point) &amp; news outlets claim, retail has seemingly not lost any interest in the stock and possibly prevented it from diving further.

Obligatory disclaimer: Mods, for the love of god please let this through it took a lot to write and I know for a fact it hasn't been discussed sufficiently / didn't get a dedicated post yet. Also, I'm a 🦍 and am not financial advisor and this isn't financial advice. This is a synthesis of public available information with autistic analysis like sprinkles on a birthday cupcake.

Disclaimer 2: I am extremely long $GME 🚀🌙 

With that out of the way, I present to you,

# Exhibit A: Order Distribution

\~***75%*** of all $GME orders on Fidelity *today, on 2/1* were to *buy* the asset, rather than sell it. Each order can have however many shares.

[https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)

That's just Fidelity. If you're able to check the order distribution on other brokers (like Vanguard or Schwab) please post it below and I'll update this post with your info. Usually this information is displayed on Top Traded Stocks or on the stock page itself under some tab. 

There's more:

WeBull is showing a 45/55 distribution on the entire order book. Total Outflow (sells) was quoted at 1099, and total inflow at 996. While this may seem useless at first, consider this: the share price lost ***30***% today, but the order book is split ***45/55***, not ***35/65***. Just 10% of the outflow accounted for the 30% collapse in share price.

# Exhibit B: Volume

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/)

Today's volume was half of the daily average. *Half of the daily average*. And while the price 30% movement may seem scary at first, trending down on low volume is actually a bullish sign. Courtesy of u/weedcomet:

""[https://finance.zacks.com/importance-price-changes-previous-day-stock-market-2906.html](https://finance.zacks.com/importance-price-changes-previous-day-stock-market-2906.html) 'After a strong-volume upward move, if the market moves sideways in conjunction with lower volume for several days in a row, it is a bullish sign indicating that all overhanging selling pressure has been relieved and any buying could spark a strong price rise.'""

In other words, flat or even *declining* on low volume often precedes 🚀 🚀 🌝. Literally any form of significant buying can move the price by a very high magnitude.

There's also been studies done on this phenomena, and correlation was established between sideways or negative movement on low volume and a subsequent increase in price. Feel free to research this on your own accord and post your findings below for all of us autists to read.

# Exhibit C: Why Retail Buying May Return Soon

I'm not a financial advisor, and even less so Nostradamus. I don't know when we'll be able to take advantage of this sideways movement to our benefit. What I do know is that that time is approaching. Considering two major events:

1. Transition from Robinhood &amp; other affected brokers to mainstream solutions  
• This was likely started en masse on Thursday, before RH transfer restrictions kicked in. It takes 2-5 market days to transfer an account to another broker, and about the same for just slushing cash around. That means, a solid chunk of trades will be able to buy into the market beginning tomorrow and throughout the remaining week.  
• Many are also in the process of opening up new accounts. These were probably started en masse on Friday, when transfer restrictions prevented people from taking the plunge. A solid chunk of brokers need settlement time for instant deposits.  
\- The instant deposits are capped, meaning whale accounts aren't able to kick in yet. Regular deposits takes 1-2 business days to clear. Beginning tomorrow, we'll start seeing larger retail accounts com online and regain their impact on price delta.
2. Robinhood bottleneck may or may not disappear this week. Robinhood just raised another $2.4 billion on top of their previous round, which is more than enough to clear DTC's collateral requirements. According to their own statements as of late, this was the primary reason why Robinhood restricted asset purchases in the first place. If you're willing to trust them on that, it means that we shall see a resurgence in volume from remaining Robinhood users in the coming days.

# Conclusions

Putting 1+2+3 together we get a potential recipe for another green EoW. Retail sentiment being positive can translate into higher volume once logistical bottlenecks are cleared and resume ass-ripping activities. HOWEVER, it is by NO MEANS guaranteed, and only the tippy top of the world know exactly what these mfs might pull off in the coming days. Get yourselves ready for either a positive or negative scenario this week / beginning of next.

GME to moon.

**ANOTHER EDIT:**
Welcome to the end of the post. I’m proud of you for making it this far in literacy class. I want to respond to all of your comments and questions but automod deletes all but a couple of them. I’ll answer them as soon as they show up.

**UPDATE:**
Ok automod deleted a bunch of negative feedback which is WRONG. Also some FAQs that got blocked. The questions were valid so here’s the best I could do:

1–Retail made no dent so what to expect now?
- I don’t know what to expect. What I do know is that retail made no dent because of the bottlenecks mentioned in Exhibit C above.

2–Should I buy now or what?
- I want you to make your own conclusion based on available evidence, not seek confirmation bias. I don’t want to be liable for your money and neither does anyone else.

3–Smart money is leaving and you’ll be left holding the bag
- I have yet to see credible evidence in either the trading volume, SEC reports, or formal announcements from any major institutional shareholder of GameStop that indicates they’re leaving. If you have this information please relay it to me (don’t use comments, you’ll get blocked by bot). BlackRock had to adjust due to internal requirements AFAIK correct me if I’m wrong

4–AMC?
- I have no data on AMC. You should do your own research and make a thread like this.

5–When selling then?
- I have an emergency exit plan like everyone else should. I don’t have the financial capability to let GME go to 0. I’ll keep a small position post-exit just in case. Make an exit plan that aligns with what loss or gain you can stomach. Don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose. Nothing on this sub is financial advice. You don’t have to sell if you can lose everything. I’m probably liquidating my options and doing shares only until further trend confirmation."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|['$GME', 'DONT', 'BUY', 'INTO', 'THE', 'FUD']|['GME']|['RTANT', 'I', 'I', '$GME', '$AMC', '$GME', 'I', 'I', '$GME', 'I', '$GME', 'I', 'I', 'RH', 'A', 'W', 'WEVER', 'NO', 'MEANS', 'GME', 'OTHER', 'I', 'WRONG', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'C', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'SEC', 'AFAIK', 'AMC', 'I', 'AMC', 'I', 'I', 'GME']|['GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'RH', 'GME', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'GME']

As we know, the short squeeze (SS) is not a matter of IF. It's a matter of WHEN. The HFs know this, WSB users that know half a thing about the stock market know this. Now, the goal of the HF isn't to cancel the SS, it's to make it as less expensive as possible for them. In other words,  [here is what their bloomberg terminal screen is showing](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/026/981/0bd0ed742059cd7f4c83882095aeb3752e45dfbfv2_hq.jpg)

Now comes my theory: paper hands, aka people acting on emotion because of FUD and panic rather than what the numbers say (volume, technical analysic, etc.) are benefitting both us and HF. By selling at a loss or a meager price (anything less than 1k$ is free money, remember), they're allowing HF to cover their shorts for cheaper. 

Let's say the HF have a price target on GME of 1000$. In other words, their Harvard quants calculated that at a certain point, they could cover all their shorts and make the SS happen until GME hits 1000 (what I call the D-Day). After that point, they will no longer need to buy anymore shares, ending their torture. They would have covered most of their shorts without going bankrupt. That means that their goal will be to tire us, spread FUD, throw ladder attacks until they can quickly cover their shorts from whatever the price will be to 1000$ (supposing 1000$ is the price they calculated is the more beneficial)

The HF goal is to not go bankrupt. Therefore, paper hands selling their shares could make the SS happen faster by giving more shares to HF (while giving us more shares for cheap, naturally) until the D-Day. 

It's a **win-win scenario for diamond hands**. Whether paper hands sell or not, **the SS WILL happen**. 

disclaimer: I know nothing about the stock market, I'm just theorizing. What do everyone thinks of this?

TLDR: Paper hands selling might make the SS happen faster for holders (as long as there isn't too many of them)."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082633.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['GME', 'IF', 'WHEN', 'WSB', 'HF', 'SS', 'FUD', 'HF', 'HF', 'HF', 'GME', 'SS', 'GME', 'I', 'FUD', 'HF', 'SS', 'HF', 'SS', 'WILL', 'I', 'SS']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME']

> Short selling involves a sale of a security that the seller does not own or a sale which is consummated by the delivery of a security borrowed by, or for the account of, the seller. Short sales normally are settled by the delivery of a security borrowed by or on behalf of the seller.

> In a ‘‘naked’’ short sale, however, the short seller does not borrow securities in time to make delivery to the buyer within the standard three-day settlement period. As a result, the seller fails to deliver securities to the buyer when delivery is due.

> **Sellers sometimes intentionally fail to deliver securities as part of a scheme to manipulate the price of a security, or possibly to avoid borrowing costs associated with short sales, especially when the costs of borrowing stock are high.**

**This is what happened today with the price decrease**

To nobody's surprise, Gamestop short sellers Fail-To-Deliver a whopping... 

~~5 MILLION~~

*edit: Apparently the Fail-To-Deliver is not cumulative, but as of 1-14 it's 621,483 and that number can only be higher now. Regardless, the sentiment stands.*

shares of the stock meaning these short sellers are using Naked Short Selling and intentionally failing to deliver securities in order to avoid borrowing costs and manipulate the price of the stock downward.

# What's to be done?

Rule 204.

> Rule 204 — Close-out Requirements. Under Rule 204, participants of a registered clearing agency (as defined in section 3(a)(24) of the Exchange Act) must deliver securities to a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement on a long or short sale transaction in any equity security by settlement date, or must close out a fail to deliver in any equity security for a long or short sale transaction in that equity security generally by the times described as follows: the participant must close out a fail to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+4; if a participant has a fail to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona-fide market making activities, the participant must close out the fail to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in “threshold securities” if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days. Threshold securities, as defined by Rule 203(c)(6), are generally equity securities with large and persistent fails to deliver.

You can read more about this here: https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.204 lots of information that I haven't covered.

Gamestop *is* or will be classified as a threshold security due to the massive amounts of Fail-To-Deliver's they've accumulated this month, this means short sellers are legally forced to close their short positions and clearing houses will be be required to immediately purchase shares within the time-frame stated above. AKA SQUEEZE WILL BE SQUOZEN.

Edit: According to [this](https://www.theocc.com/Market-Data/Market-Data-Reports/Series-and-Trading-Data/Threshold-Securities-List) website, Gamestop IS listed as a threshold security.

#SHORT SELLERS ARE UNDER THE THUMB, AND ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY'RE SQUEEZED.

Their last hail mary is to manipulate the price downward as much as possible to lessen the blow of the inevitable squeeze. We literally have them by the balls and all we have to do is HOLD.

#TL:DR

The short squeeze is a ticking time bomb right now and all we have to do is hold to win. In a matter of days, short sellers will be FORCED to close their positions and clearing houses will be forced to purchase shares for all Fail-to-Delivers forcing the price to skyrocket and the squeeze to be squozen.

HOLD TIGHT YOU RETARDS, WE'RE GOING TO THE MOON. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/low\_volume\_pullback.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/low_volume_pullback.asp)

""Low volume pullbacks are often a sign of weak longs taking profit, **but suggest that the long-term uptrend remains intact.""**

This Zacks link goes into good detail on interpreting low volume and stock price manipulation:

[https://finance.zacks.com/mean-stock-price-goes-up-down-little-volume-2497.html](https://finance.zacks.com/mean-stock-price-goes-up-down-little-volume-2497.html)

"" Interpreting Price and Volume Action

Price action reflects investor sentiment. If a stock is rising, investors are eager to buy; if it is falling, investors are eager to sell. **But for a move to be valid, the stock price action must be confirmed by volume**. As technicians say, volume goes with the trend. **Volume shows how much conviction investors have in a trend.**

When you multiply the number of shares traded by the current stock price, you get the total dollar amount that investors are willing to put at risk. **Low volume means few investors are putting only a little money at risk. You cannot trust such price moves, as they are fickle and can easily reverse.""**

 

## Understanding Manipulation

**It is easier to manipulate a stock when its volume is low**. **All a manipulator needs to do is execute a few carefully timed trades to create the illusion that a stock is moving so he can get others to buy or sell**. **The goal is** to raise the price if he wants to sell and t**o lower the price if he wants to buy**. If you are suckered in by such a move, your position can quickly turn into a loss as the stock you just bought suddenly reverses course on increased volume.

They specialize in mining Iron Ore, Nickel, Manganese, Coal, and Copper. It has huge upside with the potential to 10x at a moment's notice.

20% of Analysts rank it as a Strong Buy

80% of Analysts rank it as a Buy

However, the price targets are not the high, why? They have been fined 2 billion dollars by the Brazilian government over a collapsed dam, but that doesn't really matter in the short term does it.

$VALE produces Nickel and Copper which are fundamental to battery production, and it just so happens there is a worldwide shortage on Nickel which is fundamental to battery production. The EV market continues to expand, and with continued growth more and more nickel is needed to meet demand.

So why the huge upside potential?

One Answer: Papa Elon

Elon Musk has said a number of times that Tesla will give sustainable mining companies a large agreement. I believe that the time for a large Tesla contract is soon, and VALE in my opinion is most likely to receive the contract. If this were to happen I would not doubt a price jump of 10x immediately to fall and stay steady at 5x at around $80-$100 a share similar evaluation to $CAT in the short term, and if battery production continues at exponential growth I could this becoming a trillion dollar company by 2030.

It has been growing steadily thus far and I know it will grow a lot more into 2021 with Biden putting up a lot of money into green energy. 

Here's a list of things Biden is doing for green energy, which will ultimately push ICLN upwards :

1. Joining the Paris Climate Agreement
2. Cancelling the Keystone Oil Pipeline
3.  Biden will invest $400 billion over ten years, as one part of a broad mobilization of public investment, in clean energy and innovation. That investment is twice the investment of the Apollo program which put a man on the moon, in today’s dollars. He will also establish ARPA-C, a new research agency focused on accelerating climate technologies.  
4. Biden will set a target of reducing the carbon footprint of the U.S. building stock 50% by 2035, creating incentives for deep retrofits that combine appliance electrification, efficiency, and on-site clean power generation. He will work with our nation’s governors and mayors to support the deployment of more than 500,000 new public charging outlets by the end of 2030. And, Biden will ensure our agricultural sector is the first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions, and that our farmers earn income as we meet this milestone. 
5.  Biden will require public companies to disclose climate-related financial risks and the greenhouse gas emissions in their operations and supply chains. In his first year, he’ll work to enact legislation requiring polluters to bear the full cost of their climate pollution. But that’s not all: Biden will direct his EPA and Justice Department to pursue these cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and, when needed, seek additional legislation to hold corporate executives personally accountable – including jail time when merited. Allowing corporations to continue to pollute – affecting the health and safety of both their workers and surrounding communities – without consequences perpetuates an egregious abuse of power. These companies must be accountable to the American people, the communities where they operate, and the workers they employ. 
6.  Every federal dollar spent on rebuilding our infrastructure during the Biden Administration will be used to prevent, reduce, and withstand the impacts of this climate crisis. American workers should build American infrastructure and manufacture all the materials that go into it, and all of these workers must have the option to join a union and collectively bargain. Biden will ensure his [infrastructure legislation](https://joebiden.com/infrastructure) incorporates labor provisions so federal investments create millions of middle-class jobs, benefiting workers across industries.  

All of this is straight from his website. Since ICLN is an etf and does not swing ( A good thing IMO ) it is an extremely good candidate for buying shares.

But since we like to live on the edge, the best thing for us to do would be to buy ATM or ITM options that expire a long time from now.

To me it’s unclear how the recent SolarWinds hack will impact Q4 earnings due to the timing of the hack. On a recent conf call Mandia mentioned that Incident Response hours aren’t billed until after the incident response engagement is over. The SolarWinds news broke on Sunday Dec 13th.  Response engagements of this scale typically take weeks if not months. So we might be looking at meeting Q4 estimates but raising Q1 guidance.  Even without a beat, I’ll take this as a bullish sign. 

I’ve been watching job openings at FireEye for the last month.  They’ve been recruiting non-stop and a large portion of these at Incident Response or other services consultants. There are currently 192 open roles.  

Back of the napkin calculations are... many of the senior roles will be sent immediately into the field at a billing rate between $250-$450. At a 80% utilization that is between $400k-$720k per head per year. If they have hired between 50-100 people into these roles since the Solarwinds hack that is could lead to $20M-$36M revenue increase on the low end to $40M-$72M on the high end. With current annual revenues at $928M we could see an annual revenue increase of 7% on these services alone which is above their current 6.9% revenue growth rate. If we see acceleration in any of their newish businesses like Managed Defense and Mandiant Advantage Cyber Threat Intelligence services we could have a great growth story on our hands. Incident Response services are (hopefully) a one time thing for breached companies but Managed Defense and Intel services are a recurring revenue stream, so growth in these areas would be a very good thing indeed. 

Any upticks in the hardware business would be positive news, but I believe they are facing upgrade cycle challenges and I’m not expecting much on this front. 

Finally, I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw FEYE acquired by a larger player in the next few months. There have been multiple rounds of rumors over the last few years that indicate FEYE has hired an investment bank to assist with the process. While Mandia hasn’t confirmed these rumors, he hasn’t denied them either. Cisco allegedly passed. I think good candidates are Microsoft, IBM or even someone like CrowdStrike using their astronomically high share price to swing a deal and create a cyber powerhouse to rival Pali Alto.

Not looking for awards - I'm looking for this knowledge/idea to get out there. 

So a lot of the newbies and paper hands are getting spooked by the decreasing price, but it's not a bad thing because the volume of stocks traded are the same. At the end of the day, those stocks are owed to investors by the short-sellers irrespective of the price. The fact that there are virtually no stocks to be traded apart from the ones being traded to each other (i.e. inducing ladder attacks) is where the problem lies for them.

That is the key point; hedges still need to buy the stocks to close their over-shorted positions. A low price is instrumental in allowing people to buy stocks back and will enable those who missed the first spike to get back into the game. With everyone being able to buy stocks at a lower price, we may have the firepower needed to re-commence the buying of stocks and finally induce the MOASS due to their heavily shorted positions.

**THIS IS WHY THE NEWS IS SO ADAMANT ON SAYING THE REDDIT ARMY HAS MOVED ON; THEY DO NOT WANT INVESTORS TO BUY IN AT A LOWER PRICE AGAIN BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY ROYALLY SCREWED**. All their efforts will have been in vein and there will be even MORE longed stocks that are owed, thanks to investors who bough at that dip. This is why it is important to hold.

\- **Share Facts -**

* **FuboTV, ticker FUBO**
* **IV:** Around 200% this morning on puts expiring Feb-12th
* **FUBO earnings date:** Estimated to be Feb 5th
* **Share Float:** 52.06M (as per [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FUBO/key-statistics?p=FUBO))
* **Short % of Float:** 72.74% (as of Jan 15th, as per [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FUBO/key-statistics?p=FUBO))
   * I mention this because FUBO was heavily shorted when the stock rose in the $60’s, and unfortunately shorters succeeded in crashing the price.
* **Market Cap:** $2.85 B

**My position**

* 38 shares @ approx. $31
* 100 shares @ approx $43 bought this morning, and sold a covered call at $55 strike for $6.10 for Feb-12th. I'm sure I'll regret it, but the yield on both the call itself, and the potential yield if I get called away for downright phenomenal, hard to turn down.

&#x200B;

**- The DD -**

**What is FuboTV?**

Mama Wood said it herself (paraphrasing here): Cable is dying, to hell with cable, we want MOAR STREAMING!!!!!!!!!

Seriously, cable and television plans are dying. Nowadays you have a ton of flexible solutions, from the obvious Netflix and YouTube, to Amazon Prime, Sling TV, Hulu, etc. FUBO is capitalizing on this trend for sports fans. It is the country's first sports-first service. While the price might seem steep, it gives you access to dozens of regional, national and international sports channels, including live events in 4K HDR.

Beyond sports, it offers much more; 112 channels in total, including 43 of the top 50 Nielson-rated networks (for you autists and retards out there, Nielson is an American information, data and market measurement firm operating in over 100 countries and employing 44,000 people (says Wikipedia, I’m too retarded to do more research on them). Sample non-sports related channels on FUBO include: A&E, Adult Swim, AMC, BBC America, Bravo, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, etc. Yes, they even have the Weather Network.

**Recent acquisitions:**

No DD of a hyper fast growing company would be complete without discussing acquisitions.

* **Vigtory:** The company is in the process of acquiring and integrating Vigtory Inc to the platform. Vigtory is a sportsbook (sports betting). It will also remain available to those not using FuboTV (aka: additional revenues, but also additional marketing for FuboTV)
* **Balto:** Balto develops tools for users to organize and play fantasy sports games, and FuboTV intends to combine its technology with Balto to launch a free-to-play gaming offering.

**Some numbers (yes, the quant stuff):**

Average revenue per user (ARPU) has gone from $37.93 per month in 2019, to $53.73 in 2019, and to $67.70 in the latest quarter. In contrast, it’s average monthly cost per user has risen from $40.59 in 2018 to $56.78 in the last quarter. Yes, they were obviously operating at a loss, and yes they are now operating at a positive contribution profit. As of the latest quarter, they had 455,000 paid subcribers. Grand news, yes?

**Q3 results, and guidance for Q4:**

Spoiler alert: The numbers are fantastic.

* Q3: Revenues of $61.2 million, an increase of close to 50% on a YoY basis.
   * Breaking revenues down: Subscription revenues up by 64% at $53.4 million, and advertising revenues up by 153% at $7.5 million
   * Paid subscribers increased by 58% on a YoY basis, and ARPU increased by 14% on a YOY basis. [See here the meteoric rise](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201110005911/en/fuboTV-Announces-Q3-2020-Results). Sexy, ain’t it?
   * Hours spent watching FuboTV also skyrocketed, an increase of 83% YoY (133.3 million hours). Monthly Active Users watched on average 120h per month. This is a 20% increase YoY
* Q4 guidance: Spoiler alert: They raised their guidance mid quarter because they are so bloody awesome
   * Q4 revenue to be expected between $94 to $98 million, prior guidance was $80 to $85 million. The new guidance represents a 77% to 84% YoY revenue increase
   * Paid subscribers to be expected to exceed 545,000, prior guidance was 500k to 510k. The new guidance represents a 72% YoY increase.

**What now?**

Sure, they are not profitable yet. Big whoop, they are still young, FuboTV was founded in 2015. But you know what? It took ages for Netflix to become profitable (about 7 or 8 years, I believe). The way FUBO is growing their paid subscribers base, and the way the hours are increasing YoY, we can expect them to reach profitability sooner rather than later. When? I don’t have a crystal ball, if I do I’d be a billionaire. We can expect that as they continue to scale up and add more users, they will continue to increase their advertisement revenues (duh), and also that their cost of new client acquisition will become lower (also duh)

**What are the risks?**

* For FUBO to thrive and grow, they need live sports. COVID dented their growth due to professional sports suspending seasons. If we go into another massive lockdown (less and less likely as vaccines ever so slowly roll out), this could cause another dent in their growth.
* It’s still heavily shorted, as the price continues to go up (especially if they smash their guidance), expect some shady shit GME-style from hedge funds to bring the price down.

**TLDR:** Awesome growth potential, heavily shorted (not at the GME scale, but still heavily shorted so you need to be mindful of that and potential WSB attention to the stock, or potential shady business from shorters).

Now buckle up as I take you through the exhilarating world that is SEC regulations with regards to short selling and market manipulation as provided by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission!

&#x200B;

***Rule 201 – Short Sale Price Test Circuit Breaker***\*\*.\*\*     Requires trading centers to establish, maintain,    and  enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to  prevent the execution or display of a short sale at an impermissible price when a stock has triggered a circuit breaker by experiencing *a* **price decline of at least 10 percent in one day.** *Once the circuit  breaker in Rule 201 has been triggered, the price test restriction* ***will  app*****ly to short sale orders in that security for the remainder of the day**  **and the following day,** unless an exception applies.

*Rule 203(b)(1) and (2) – Locate Requirement*.  Regulation SHO requires a broker-dealer to have **reasonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed** so that it can be delivered on  the date delivery is due before effecting a short sale order in any  equity security.[\[7\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn7) **This “locate” must be made and documented prior to effecting the short sale.**

# Did brokers have a place where they ""reasonably"" believed they could get the shares from?

# Answer: FUCK NO

**Rule 204 – Close-out Requirement.** Rule 204 requires brokers and dealers that are participants of a registered clearing agency[\[8\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn8)to  take action to close out failure to deliver positions. Closing out     requires the broker or dealer to purchase or borrow securities of  like    kind and quantity. The participant must close out a failure to   deliver   for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of   regular   trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement   date,   referred to as T+4. If a participant has a failure to deliver   that the   participant can demonstrate on its books and records  resulted  from a   long sale, or that is attributable to bona fide market making activities, the participant must close out the failure  to deliver by  no   later than the beginning of regular trading hours on  the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date,  referred to as    T+6. If the position is not closed out, the broker or  dealer and any    broker or dealer for which it clears transactions (for  example, an    introducing broker)[\[9\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn9)**may  not effect further short sales in that security without borrowing    or  entering into a bona fide agreement to borrow the security (known  as    the “pre-borrowing” requirement) until the broker or dealer  purchases    shares to close out the position and the purchase clears and  settles**.   In  addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that    participants  of a registered clearing agency must immediately   purchase  shares to  close out failures to deliver in securities with   large and  persistent  failures to deliver, **referred to as “threshold securities,”** if the  failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.[\[10\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn10) **Threshold securities are equity securities**[**\[11\]**](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn11)**that  have an aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive     settlement days** at a registered clearing agency (e.g., National     Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)); **totaling 10,000 shares or more; and equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer's total shares outstanding.**    As  provided in Rule 203 of Regulation SHO, threshold securities are     included on a list disseminated by a self-regulatory organization     (“SRO”). Although as a result of compliance with Rule 204, generally a     participant’s fail to deliver positions will not remain for 13     consecutive settlement days, if, for whatever reason, a participant of a     registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a     registered clearing agency in a threshold security for 13 consecutive     settlement days, the requirement to close-out such position under Rule     203(b)(3) remains in effect.

# So, is GME a ""threshold security"" as defined by the SEC here:

* Outstanding Shares of GME:     \~ 69,750,000
* 0.5% of Outstanding GME Shares = \~300,000
* ""aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days"" = 2,351,180
* Is 2.3 million > 0.5% of Outstanding GME Shares **AND** is 2.3 million > 10,000 shares?

# Yea, it fucking is!

# Well, then they stopped issuing shorts until the previous ones closed position and settled, right..... RIGHT?!

( ...now go invest in silver)

I'm still reading through it myself, and make corrections and add to it as you see fit, but it seems that there have been violations of **SHO Rules 201,203, and 204. PLEASE CONTINUE TO DO THE DD and USE MINE and OTHERS posts to DO THE FUCKING SEC's JOB FOR THEM!!!!!**

&#x200B;

# IN CONCLUSION, HOLD THE FUCKING LINE!!!!!

&#x200B;

**TLDR;**

1. NO SHORTS should have been executed Thursday when GME dropped down to $132 because it fell more than 10%, or any of the other fucking days!!!!
2. No new shorts should have been issued because there's no reasonable belief that they could find actual stock to lend given 140% short float as reported from December, and I doubt they secured it PRIOR to issuing new stock
3. They should have already executed the failed to deliver shorts ASAP because of the high number of FTD's and the high number of shorted shares

Residents see housing values fall and panic, and think they need to sell to avoid being the last worthless house. You and Karen keep buying and selling the same set of houses at cheaper and cheaper prices. Some paper handed idiots sell their grandpa’s farm because FMV keeps tanking.

If the ladder attack is successful you and Karen buy all the houses on the cheap because you NEED them and you successfully tanked the housing market in GME.

If you and Karen are the smoothest brains in the world, people catch on, buy the houses you are discounting for cheaper and cheaper and you need to offer more and more and more to buy the property because everyone realized you NEEDED the houses and some retail autist bought the houses you were trying to tank on the cheap.

Eventually, after paying a shit ton of closing costs (Interest) on the houses you are making no progress in buying the actual property you need and you need to start paying the inflated housing values for the property.

Obligatory I am not a financial advisor, just a smooth brain neanderthal. 

I noticed a post earlier calling out the 3/19 $800 call options and the significant volume. I wanted to do some digging, below is my attempt to explain what *might* be going on. Constructive criticism and contrarian ideas are more than welcomed. 

Let's start with the numbers...there were a total of 29,935 contracts of the GME $800 calls traded across these 4 expirations. This is compared to only 9,106 of open interest (for all you autists out there that don't know, the open interest aka OI is how many contracts were open through yesterday). Tomorrow morning will be interesting to see if the OI increases or decreases...this will help us understand if some of that volume was opening new positions or closing existing ones but regardless, many of them *have to be opening* *new contracts* since the volume is 3x the OI. Proof below.

Why would there be so much volume today for the GME $800 calls across so many expirations? There's a lot of different reasons this could happen, let's conduct a process of elimination to hopefully follow Occam's Razor and see what is the most likely and/or most reasonable explanation. My first assumption is that hedge funds are responsible for the volume, too much $ for retail IMO. If I take the last price at market close of each contract and add it up, this is \~$57M...also note that these were all traded in small chunks throughout the day, no massive orders of 1,000 blocks or anything, largest is a hundred or so. They accumulated throughout the day so that $57M should be a conservative estimate. Perhaps these were traded in sweeps throughout the day to not get seen by option scanners?

I don't see a good reason why HF's would sell all these naked...could they collect premium on downward or flat movement of GME? Yes, but that seems like a poor method to do so since the delta stinks. It also exposes the seller to *massive* risk of having to sell shares should they end up ITM. It's like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller, just not worth the money...we know they don't have shares to sell, they need to buy shares to cover their shorts.

I also don't see why these would be covered calls where they own the underlying because DUH the whole point is they are trying to obtain shares of GME to cover.

If they weren't sold naked or covered, then they had to be bought, but why? Well...\~$57M isn't *that* much when you're down billions so far on your shorts. If GME's price can be driven down through short ladder attacks from HF's to shake out weak paper handed bitches, through artificially suppressed retail demand by Brokers and their fuckery,  and through the media's fear tactics, this means 2 *very important* things could be achieved: 1.) They can have GME's price be lower than it otherwise would to begin the squeeze en masse that they know is inevitable and 2.) they can recognize significant profit/hedging from their deep OTM calls options on the way up. 

The HF's were caught with their pants down and have been given the luxury of time and support from external actors (Fuck you, RH IBBK TD and every other shady broker and the media) to get their ducks in a row. They are trying to engineer the squeeze *on their terms* to reduce their losses. 

TLDR: There is a TON of GME $800 call volume across multiple strikes. Seems weird for them to be sold. Might be HF's plan to profit/hedge on way up once the real squeeze begins now that they have been able to grind GME down with short ladder attacks and artificially suppressed retail demand from asshole brokers.

TLDR: I think the options market is indicating that funds are committed to their GME shorts till March 2021. Ask yourself if you're willing to hold and outlast them. If the answer to that is yes, you can do something truly impactful here that ONLY GME can make happen. If the answer is no, then end the farce and accept that some people will go home winners, some people will go home losers, and the hedge funds will likely make most of their money back because that's what they do.

Aphria and Tilray Combine to Create Largest Global Cannabis Company With Pro Forma Revenue of C$874 Million 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201216005519/en/

>Under the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Aphria will receive 0.8381 shares of Tilray for each Aphria common share, while holders of Tilray shares will continue to hold their Tilray shares with no adjustment to their holdings. Upon the completion of the Arrangement, Aphria Shareholders will own approximately 62 percent of the outstanding Tilray Shares on a fully diluted basis, resulting in a reverse acquisition of Tilray, representing a premium of 23 percent based on the share price at market close on December 15, 2020 to Tilray shareholders. On a pro forma basis for the last twelve months reported by each company, the Combined Company would have had revenue of C$874 million (US$685 million).

The cannabis industry as a whole has extreme growth potential. I recently made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lab9sk/the_rolling_20s_leaps_on_cannabis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) illustrating my views on US Legalization & the opportunity with long term plays. We have entered the ~~roaring~~ rolling 20’s, where cannabis regulations will ease dramatically.

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Aphria & Tilray are slowly taking over Europe. 

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of Aphria, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face to create desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through CC Pharma, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**What is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is a leading German Pharmaceutical and Medical Cannabis Distributor that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

Last week, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group.

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Aphria/Tilray will be first in line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised to be the best.

Let this be a warning to all STOP PUTTING ALL FAITH INTO THE HIVE MIND AND DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. GME is clearly on SEC's ""failure to deliver list"" on every day provided meaning they are still most likely being shorted, but AMC is apparently cleared after the 12th meaning they are probably no longer being shorted.

January 4th - AMC - 111,844 shares @ $2.12

January 5th - AMC - 1,631,091 shares @ $2.01

January 7th - AMC - 4,241,943 shares @ $2.01

January 9-12th - AMC not on list

January 12th - AMC - 5900 shares @ $2.20

January 13-14th - AMC - not on list

I can see where the HYPE was coming from because apparently there was a failure to deliver 4M+ then 11M+ shares, but after that it looks like the ""shorters"" went on to short a much smaller supply. I guess there is still a possibility that the shorting continued, but I am having serious doubts. For those of you holding AMC, you might want to check into my claims to see that you and I got royally fucked. It's clearly not too big of a deficit if you need to sell, but you might want to sell if you have any profit left! unless you hold on to your shares with very little evidence of a future squeeze/potential (probably none). Maybe you'd like to hold onto until AMC becomes what they used to be (if that's possible), which I think I might do considering I bought in at 13 a piece. Anyway, hopefully this sparks a little controversy causing people to check my claim. I hope I'm wrong. BTW none of this is financial advise, do what you retards want

I'm definitely hanging on to my 1 GME and praying that bitch shoots to the moon

I believe people should view GME how they view startups and tech companies, with a focus on their future potential and how their fundamentals will enable or hinder growth, instead of focusing on their current price to earnings and short term volatility. I'm long on Gamestop because of changes in leadership, their new business strategy, and because their fundamentals are ***ACTUALLY*** ***PERFECT*** for company beginning to restructure and transform.

* Considering the pandemic and overall state of electronic retailers, let's compare [Gamestop](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638020000134/gme-20201031.htm) and [Best Buy](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/764478/000076447820000062/bby-20201031x10q.htm) fundamentals using their October 2020 10-Qs. BBY is much bigger than GME, isn't currently losing money, and no analysts are concerned about them going bankrupt, so how do their fundamentals compare? They both have relatively strong balance sheets for retailers in 2020, and both companies have almost identical quick ratios and networking capital ratios (.5 and 1.0). Their current distribution of their current assets is similar, but one huge positive for GME is that their current assets are 37.5% cash and about 50% inventory, which is great for companies beginning to restructure. A large cash balance grants the means to launch new company strategies, inventory obviously/hopefully means future revenue for retailers, and a conservative net AR balance in 2020 is likely for the best (not overestimating how much outstanding revenue can be collected). The majority of the current liabilities for GME are AP and accrued expenses, which is standard for commercial retail companies. However, it's more important to note relatively low levels of actual ***current*** debt, ***long term*** debt, and why the effect of operating leases on total liabilities is bullshit and stupid. [ASC 842](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/advocacy/policy-positions/leases-what-investors-need-to-know) changed how leases are accounted for effective January 2019, so operating leases are now shown as current and long term liabilities. So while GMEs debt to equity ratio looks significantly worse than Best Buys, I'd argue that its actually better. Getting out of an operating lease for a small store like Gamestop is pretty easy to negotiate or buy out, not easy to get out of a lease for the massive stores Best Buy leases. Also being F500 and having a huge market cap skewers D/E considerably. GME has a ton of cash, limited debt, and operating leases that that can be exited with ***some relative*** ease if needed, so Gamestop can restructure with plenty of breathing room.
* Looking at the income statement and cash flows, GME earnings are not awful given the conditions of brick and mortar stores during a pandemic. While Gamestop has a net income loss, they have good gross profits, and their gross margin is better than Best Buy. Gross margin indicates their core sales and costs of goods sold (costs directly related to revenue) are solid are fundamentally good. They just have too many general and administrative (non-revenue producing) expenses. I wonder what they could do to reduce overhead expenses of supplying and maintaining retail stores? Also, net income loss  and loss in cash flows from operating activity in October 2020 was less than 2019. So while it's definitely not ideal to see they losses, they made significant progress towards having a positive net income ***IN A PANDEMIC/RECESSION***, and this was still before the PS5 or Xbox Series X was released in November. GME had a positive total cash flow, but it was driven primarily from the sale of property and equipment. Sale of property and equipment is typically not a good sign for companies (think of a McDonalds not selling enough burgers so it starts selling off fryers for positive cash flow) but I believe it will be [good for them](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/making-stores-matter-in-a-multichannel-world#).  This is one of the first steps in their transformation to an online retailer, which I believe will ultimately make them profitable again. If you don't believe me, you can read exactly what their plan is.
* Ryan Cohen and other Chewy executives [did not invest and join the Gamestonk board](https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-adds-chewy-ryan-cohen-wall-street-darling-to-board-2021-1) for the lulz. They liked GMEs plan and the unique opportunity that Gamestop presents, kind of like all of us shitheads here. I think their involvement in the company will provide the necessary knowledge and experience needed to grow improve e-commerce sales. The business strategy from their October 2020 10-Q:

>**BUSINESS STRATEGY**  
>  
>In May of 2019, we announced our multi-year transformation initiative, which we refer to as GameStop Reboot to position GameStop on the correct strategic path and fully leverage our unique position and brand in the video game industry. Our strategic plan is anchored on the following tenets.  
>  
>***Optimize the core business.*** Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations across the organization, including cost restructuring, inventory management optimization, adding and growing high margin product categories, and rationalizing the global store base. Prioritizing efforts to optimize the store base and improve the fundamental operations of the business yielded the net closure of 321 stores in fiscal 2019, 461 stores year-to-date in fiscal 2020, and included both the divestiture of the Simply Mac business and wind down of underperforming operations in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Improved inventory management drove a significant increase in inventory turns and as a result, in working capital, while an intense focus on organization structure and expense reductions yielded a $315.9 reduction in reported Selling, General and Administrative costs year-to-date in fiscal 2020.  
>  
>***Build a frictionless digital ecosystem.*** Develop and deploy a frictionless consumer facing digital first omni-channel environment, including the recent relaunch and customer experience enhancements within GameStop.com, the launch of a completely new GameStop App, as well as the optimization of our retail store footprint to maximize our customer reach more broadly across all channels and provide them the full spectrum of content and access to products they desire, however, wherever and whenever they want to shop. Enhancements to the user shopping experience and improved omni-channel capabilities, including expanded delivery and payment options, yielded an increase in e-commerce sales of over 430% through the third fiscal quarter of 2020.  
>  
>***Become the social / cultural hub for gaming.*** Create the social and cultural hub for games and entertainment and expand GameStop’s addressable market through category and product expansion to offer the most comprehensive product offering across the GameStop omni-channel platform. Our customers are increasing their engagement across the spectrum of games, entertainment and technology and our focus remains to meet those expanding needs.  
>  
>***Transform vendor partnerships.*** Transform our vendor and partner relationships to unlock additional high-margin revenue streams through an expanded suite of product and service offerings to optimize the lifetime value of every customer.  
>  
>Connected to our transformation efforts, we have incurred and continue to incur severance, store closure costs and expenses for consultants and advisors. See ""Consolidated Results from Operations—Selling, General and Administrative Expenses"" for further information.  
>  
>We continually review and prioritize our capital needs and are committed to making investments in our infrastructure to drive our business plans and realize on our transformation initiatives. Key areas of investment include improving the presentation and content as well as the functionality, general search and navigation across our customer facing digital channels; improving customer data integration and customer relations management capabilities; continuing to enhance service offerings to our customers; continuing to strengthen and deepen our information technology, analytics, marketing and e-commerce groups; and creating more flexible fulfillment options designed to improve our delivery capabilities and reduce our shipping costs. These and other investments are expected to, among other things, provide a seamless and compelling customer experience across our omni-channel retail platform.

* I still think shorts did not cover, red days are meaningless short ladders, there's probably counterfeit shares floating around, and media fuckery trying to stop a huge squeeze. But ***totally forgetting*** all that for a second, when the fuck did every single analyst on wall street start believing that fundamentals are the only thing that matters looking at stock price? A ton of startups and tech companies that IPO trade wildly higher than their fundamentals. A big reason for this is the emerging potential of their industry and investor belief in executive leadership, look at Elon and renewable energy or Portnoy and mobile sports betting. Why should people treat a restructuring company with good liquidity, great executive leadership, and [in an emerging industry](https://www.statista.com/topics/868/video-games/#dossierSummary__chapter2) any differently than we treat exciting startups or tech companies that aren't profitable? What's the difference between a company going through a significant and well calculated transformation vs a young new company IPOing?
* Based on all of my fundamental analysis, I feel comfortable setting a price target and sell limit of $69,420.69, cause stonk. I'm so behind on my work from today because I can't stop thinking about gamestonk and watching the price and volume on Think or Swim. Diamond hands forever but I need a break for a few days. Let me know if my DD is shit, and someone please message me if we hit my PT this week and/or if Steve Cohen gets sent to Rikers, ty and power to the playerzzz

They've been illegally ""closing out"" their short positions and if we hold they will 100% get fucked. There is far more nefarious shit at play.**

So this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME. This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above ~120% short interest still. I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close >50% of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week. This got me digging around to figure out what's up.

I started by looking into GME failed to delivers (i.e. short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock) for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan, GME had ~1.2 MILLION failed to delivers. This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying.

What was interesting though, is that of that ~1.2million, ~700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period. I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months. It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road.

Having spent some time looking at the pattern, it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in, then a small chunk of coverage, then another large amount, and so on. To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article: https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf

In it, a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME:

""Assuming that XYZ (e.g. GME) is a hard to borrow security (e.g. apes holding strong), and that Trader A (Melvin), or its broker-dealer, is unable (apes again) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer’s close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as “reset transactions,” in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm’s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.""

It's almost like a play by play of what we've seen (in combination with the ladder attacks). My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th.

I 100% think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud. In fact, I would bet all my money on it - oh wait, I did 96 GME @ 290.

I am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail.

Not a financial adviser, I eat paint chips for dinner

EDIT: Ok, so I've been reading some comments and I wanted to clear a couple things up:

* The failed to deliver number is reported cumulatively. So if you sum everything for the Jan time period it'd come out incorrectly as 5 million. What I'm doing is summing all the *debits* to get an aggregate view of all the failed to delivers in the time range. This process is validated and discussed in other /r/wsb posts

* I know ETF's could have been redeemed by some MM's to gather up GME stock. However I'm not convinced there is enough GME held in ETF's to be a significant factor. Someone in the comments reported this amount to be about ~10M. We would know if a bunch of ETF's rebalanced and dumped GME.

* My number for the Ortex short interest was incorrect, I got mixed around when I wrote this initially. The short interest reported by Ortex on Friday morning was ~80%. The 120 figure for S3 was correct. 

* Please checkout the linked DD - it goes into much more detail and covers things far better than I can. 

* Share this post and the related DD. We need to hold wall street accountable if this is true and I think that starts by spreading the word. 

* I'm going to continue to dig into this tonight / tomorrow. Look forward to a new post tomorrow evening.

FOCUS ON GME**

I ran this calculation after seeing different AMC short interest figures on various websites. ***I believe true AMC short interest is actually 10-15%***, which is significantly lower than what Market Watch, Yahoo Finance, etc. are saying (79% on Market Watch, 38% on Yahoo Finance, at the time of writing this post).

**Since AMC's Q3’20 filing which was released on 11/05/20, they’ve issued a shit ton of shares through the below means, which I don't think these finance websites are accounting for:**

1. Raising $917mm in debt and equity through December and January; in a 1/22/201 filing they stated they had 287.3mm Class A shares outstanding ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/amc-says-bankruptcy-off-the-table-after-raising-more-than-900-million.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/amc-says-bankruptcy-off-the-table-after-raising-more-than-900-million.html))
2. Silver Lake Partners (a now past investor) converting their debt to equity and selling out last week, represented 44.2mm new Class A shares hitting the market ([https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake-idUSKBN29Z00E](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake-idUSKBN29Z00E))
3. Upcoming automatic conversion of Class B shares to Class A shares held by Dalian Wanda, a Chinese investor, represents 46.1mm new Class A shares that will hit the market soon (page S-18, [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf)).
4. Additionally, last week AMC filed to sell an additional 50mm Class A shares into the market ([http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf))

**Here is my calculation for short interest, including links to filings from the Company for reference:**

1. (A) 287,276,558 Class A Common Stock Outstanding as of 1/22/2021 + (B) 51,796,784 Class B Common Stock will automatically convert to Class A Common Stock at 1:1 ratio because on 12/14/2020 Dalian Wanda Group's holdings of Class B Common Stock fell to 30% of the aggregate number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock + (C) AMC filed to sell an additional 50,000,00 Class A Common Stock into the market -> [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf), page 1 and page S-18
2. Silver Lake Group converted $600mm of Convertible Senior Secured Notes into 44,422,860 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock. Silver Lake then sold all those shares into the market last week. 5,666,000 of the Class B Common Stock outstanding then got cancelled as part of this conversion -> [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/1517ecab-0e77-4700-bb90-b6ebb60e7648.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/1517ecab-0e77-4700-bb90-b6ebb60e7648.pdf), page 2 || [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/5fe2dc45-30a6-4e45-8c67-36015d973df1.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/5fe2dc45-30a6-4e45-8c67-36015d973df1.pdf), page 12
3. Looks like \~44.7mm shares are sold short
4. Total shares outstanding (excl. Wanda conversion and 50MM filing) = 287,276,558 + 44,422,860 = 331,699,418
5. Total shares outstanding (incl. Wanda conversion and 50MM filing (which they will probably complete given the high stock price)) = 331,699,418 + 51,796,784 - 5,666,000 + 50,000,000 = 427,830,202
6. Looks like \~3.0 shares are held by management / insiders, so float and short interest on #4 above = 328,704,636 / 13.6% short interest; and on #5 above = 424,835,420 / 10.5% short interest

***In summary, I think AMC is way overhyped and those looking for a short squeeze may still realize one, but at a much lower magnitude than they might believe. Focus should be on forcing the GME short squeeze, which still looks to have +100% short interest.***

Appreciate any and all discussion. My thoughts are my own, this is not financial advice.

&#x200B;

**Edit 1:** I updated the link reference for AMC filing to issue another 50mm shares into the market.

**Edit 2:**

I've been getting some questions on why Yahoo Finance and Market Watch are wrong. Here are my thoughts:

We are all using the same number of shares short, so it's a matter of how you calculate shares outstanding and float. My guess is these free, generic finance websites use a very standard method of calculating short interest and apply it to all companies. They're not reading through filings and fine-tuning their calculations to be specific to each company.

**Yahoo Finance** ([https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)): In Footnote 5, they state Shares Outstanding (and then I ASSUME Float as well) is based off the most recent quarterly or annual report. Their 287.28mm shares lines up with my #1. So it doesn't include Silver Lake's conversion of debt to equity, Dalian Wanda's upcoming conversion of Class B to Class A shares, or AMC's filing to sell an additional 50mm shares last week.

**Market Watch** ([https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)): I can't figure out how they calculate 56.57mm public float, but their shares outstanding are the same 287.28mm as my #1. So even in the worst case scenario, if you believe my more conservative shares outstanding calculation of 331.7mm (point #5 instead of #6 to be conservative), that's an extra 44.4mm shares, which when added to Market Watch's float of 56.57mm shares, equals 100.97mm shares in the float and thus 44.3% short interest, which is significantly lower than the 79.0% they're showing. But still, I don't necessarily agree with their float calculation and can't figure out how they get to 56.57mm."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|['AMC', 'GME']|['AMC', 'GME']|['AMC', 'AMC', 'FOCUS', 'ON', 'I', 'AMC', 'I', 'AMC', 'I', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'A', 'AMC', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'AMC', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'MM', 'MM', 'I', 'AMC', 'GME', 'I', 'AMC', 'I', 'SSUME', 'B', 'A', 'I', 'I']|['AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'GME', 'AMC']

Well, today was quite a day, both for the standard GME and for my new favorite stock, IFF. 

TLDR: Buy IFF, there is the potential for massive short squeeze; Gamma squeeze at $150; and earnings multiple expansion to due merger with a DuPont subsidiary.

Well, today IFF closed at $130, on strong volume. Interestingly, there we extremely strong resistance to the standard laser afternoon short ladder (started at 2:50pm). There must be a whale buying who chose or hold the stock above $130 for the close.

The further good news is there is still low volatility on this stock, so the options remain affordable, for now. 

And, in regards to the Feb 19 $150 strike calls, volume was 40,000 with 177,000 open. Will be interesting to see if those purchases were to for open interest, or was someone moving them down to March.

Overall, it is still looking good for a short squeeze, and it is only 15% away from a monster Gamma squeeze at $150.

So, yes, hold GME, yes, I know there are counterfeit GME shares. I don't see how the counterfeit shares will help me make money though. 

This one, on the other hand, I expect to rise rapidly, with a big pop up after it gets past $150.

Yes,of course I have positions on IFF.

Forget about squozes and voodoo ass candlesticks. *#Ben Graham gang #*. There was a great post re: the company's product line up [here](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0a1p5/the_full_dd_on_bb_an_elon_muskjeff_bezos_sandwich/), make sure to check that out if you haven’t already.

My approach is to look at $BB from a ***strategic*** financial lens. First off, multiples off earnings are misleading, esp. w/ a company like BB where one-time and nonrecurring items are present and where there is a premium for growth vs. steady-state earnings. So as any Wall street spreadsheet monkey would do, I spread some comparables on earnings. Basically – How does the market value similar businesses? ?

No shit BB is not a phone company anymore. They are, if you’ve been paying any attention at all, an endpoint protection company. What is endpoint protection? Endpoints are basically computers, phones, but massively now also IoT – Your smart TV is an endpoint, so is your dumb refrigerator now that has to connect to wifi, and terrifyingly so is your car, your airplane, and stuff where if shit goes wrong the result is worse than not being able to double fist another helping of chocolate ice cream.

Almost every electronic device at this point that relies on internet access is an endpoint, with corresponding security challenges. So what does this mean? It means we can take a look at ***other endpoint protection / digital security*** companies, see how the market values them, and see what that implies for $BB based on its own revenue.

See below a quick spread. Based on the revenue multiples currently ascribed to comparables to Blackberry, Blackberry has a target price of **at least** **$60 / share.** And this is only if it is the average of its peers. I believe it is better for all the reasons previous posters have mentioned.

https://preview.redd.it/4q73p1tjize61.png?width=635&format=png&auto=webp&s=863fed2b3532f8b371a88ecb7fc438cd52fe0216

Long story short – Blackberry already has the infrastructure, moat, and products in place for growth. **IF MORE PEOPLE PERCEIVED BLACKBERRY AS WHAT IT IS TODAY - A FUTURE-FACING ENDPOINT PROTECTION BUSINESS WITH GIANT ASS MOATS IN FANTASTIC END MARKETS (E.G. MOBILITY / TRANSPORT), ITS SHARES WOULD ROCKET, SIMPLY BASED ON WHERE “COMPARABLES” ARE TRADING.**

In other words, ***the Company is a diamond still with a coating of shit*** (lack of public understanding of its current business). ***In fact its inclusion as a simple meme stock may have only added an extra layer of shit***. John Chen (look up his resume), is a world class operator, and frankly almost too low key for his own good. Personally as an Asian, I sympathize – sometimes the community focuses too much on keeping their heads down to work hard, and less than they should on messaging! Imagine if he meme'd like Elon!!!

No matter how good (or bad) the fundamentals are, you need a catalyst for the stock to moon. So, although I think it was a mixed blessing for BB to have been part of the scrum last week, there is a high likelihood of an inflection point in the perception of the company these next few weeks. You also saw the post on [reflexivity](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/) (basically, stonks up can make company good, not just company good make stonks up).

The best part is - **even if it doesn't moon, $$BB will steadily grow and develop. Imagine -** **Base case of going into orbit, with extreme upside of potential based on what's going on in the markets right now. FOr those of you non-retards, that's called** **POSITIVE EXPECTED VALUE**\*\*.\*\* **YOu don't have to try to ""time the top"" with this stock, because it's got fundamentals / non-technical reasons supporting the stock.** ***There's a reason John Chen took his bonuses entirely in stock the last few years.***

**TLDR: $BB = Buy Blackberry.**

Disclaime r - My day job is actually private investing (so unlike many of you monkes I actually will have W2 income this year), I am still a retard. I just like the stock and have been 💎🤲 since 2018.

Imagine you’re John Chen. Sauntering down the hallway, with your 50 pound dick grazing the velveteen carpet with each step. You hear the guttural screams coming out of sales. You walk by the engineers, and gaze upon the latest widget as they kowtow before your bespecled grandeur. You hear about the customers who sing your praises, and the (much fewer) ones who tell you your product sucks donkey balls... But we (the retards @ WSB or frankly the dubmasses @ seeking alpha and even JP Morgan equity coverage) don’t know the details any of this, only dry ass reports that come out every quarter.

So, other than hacking into John’s brain (not recommended), what can we do? We can suckle at the teat of Twitter announcements, and sometimes that’s fun but usually it’s PR driven (unless it comes from Papa Chen’s account in which case suckle away).

But boy oh boy wouldn’t it be great if we could know the things P. Chiddy does. What new things are in development. Big new sales in the pipeline. Whether the company is hiring (or shrinking), and in what areas….Wait. For the last thing we actually can!

thanks to the grotesquely fat (and very rich, no offense Gabe) founder of a soul-crushing professional network called LinkedIn. Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So let’s see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?

To start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If you’re a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If you’re growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they don’t think they need, and last time I checked $BB’s CFO wasn’t completely retarded. Now, it’s important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c they’re growing, duh) and vice versa.

FANG isn’t a perfect comp (I’ll get to the others in a sec), but **serves as a good proxy of a “baseline growthy” tech.** No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking. See below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1g1ubpfxize61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=58d58b12644e9688e15e35e907386b910b9d938d

# IMPLICATION NUMBER #1 - $$BB COMPARES FAVORABLY TO FANG IN TERMS OF HEADCOUNT-IMPLIED GROWTH. IF YOU SAID “$BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG”, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOU’D BE RIGHT!!

“But wait,” you say. “growthinvestor123 you fucking idiot, [didn’t you just compare $BB to CRWD, ZS, SAIL, and PANW](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/) to justify a **$60 / share** price target for $BB? I want to see the ratios for those.” Ok you, got me. See below, headcount-implied growth is higher for endpoint security comparables.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eaz3begzize61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d01221903b3c50a6838710f32daa173035eb9e92

“Hah,” you say smugly. “Those other endpoint security businesses blow $BB out of the water, $BB sucks”.

No, you fucking idiot. If a simple headcount ratio without context was all it took I’d be rich instead of handsome like mommy tells me.

$BB went through [**round**](https://channeldailynews.com/news/layoffs-hit-blackberry-in-waterloo/28015) after [**round**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=blackberry+layoffs&atb=v224-1&ia=web&iai=r1-3&page=1&sexp=%7B%22cdrexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22artexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prodexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prdsdexp%22%3A%22c%22%2C%22biaexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22msvrtexp%22%3A%22b%22%7D) of painful layoffs as it shifted from being a handset business to what it is today. Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a **history**, and that is a blessing and a curse.

**Remember**, Daddy chen’s primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other??? And these smart monkes who were retained – Well, no need to make a job posting for that role anymore, right?

# IMPLICATION #2 – BLACKBERRY HAD > 20K EMPLOYEES. UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS. HAVING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES QUICKLY LIKE CERTAIN COMPETITORS

This brings me to the final part of our headcount analysis. Let’s look at those endpoint security comparables again. Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Let’s look at two two non-retard quotes –

***""I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company."" Steve Jobs***

***“If your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it’s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.” Peter Thiel***

I was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BB’s Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales. See below

&#x200B;

Even as a $BB bull, I didn’t expect the discrepancy to be so large.

# IMPLICATION #3 – BLACKBERRY ACTUALLY IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING / IT FOCUSED COMPANY RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS. IN MANY WAYS IT IS MORE OF A “START-UP”. EVEN WITH FINANCIAL PRESSURE, JOHNNY CHEN RETAINED TECHNICAL TALENT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE COMPANY’S FUTURE, AND VALUATION ???

**TLDR: BB IS NOT A ROCKET SHIP. IT IS A LONG RANGE SHUTTLE, CAPABLE OF BURSTS OF SPEED, PACKED TO THE GILLS WITH RETARDS AND TERRAFORMING EQUIPMENT AND HEADING TO MARS.**

**The Shorts - The Side Show**

Let’s be honest, the real reason anyone is in WSB right now is to fist shorts. BCRX, however, is also a company that needs to gap up to reach fair value.  Fist the shorts and hold the gains.

Biocryst has a high and steadily growing institutional ownership [currently reported at 71%](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bcrx/institutional-holdings). Biocryst has a float of 175m (124m of which are held by institutions), who are buying every share they can and not likely to sell any time soon.  This leaves 56m tradable shares. [The shorts have 30m shares or 70% of the tradable float.](http://nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=ShortInterest) This is not as big as the $GME naked short taken on by u/DeepFuckingValue. But, we think this is a stock that if it gaps up can hold the gain based on value. Institutions run an algorithm almost every day and short the stock (check the charts). We can make these fuckers squirm with the slightest effort.

**Orladeyo - The Prelude**

Orladeyo has recently been approved in the [US](https://biopharmajournal.com/2020/12/07/biocryst-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaqbcrx-receives-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-in-preventing-hae-attacks/) and [Japan](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/biocryst-bcrx-wins-japanese-approval-for-hae-drug-orladeyo-2021-01-25) to treat Hereditary Angioedema(European approval expected shortly). HAE is a rare disease that affects roughly 1/50,000 people, or about \~25,000 people in the three regions mentioned previously.

Orladeyo treats a rare disease and that means the medication is expensive. It costs [$485,000/year in the US](https://endpts.com/biocryst-wins-approval-for-hae-pill-and-charges-half-a-million-dollars-but-will-anyone-take-it/#:~:text=Six%20years%20after%20the%20FDA,BioCryst%20has%20notched%20another%20approval.&text=Despite%20inferior%20efficacy%2C%20BioCryst%20will,had%20projected%20a%20%24300%2C000%20tag.) and will roughly cost half of that in Japan and the EU. The company has projected they will capture 40% of the market [(page 15)](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/bcd71bf3-ef71-4803-81c4-edd4e33ebb38).  Capturing 40% of the market is a share price of [$70 when trading at a reasonable (if not conservative) 7x revenue multiple.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLvclUzTqCitwKfawL7kGCLquJxA2T7IJKLg52VWotE/edit?usp=sharing) Work your own numbers and you’ll find SP should be more than $9 and the current market cap of 1.6 billion. FDA approval of Orladeyo enabled BioCryst to cross a bridge from a small unprofitable research company to expanding [commercial biotech](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393550-biocryst-time-to-switch-hats-mid-cap-fits-now-maybe-large-cap) now engaged in execution.

**Factor D -  The Main Event**

Factor D is the blockbuster.  Full stop.  The company is already pursuing PNH but has indicated their intended subsequent targets for this drug. They’re small targets like “Lupus” and “IGA Nephropathy” along with[ 6 others (page 24)](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/41ee0771-0acc-479e-a39e-2842101c6aa9) and it’s already being hailed as [“best in class”](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3087617&headline=BCRX-BioCryst-has-potential-bestinclass-PNH-treatment-says-JMP-Securities)

So what’s this look like money wise?  Alexion’s drugs SOLIRIS® and ULTOMIRIS® are the current treatment for PNH those [make up 4.3B of their 5B revenues.](https://ir.alexion.com/node/22191/pdf)  AstraZeneca just bought them out for a whopping 39B.  If Factor D receives same valuation, that alone puts SP at $222 given our float.  [The sky is truly the limit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLvclUzTqCitwKfawL7kGCLquJxA2T7IJKLg52VWotE/edit?usp=sharing) over the next 24-48 months.  The point is, the company is ready to gap up on merit, but is being held back by high short activity.

**Galidesivir - The Wild Card**

If you aren’t already excited, maybe you’ll be excited by a drug [that provides 90% protection against Ebola](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320203179_Efficacy_of_Galidesivir_against_Ebola_Virus_Disease_in_Rhesus_Monkeys) when dosed 72 hours post exposure. Huge Ebola outbreak? BioTerror attack in a major city?  Think humanity might end in a pandemic more lethal than covid with people hemorrhaging blood from their eyes? No problem. Just distribute the [galidesivir](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/galidesivir) and most everyone will be protected. (Animal studies suggest high protection against [Zika](https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/4/suppl_1/S55/4294108), Yellow Fever, Marburg, [Tick Borne Encephalitis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31142664/) and others). 

Why didn’t we already have this drug?  That’s anyone’s guess, but politics seems to have something to do with it.  No one can yet determine the value or ultimate use of galidesivir as it is tied up in government development contracts. The company has already [stated](https://ir.biocryst.com/events/event-details/biocryst-third-quarter-2020-conference-call) that it is developing galidesivir for government contracts and shareholders seem to have little to do with this. So, we’ll just call this the sleeping wild card.

**FOP- The Feel Good Drug**

This is not a money maker. But, in case you haven’t found a soft spot for this company, they appear close to a first time cure for an extremely rare disease called [FOP](https://www.biocryst.com/our-pipeline/fop-program/). It slowly (and painfully) cripples children when their joints fuse together with excess bone. Children affected by FOP often end up wheelchair bound by age 11. Can’t tell you this drug will be a money maker as the affected population is too small. But, gosh, don’t you want the company to succeed?

**The Competition - The Class Clowns**

Disease:  Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)

For the prophylactic (preventative) market, the competitors are Cinryze, Takhzyro (from Takeda) which are IVF and subcutaneous injections respectively. Haegarda (CSL Behring) has a subcutaneous injection as well. Orladeyo recently received [FDA approval](https://biopharmajournal.com/2020/12/07/biocryst-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaqbcrx-receives-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-in-preventing-hae-attacks/) to be the first and only oral prophylactic treatment for HAE.

The patents of the competitors expire in 2032 and no generics are expected on the market before 2032. Orladeyo was granted extended patent protection until [2037](https://ir.biocryst.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-composition-matter-patent-allowance-extends-protection). [Royalty Pharma](https://www.royaltypharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/royalty-pharma-acquires-royalty-interest-orladeyo-and-bcx9930) did a deep dive on BioCryst’s expected Orladeyo revenues when it agreed to royalty financing that enabled BCRX to fast track Factor D development and expand it to 8 clinical indications.  

Disease: Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) 

Alexion holds the sole drug Soliris and its spin off Ultomiris (both IVF C5 inhibitors) to treat the rare blood disorder PNH. Alexion has market exclusivity until 2025 for Soliris. [This activist letter ](http://www.elliottletters.com/alexion.pdf)and [this article](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/alexion-moves-from-cfo-clancy-and-his-legendary-caution-does-mean-more-m-a-coming) highlight that analysts believe the 39B purchase of Alexion was a fire sale due to mismanagement. If Factor D received at least the same discounted valuation as ALXN, that would mean its market cap would increase from 1.6B to 39B. Excited?

Factor D is expected not just to be equivalent to Soliris, but exceed it. BioCryst Medical Director Bill Sheridan believes Factor D will make competitors [“obsolete”](https://ir.biocryst.com/events/event-details/39th-annual-jp-morgan-healthcare-conference) as it cures patients earlier in the disease process than C5 and C3 inhibitors. Unlike competitors, Factor D will also be both an oral pill \*and\* a monotherapy. In other words, there’s not much competition. Also, PNH is only the first of 8 serious illnesses expected to be treated by Factor D.

**The Insiders**

Still not convinced? CFO Anthony Doyle joined BioCryst April 02, 2020. Four months after joining the company he used $220,320 of his own money to [purchase shares in BioCryst ATM.](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1808688.htm) As he is mortal like the rest of us, we assume CFO Anthony Doyle also pays taxes. Therefore, it appears as if he put the entirety of his after tax salary, for a whole year, into aligning himself with shareholders. Famed biotech investor Alex Denner has also been accumulating a passive position, ATM, right next to retail, [as recently as a couple weeks ago](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-bcrx-biocryst-pharmaceuticals-sarissa-capital-management-lp-sc-13g-2021-january-25-18652).

**Too Many Good Things?**

BCRX researched small molecules and crystalline structures for years.

**No More Shareholder Dilutions**

If your interest is perking, you’ll be happy to hear CEO John Stonehouse [promised(listen to question and answer section)](https://ir.biocryst.com/events/event-details/39th-annual-jp-morgan-healthcare-conference) there will be no shareholder dilutions, as all company operations are funded into 2023.

Here’s some DD for anybody who doesn’t eat breath and sleep only GME.


eBay, like most other online retailers, are going to have ludicrous numbers in this last quarter due to the holiday season. That’s just a given. 


I am an experienced eBay seller who on a weekly basis for the last few years, sells around 15-20 items. The last few months was ridiculous. Items which were posted that would have around 10 bids and 5-15 watchers, would have 25-30 with 20+ bids. The views on each item was double to tripe from early November until pretty much the last two weeks. 


Lots of volume, lots of selling, lots of 10% commissions for eBay. Now we all saw what happened with Apple, posting 100+ Billion in revenue this last earnings report and being down 3% the next day. That shit happens, I’m not a psychic with a magic ball. If the market is tanking, the market is tanking. Look at it this week. But I will say this, the volume on eBay isn’t why I’m going fucking hard in the calls. Here’s the real cherry on top:

eBay has now finally implemented a payment policy they have been working on for a long time. Every single one of my sales went through PayPal, along with everybody else. Every single god damn transaction PayPal got their dirty little claws into. Since I think like the beginning of eBay, it’s just been a given that they give PayPal millions of dollars every month to run their transactions.


Well guess what you mother fucker. Shit had changed. Since they have now implemented their STRAIGHT TO BANK ACCOUNT POLICY, PayPal doesn’t even exist. The money goes, you guessed it, straight to your account. They even have their own return feature which they deal with themselves now, instead of putting funds into hold on PayPal. eBay allows you to chose when you get paid and in what frequency. For example, I have mine setup for each Tuesday of every week. 

This is going to and has already saved them MILLIONS in fees. Papa Musk has already moved on from PayPal, it’s time we do the same.


Oh, did I mention all the new payment platforms introduced as well? I bought a Pokémon card the other day without gay as shit PayPal but through god damn Apple Pay. It was way too easy. You can also link credit cards, bank accounts, whatever. It’s 2021.


eBay posts earnings in a few days, Wednesday after close. Do what you want. If the stock goes down, call me a retard and make fun of me. If the stock goes up, fuck off and thank me later. Look at what it did today. I’ll probably sell a third of my calls on Wednesday for an IV hedge as well. Play at your own risk.

I came across TSM Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturers which had just over 50% market share. Their biggest customer is Apple. 

https://csimarket.com/stocks/competitionSEG2.php?code=TSM

Now, I couldn’t believe the numbers I saw for TSM. I figured every site was wrong because the following cannot possibly be true: 
Market Cap- 571 billion
2020 revenue - 1.4 Trillion (yes trillion). the revenue is up 30% from 2019 (yes during a pandemic). 
Earnings- 530billion.  

This means that they are trading at 1:1 P/E ratio. 

Compare that to AMD (106bil market cap - 2.5billion earnings - 38 P/E and NVDA 321marketcap - 2.8bil earnings - 140 P/E.
Intel has market cap of $230bil - $20bil earnings - 11 p/E

So shouldn’t TSM have a market cap of at least 5 trillion?? How is no one talking about the fact that their revenue during a pandemic is 1.4 trillion with profit margin of 40%??? 

I think there are some seriously sweet tendies to be made. The IV is pretty low and you can get 2022 calls with a 200 strike for $5. Or a 2023 call with 200strike for $12. 

Someone please explain how this is possible and what I am missing. This is a no brainer. 

Also, for the first time ever, TSM will be building a plant in the USA

They began launching the ""McPlant"" in Denmark and Sweden this month.

A friend of mine discovered the ingredients list of the McPant, Mcdonalds big new plant based burger. He cross examained it agianst the BYND meat burger, note...Mcdonalds and BYND have yet to anounce any partnerships on their McPlant Burger. After futher examination and many hours of labor he established the first ever ""Meatless Meat Comparison Chart"" or MMCC.

As you can see from the results, he found that there is a 87.5% match in raw ingredients which emcompasses both the Beyond Burger and McPlant Burger. This essentially means there's a partnership with McDonalds and Beyond which is yet to be announced or discovered. The proposed theory is Beyond Meat will be supplying all of the McPlant Burgers in a massive deal.

Feel free to do what ever you want with this information. Shout out to my friend doing all the DD, totally not financial advice in any way.

I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I barely understand how the stock market works. Professionally I'm a network security researcher -- my job is to find and explain vulnerabilities in other complicated systems that my smooth brain barely understands.

Guess what you fucking idiot -- you aren't allowed to collapse the entire financial market in less than a week using a phone app. It takes more time.

---------

# There are likely several million new synthetic longs of $GME, diluting the market, that were created on 01/28/21.

They were created by a market maker (or possibly several market makers) to stop the beginning of a short squeeze that would have bankrupted hedge funds if a margin call hit them, which ultimately could have financially impacted those market makers once liability for the shares was transferred. These shares weren't borrowed from anyone. They're imaginary. Pure fiction. A promise only a handful of entities can make.

The reason they did this was to buy time to save their own asses. [The reason they were allowed to do this is because regulations let them](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html).

The creators of those shares have 21 days to deliver. Until then, they aren't paying interest. There isn't a public record of their creation -- the closest insight we have to the number of synthetic longs in existence for $GME are the [failure-to-deliver numbers](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/), and $GME is a major outlier in that field. A fucking terrifying outlier.

We aren't bleeding out a hedge fund by holding. Melvin very likely *is* out of their position after losing half of their fund. There aren't 'new shorts replacing the old'. Instead, a buffer of imaginary stock was created by a market maker to 'flatten the curve' when a massive number of shorts had to cover once retail buyers started rushing in.

---------

# That's why you aren't seeing short interest increase even though there aren't any short shares left to borrow.

**These assholes are praying that in the next month, retail buyers get scared, bored, or distracted.** They're spreading FUD, attacking with short ladders, hoping you watch the short interest drop and think it's over. They're counting on you to sell your $GME at a bargain rate so you can pay rent, because they think *you're just fucking retail scum betting on a shit company,* and they've been playing this game longer than you've been alive.

They're also counting on you to obsess over things you can measure that they can hide. They want you to set rules and limits on when you're going to run away.

---------

# Simultaneous to the creation of these synthetic longs, DTCC increased collateral requirements on 01/28/21 to purchase $GME to 100%.

This led smaller brokers like Robinhood to restrict trading, depressing the price, conveniently making it less expensive for market makers to recover their synthetic longs. 

**The people that pushed this collateral increase knew exactly what would happen**, because *it's their job* to know what the impact will be when they make changes like this.

DTCC openly stated they increased collateral requirements for $GME to reduce risk to their organization. **DTCC recognized financial liability in this squeeze could eventually reach clearinghouses if the market makers went bankrupt.** They know exactly what the failure-to-deliver numbers mean for this security. 

It's possible that DTCC created new collateral requirements in coordination with the flood of synthetic longs explicitly to make it easier to recover those shares. It is also possible these actions were taken without any coordination with market makers, because DTCC knows it could have dampened and stretched out a squeeze through this act alone.

**Their strategy is to stretch out a short squeeze into a 'long high' they can recover from if retail shares are sold over time, since retail can't buy them back.**

And the people working at DTCC likely rationalized this was 'the right thing to do' -- to prevent a systemic failure that could have impacted the entire stock market -- because preventing systemic failures is the only reason organizations like DTCC exist.

Meanwhile, Robinhood -- the smallest player in the game -- honestly DTCC's buttboy in this scheme -- is going to be grilled by Congress over this shit.

---------

# Did you think we were the only ones that saw a black swan event coming when we bought shares?

The root problem is there are several players in the market capable of creating new shares without paying interest, capable of restricting trading -- and they all face severe financial liabilities if a squeeze happens. They want to turn the squeeze into a slow burn so the damage doesn't hit them.

If we continue to hold, a squeeze could happen sometime around or after Feb 18th, or another market maker could create *even more* synthetic longs to dilute the market, passing the hot potato. This could make their problem even worse once *those shares* are bought and held.

This could continue for an extremely long period of time until a financial regulator steps in and forces them to buy the shares they've sold.

---------

**TL;DR**: 

WSB is being made into a fall guy for the collapse of the market due to the creation of a massive number of preexisting synthetic longs that were bought and held. To fix it, market makers decided to make more, but their cure is also a poison they can't stop taking.

**Strategy**: 

Hold your positions, buy at any price you can afford to hold forever, and hope that retail owns more shares than the total number that exist for $GME. Contact the SEC and ask them to investigate and to halt trading of $GME -- time is on your side if the clock ticks down the deadlines for market makers, while the stock cannot be sold by paper hands.

This is not financial advice, blah blah blah, suck my dick SEC.

&#x200B;

Simply put, the S3 Short Interest data is probably fairly accurate. But it's not answering the relevant question.

&#x200B;

Anyone with any statistical background knows that asking the right question is as important as any analysis you do.

&#x200B;

For short interest there are two relevant questions:

1. What is the net exposure to a short in a hedge fund's portfolio?
2. How many shares still have yet to be bought that must be bought in order to cover?

&#x200B;

It is my belief that S3's data is answering the first question but not the second.

&#x200B;

Lately there has been a significant increase in volume for super OTM puts and super OTM calls. Selling a put is a bullish position and buying a call is a bullish position. However, the shares associated with these positions ARE NOT NECESSARILY PURCHASED YET. This is particularly true for selling a naked put.

&#x200B;

My thought is that hedge funds have begun selling a FUCK TON of otm naked puts. This creates some revenue for them and also, on paper, effectively closest their exposure to a short position. So, if you're short 100 shares and you sell a put (taking on the obligation to buy 100 shares at a certain, low, price, if the contract is exercised) you are effectively hedged. Thus as long as that contract is open, it may appear to S3's algorithms that the position is closed.

&#x200B;

The problem arises because those 100 shares linked to the sold put ARE NOT purchased yet if the hedge funds are selling naked puts. They are just floating about. So while the net exposure to short positions is reduced, the need to buy shares has not been alleviated.

&#x200B;

Perhaps the squeeze has been squoze. Perhaps not.

&#x200B;

I would appreciate any feedback that people have. I'm trying to determine for myself how plausible this is. Maybe I've got some brain wrinkles.

The float is only 50.65M shares.

There's 8.1M WSB degenerates.

Let's throw out some scenarios to show how we (just the WSB degenerates), not even counting the rest of retail, could in fact own 100% of the float -

1. Every degenerate owns GME (yes I know that's not at all realistic) -50.65M / 8.1M = 6.33 shares/degenerate
2. If only 50% of the degenerates own GME -50.65M / .50(8.1M) = 12.51 shares/each
3. If only 25% of the degenerates own GME -50.65M / .25(8.1M) = 25.01 shares/each
4. If only 10% of the degenerates own GME -50.65M / .10(8.1M) = 62.53 shares/each

Let that sink in. Yes I know a lot of you have much more than than 62.53 shares, and a lot have only 1 or 2 shares (or even a fraction of a share).

This doesn't take into account all of the retail that is not even on WSB that owns GME.

This doesn't take into account all of the shares Cohen and others have bought up.

Bottom line, we, retail, degenerates, autists, & retards, likely own nearly ALL OF THE FLOAT.

Hedge funds bought up the rest, holding it to squeeze their fellow assholes along with us.

TL;DR -  BB 🚀🚀Blackberry has an architecturally secure embedded operating system compared to competitors, safety and security are important for electric vehicles, military use, and future IoT devices, I am holding 2000 shares of blackberry and suggest you buy to hold for longterm gains.  🚀🚀

I'm a cybersecurity sector employee. I have previously brought you detailed analysis surrounding the capabilities of [Palantir](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l07ly5/dd_pltr_foundry_explanation_from_reformed_data/), [FireEye](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laki1v/feye_playing_tomorrows_fireeye_q4_earnings_based/) (check comments), and other cybersecurity vendors here in WSB. I have also written a [guide to understanding how propaganda and misinformation campaigns are being used to manipulate retail investors](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l928lr/obfuscation_misinformation_propaganda_and_gme/) and what you can do to help yourself.

Anyway, moving past establishing credibility, here is my analysis on why I am bullish about the security posture surrounding the Blackberry QNX operating system in comparison to other competitors in the embedded RTOS environment.

# What is RTOS

RTOS is Real-Time Operating System. Most operating systems do not need to perform tasks within predictable computation timeframes, as we tend not to notice any performance difference. This is why it takes either 7 minutes or 11 lifetimes to download Winrar. With an RTOS, the primary applications are time-sensitive or mission-critical operating systems. These include power plants, water treatment facilities, dams, vehicles, drones, and further applications. If your system does not operate in a predictable fashion within set timeframes and capacities, you cannot rely on it for ensuring your dam doesn't overflow, your autonomous vehicles does not crash, or your drone can stay afloat in the air.

# Start with Monolithic OS

Most RTOS are monolithic as far as their OS architecture goes. Generally, systems are built into Kernel and User land. A monolith tends to control all system management within Kernel-land with user applications running in Userland. The issue with this approach is reliability. Any individual failure can potentially crash the OS, which is an unacceptable condition for many of the above applications.

In addition, trying to modify the monolithic OS is difficult to do without a complete shutdown. Shutting down a drone or train mid-journey is not feasible. For cybersecurity purposes, the attack surface is enormous as any individual part of the system (including applications) can affect the reliability of the OS.

Good news is that they're more performant though!

# MicroKernel

QNX is a MicroKernel architecture. The MicroKernel only does process isolation / memory management / task switching. All other standard OS operations (file system, drivers, networking, etc) are performed in UserLand instead.

This architecture is useful because it means that:

* Individual component failures will not compromise the entire OS. So for drones, a bug in a camera application or in the network traffic will not affect the flight of the drone. This is pertinent in the context of power plants, dams, military equipment, and autonomous/electric vehicles.
* When a component fails, it is easy to detect the point of failure. Monolithic kernels are difficult to trace faults in, especially as services get coupled together.
* Live restoration, if a component fails it can be restored without taking the system offline.
* Isolation, processes do not share memory or processing space, preventing many classes of memory manipulation bugs / security flaws such as buffer overflows, use after free, etc.
* Systems can be built to scale or share workload across multiple Userland apps, potentially preventing the crash entirely at the cost of degraded performance.

So look, the architecture of the QNX system puts it in a great position compared to other monolithic kernels in the embedded OS space.

# Key QNX benefits

Memory Protection - Typically, an OS assigns a block of memory to a process for it to store either data or instructions. QNX assigns a process a block of virtual memory, that is then mapped to physical memory with spatial separation between each block. This means that you cannot reliably change the operation of the program or read the data effectively when given physical access. Sure, ASLR, Canaries, and the Guard space do exist in modern OS's, but in embedded space memory is much tighter so this is a key benefit!

CPU Scheduling - CPU's use a variety of scheduling algorithms to give processes different weights for execution. This can become problematic when critical processes end up being stalled because low priority processes are hogging CPU time due to bugs or manipulation (such as regex backtracking for validation). QNX uses adaptive partioning which basically enforces that each application is partitioned to have a predetermined set of resources such as memory, filespace, or cpu time. This makes it difficult to starve any particular critical process of resources.

Safety & Compliance - The OS has pre-configured designs ready for compliance with EC 61508 (industrial), IEC 61511, EN 50128 (rail), IEC 62304 (medical) or ISO 26262 (automotive) industry standards. These are rigorous engineering standards that are designed to enforce strict safety measures, monitoring for faults, and procedures for operating. Compliance with any of these is a long and arduous process, which BB has been working on for a long time. Other embedded system vendors have not met these standards yet, or have only chosen to focus on their key industries.

Security - Normal Standards like secure boot, integrity validation of all programs prior to execution, address space validation, application isolation and sandboxing, data and network and inter-process access control, and execution of everything from userland (no root) are all other benefits I don't have time to get too deep into.

This is a good blogpost that details how the microkernel is able to quickly identify deviations from the standard, apply logging, and pinpoint where to analyze further for performance or security remediation.

[https://devblog.blackberry.com/en/2020/04/securing-the-clipboard](https://devblog.blackberry.com/en/2020/04/securing-the-clipboard)

This was in response to an iOS update that showed when applications were accessing a users clipboard. Tiktok and facebook were accessing the clipboard p. much every second. Conspiracy theorists would say that Tiktok was harvesting user clipboard data hoping for PII or credentials. Regardless, BB was prepared for this attack vector already as demonstrated by this quick blog post as a response.

[https://devblog.blackberry.com/en/2019/10/https-versus-blackberry-spark-communication-service](https://devblog.blackberry.com/en/2019/10/https-versus-blackberry-spark-communication-service)

Building their own competitor to TLS, the standard for secure web communication. The web's based off of a Request/Response model, but BB allows for PubSub, Voice, and Video amongst other secure data transmission methods. Looking into their encryption algorithm support, Argon2 stands out as it is a relatively recent (with low uptake) hashing algorithm.

# Summary

Overall, hope this gives you some confidence that BB are market leaders in the embedded OS space, as the microkernel architecture does set them apart when compared to competitors in the business, and their existing big enterprise relationships and 100% certification and compliance to safety/security standards should get them into many new critical infrastructure, military, drone, and electric vehicle embedded systems.

The biggest EV automaker is TESLA. Tesla is huge in demand, its factories is set up in Nevada. They all NEED LITHIUM to power their cars up.

$LAC lithium americas corp just got approval from govt for lithium mining in Thacker Pass. Thacker pass has the most lithium deposit in USA and its located in nevada and its merely only 200 miles away from Tesla factories. $LAC already mining lithium in the Argentina and few other places so they are already know what they are doing and own thacker pass location in Nevada.

They are projected to start mining lithium in January 2022 and construction is almost complete as much as 60 percent. They are now signing. parnerships which are under NDA and I reckon one of the partnerships is TESLA and other big automakers such as GM, Ford, Toyota etc.

Currently we dont have biggest lithium miners in US, so in order to rise big in this revolution, US govt is helping $LAC and probabaly $LAC being the biggest lithium miner in US is a great thing for its economy and its automakers economy. Lithium americas currently raised 400 million dollars at average price of $22, currently its trading under that, so its a discount for you, but it wont stay longer. Once the partnerships are announced, it will rise big, now is the time to buy and hold.

Lithium is the new oil, This is easily can go 40s --> 50s --> 60 ---> after the launch easily can be trading may be even north of 100s. If your grandfather or dad missed on OIL investment, this is the best thing up and running now, so now is the time to give a second look. Check out $LAC.

**Math Time:** In thinking about value, we hppen to enjoy simple convenience of a Nice Round Number. 101 million shares Outstanding. A $2 billion Market cap (almost exactly) $20 per share, $3 billion @ $30 per share and so on OR $40 per share to reach 4 bilion market cap. To ask ""is it possible $LAC could hit $40??????? ---> is to ask , could market could ever hit $4 billion.

In assesing value more specically, we can also enjoy the simplicity of approaching the company as sum of its part on two primary assets: 49 % interest in the Causchari-Olaroz brine project in Jujuy Province, Argentina (""CO"") AND a 100 % Interest in the Thacker Pass project in Nevada USA (""TP"")

Construction of CP is over 60 % COMPLETE already, and fully capitalized. Construction will complete Q4 2021, AND Lithium Production will begin Q1 January 2022 (11 months from now) at 2 Million Tons proven and probable reserve of battery grade lithium in Carbonate equivalent (""LCE""). Production capacity of 40,000 tons per annum (""TPA""). Operating cost of $3.579/Ton. A 40 year project Life.

Construction of TP, of course, has not started but underlying resource is well documented. 3.1 Million tons of LCE proven and probable. Production Capacity of 60,000 tpa. Operating Cost of Around $4,000/Ton. A 46 year project life.

Conservatively 80,000 Tpa of LCE X $12Lk/ton (LAC's assumed avg price) = $ 960 Million revenue minus $4k/ton (high end of cost of production) = $640 million EBITDA. But in my opinion, thats too LOW. We are on precipice of unprecedented surge in worldwide demand for LCE. Experts say Demand will in crease 10x IN Ten years, Some are saying 6x demand will increase by 2024 alone. LEC prices have already risen 50 % in 6 months but are still very depressed. If LCE recovers just to 2018 levels ($25k/Ton): 80k Tpax$25k/ton= 2.0 Billion revenue, $1.6 billion EBITDA.

As for what multiple should apply to these figures, your guess is as good as mine. For illustration, ALB boasts $ 3.34 Billion revenue, $853 EBITDA, A $19.18 billion Market Cap, fetching a trailing price/sales of 5.91, SQM has 1.78 billion revenue, $572 m EBITDA, a $14.87 billion Market cap, fetching a P/S 8.37. May be $LAC is lower, or higher, or somewhere in between. i leave it greater minds of Fellows here than my own mind to Project.

But if (1) despite Surging demand LCE Spot prices never rise a penny above $12k/ton and (2) we apply a very low 5x sales ration, fair value of LAC could be $4.8 billion , i.e $48/share. If LCE price recover to 2018 elvels we keep the same low 5x sales ratio fair price for LAC could be 10 billion, i.e $100/share. iF lac Fetches the same multiple as SQM (8.37 x sales) we get $16.74 Billion i.e $167/share. And if Worldwide Demand for battery grade lithium Carbonate Rockets beyond supply as anyone paying attention predicts it will.....That friends, is when ""2 DA MOON"" starts to sound apt."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082633.csv|DueDiligence|['$LAC', 'GGEST']|[]|['EV', 'EV', 'TESLA', 'NEED', 'THIUM', '$LAC', 'USA', '$LAC', 'NDA', 'I', 'TESLA', 'GM', 'US', 'US', '$LAC', '$LAC', 'US', 'OIL', '$LAC', 'A', 'OR', '$LAC', 'AND', 'USA', 'CP', 'PLETE', 'AND', 'A', 'TP', 'LCE', 'A', 'LCE', 'X', 'BITDA', 'LOW', 'LCE', 'IN', 'LEC', 'LCE', 'BITDA', 'ALB', 'BITDA', 'A', 'SQM', 'BITDA', 'S', '$LAC', 'LCE', 'LAC', 'LCE', 'LAC', 'F', 'SQM', 'DA']|['GM', 'CP', 'ALB', 'SQM', 'F', 'SQM']

I posted this TWNK long thesis in r/stocks, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lafmq2/long_thesis_on_hostess_brands_twnk_owner_of/), but think it has a home in r/options as well given the 15% short interest, low IV, cheap options, and potential for gamma squeeze. Appreciate any and all thoughts.

# TL;DR

**Hostess Brands (TWNK)** has high (\~15%) short interest (more than AMC or BB) setting the stage for a short squeeze, additional upside from a gamma squeeze, is an iconic brand, AND has a fundamentally sound business with strong cash flows and organic growth trading at a reasonable valuation. ***Not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade.***

# Intro

Sup guys. So I know a bunch of us are now looking for the next big opportunity to pile into. Unfortunately we probably won’t see a squeeze of GME’s magnitude for awhile since that kind of short interest is insanely rare, but I think we might have found an opportunity that is pretty low hanging fruit AND is significantly better relative value than the other names people are piling into. It has what the finance community call “asymmetric upside” (more upside potential than downside risk), for the reasons I’ll describe below.

**So what’s the target?** ***Hostess Brands (NASDAQ: TWNK)***. You probably know them as the company that makes Twinkies, but they also make Cupcakes, DingDongs, HoHos, Donettes and Zingers (can’t make this up)…

For some historical context, the company was private-equity owned for awhile and then went public in 2016. The previous owners have fully sold out now, so the entire shares outstanding are pretty much public float today and there’s no more downward pressure on the stock price from their share sales.

The company also has warrants from the their IPO (effectively long-dated call options) that trade under TWNKW. They trade as half warrants, so need two warrants to form one share and are ITM at $11.50 per one full share and expire in November 2021.

**So what’s the thesis?** We think there’s an opportunity to wring out the short sellers in this name and potentially even further upside from a gamma squeeze if we can get enough call option volume. From a fundamental standpoint, the business is extremely stable (as it was a pretty ideal candidate for an LBO), and trades at a slight discount to its peers.

# Technical Thesis

1. **High short interest = squeeze opportunity** – Roughly 15% short interest today, higher than AMC which is last reported at 10-15% (see end of post for reference) and BB at 5-10%. This seems low in comparison to GME, but again this company has no structural problems that we’re aware of (can’t really say the same for movie theaters or mall-based retailers right now) and has actually been performing pretty well. Also, anything above 20% short interest is considered pretty high in the normal world. This level of short interest on a solid business smells like opportunity to squeeze out a couple of greedy hedge funds.
2. **Limited liquidity and trading volume will make it difficult for shorts to cover** – Average 3-month daily trading volume of 1.4mm shares (roughly 1% of the float). It would take about *13+ DAYS* for the shorts to fully cover if they were to buy up all the average daily trading volume. Current $2bn market cap is also in the perfect sweet spot for the retail pool of capital. If you’re looking for a bit of diversification, this is the name.
3. **The potential for a Gamma squeeze is all further upside** – There’s actually been option activity picking up on this company. ***On Friday, Nasdaq reported that call options for 2.6mm of underlying shares traded hands on TWNK. This is with limited mention of TWNK online thus far (based on my keyword search through reddit)****.* See [this report](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-friday-option-activity%3A-twnk-wdc-nvcr-2021-01-29). Most of those options were sold OTM at the $17.50 strike price. Things are moving quick here and we might not be the only ones that have sniffed out this opportunity. In order to create the biggest upside, buying the highest strike call option is ideal. As the price moves closer to ITM on those options, the market makers will have to buy more shares to hedge. The IV is still really low on this name.

# Fundamental Thesis

1. **Snacking continues to be king.** Large market, resilient, growing. 95% of U.S. adults snack daily, and the average American snacks 3x-5x per day. The snacking category generates \~$150bn in annual sales and is expected to continue growing mid-single-digits driven by the need for convenience as consumers (at least pre-COVID-19) are busier than ever. Lots of room for multiple winners in the industry, of which I think Hostess will continue to be one.
2. **Strong organic growth story**. Organic sales have grown \~6% per year on average over the last number of years. Hostess Brands is growing – and likely gaining share.
3. **Strong brand value and nostalgia factor with millennials.** Some of you might be old enough to remember this but during 2012, when the company filed for bankruptcy (due to the heavy debt burden from its buyout), consumers freaked out that the company would discontinue production of their beloved Twinkies, triggering a mad scramble to buy up all available supply of Twinkies. ***At the peak Twinkies sold on Ebay for $22,000 (see article*** [***here***](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/on-ebay-the-starting-bid-for-a-single-twinkie-is-now-5-000/265346/)***).***
4. **The acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 rides the healthy snack trend.** Voortman sells crème wafers and sugar free cookies (new product categories for Hostess), and markets as having no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup, and no trans-fat (playing the “better-for-you” snack trend). Voortman is one of the fastest growing independent sweet snacking brands of scale in North America, and should be able to accelerate growth by leveraging Hostess’ existing distribution footprint.
5. **COVID-19 re-opening should drive a bounce-back in convenience store traffic, which is the company’s primary sales channel and may also increase demand as consumers become busy again (and thus snack more).** Management plans to keep growing within the convenience store channel, which is a growing end-market and should rebound as the world re-opens. As consumers get back to their busy pre-COVID-19 lives, they may also go back to snacking more out of convenience.

# Potential Risks

1. **Changing consumer preferences, especially to healthy.** The recent acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 allows Hostess to further capitalize on the healthy trend.
2. **Pretty high leverage for a public company.** They have roughly $950mm of net debt, or \~4x leverage on Adj. EBITDA (Adj. EBITDA is a proxy for cash flow). This is pretty high leverage for a public company (but quite low in private equity land). Leverage increased to \~4.5x in the beginning of 2020 after the acquisition of Voortman Cookies (up from \~3.4x before the acquisition), but has steadily declined to \~4x today as Adj. EBITDA has grown. Given their cash flow profile, would not be surprised to see them continue to deleverage.
3. **Customer concentration.** The Company’s largest customer is Walmart, which was \~24% of sales. Top ten customers accounted for \~62% of sales in 2019. Some risk with customer concentration, but Hostess Brands is such a well-known and entrenched brand that I don’t think retail stores will do anything irrational.
4. **Rebound of COVID-19.** Risk that COVID-19 cases rise again, possibly hurting traffic and sales through retail stores, increasing costs, or causing supply chain disruptions. On the flip side, the snack category seems to have held steady from consumers staying at home and snacking more.

# Conclusion

If you’re looking for a little diversification or finding the next oversold stock, look no further. This stacks up as a much better opportunity than AMC or BB given the higher short interest and more stable business fundamentals. Also, we can also potentially create even more upside with a gamma squeeze if we are able to buy more call options at the high strike prices.

***Again, this is not intended to distract from other holdings you may have. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade (and hopefully does not require much capital). Bringing this to your attention now before it starts to trade away from us or before the hedge funds exit their shorts.

50m minus ""9m from Ryan RC Ventures"" minus ""15-20m from this reddit group"" = 21m-26m

Lets say SI is 28m on Sunday. Add SI from today and you will get 31m of SI.

Now SI to realistic float ratio = 125-150% - VERY VERY HIGH!!!

KEY IS TO HOLDDDDDDDDD !!! DIAMOND HANDS!!!!

What everyone misses is that ENTIRE FLOAT IS NOT UP FOR GRAB, which is different from other stocks. You have RC Venture with 9m shares and out of 8 million diehards of Reddit wallstreetbets/gme groups, it’s easy to assume we have 15-20m shares among us in diamond hands! So realistic float of 21-26m is much more important than the textbook float of 50m. So that makes 31m of SI very high stacked against worst case realistic float of 26m!! Even if few people drop out (too bad they will miss huge gains potentials) then we are looking at 100% ratio at a minimum. Now imagine Ryan Cohen announces major news for GameStop like raising stake or huge tie up and stock jumps organically? Shorts are scared of that surprise. Porsche did exactly that with Volkswagen. Once short ladder attacks are over, low hanging fruits are grabbed up from paper hands and interest starts pounding on these HFs, the stock will jump exponentially!! 

Must read:
Feb01 COB article from a reputed writer on SeekingAlpha:

“The GME momentum higher will probably continue for some more days, even weeks. Some of the short-selling hedge funds will disappear - bankrupted or bought out (likely pennies on the dollar). When that happens, the GME rally/momentum will stop”

Lakeland Industries. 10-15% short interest & constantly abused by wannabe hedge funds. 

It's a small cap manufacturer of protective equipment and accessories for the industrial and public protective clothing market worldwide. The company has a robust balance sheet, and current trades at a \~4x expected fiscal year ended 2021 EBITDA on a fully diluted basis (which is a complete joke).  The valuation is dumb for two reasons: 1) a general misunderstanding by the market that this is purely a COVID-19 play; 2) the company has traditionally been known as sleepy and a poor allocator of capital, which, contrary to its valuation, is no longer the case. 

Driven by a new management team and a newly implemented ERP system, the company’s recent financial performance has been outstanding since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Q3 revenues for the fiscal year 2021 came in at $41.5M, representing growth of 18% from Q3, and 50% from the prior year’s Q3 of fiscal 2020. Increased demand for its products, and significant improvements in gross margins, Lakeland has enabled Lakeland to generate cash from operations of $34.5 million over the last twelve months. As a result of this success, the company’s balance sheet now features a total cash balance of $40.2 million, and no debt. Lakeland is one of the few producers of protective equipment to own its manufacturing facilities, which has enabled it to service customers globally far quicker than its larger competitors, who rely on contractors. An effective supply chain is an important differentiator in today’s environment. 

The capital structure is clean. Lakeland only has one class of shares, the total share count is fairly low, and directors and shareholders own roughly 2.9% of the company. Stock options outstanding also are very low (only about 24,900 as at October 31, 2020). The company does repurchase shares from time to time, but has not done so during the current fiscal year. 

Judging by the low trading multiples, the market has clearly branded this exclusively as a COVID-19 PPE stock. This appears to be far from the truth. Lakeland estimates that approximately 35% of its revenue is driven by COVID-19 PPE requirements, and the remainder of its revenue is related to product segments not related to the pandemic. Lakeland is therefore uniquely positioned to benefit not only from the newly emerging industrial cleaning industry, but also from the economic recovery. Management has been mindful to not pivot its core business entirely from protective equipment for various industries (O&G, fire safety, chemical) to servicing COVID-19 demand, so that it can continue to excel as the pandemic subsides. 

The big question for investors right now is what will Lakeland do with its glut of cash? The current management team is demonstrating a strong understanding of its cost structure, driven by its recent implementation of an ERP system.  Low margin SKUs have been culled, which has led to improved gross margins. The facilities in Vietnam and India are being expanded to meet the increased, and sustainable, demand in developing markets. On an annualized basis for the current fiscal year, Lakeland is currently clipping at a ROIC of 30%. Therefore I’m a proponent for reinvestment, and expect management to pursue scaling this business up. Complemented by a renewed societal focus on protective equipment, and buoyed by continuous PP&E stockpiling which is likely to sustain well into 2022, Lakeland is in a prime position to scale up its success and accelerate its already impressive growth trajectory. 

**Catalyst**

· Significant re-rate by the market once Lakeland sustains its impressive results as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. A targeted EV/EBITDA multiple of \~13.0x is implied by comparable companies. That implies a TARGET PRICE OF $57, which will be easy to achieve and is backed by results.

I suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions

TLDR; **Melvin and gang hasn't covered shit. They've been illegally ""closing out"" their short positions and if we hold they will 100% get fucked. There is far more nefarious shit at play.**

So this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME. This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above ~120% short interest still. I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close >50% of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week. This got me digging around to figure out what's up.

I started by looking into GME failed to delivers (i.e. short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock) for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan, GME had ~1.2 MILLION failed to delivers. This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying.

What was interesting though, is that of that ~1.2million, ~700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period. I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months. It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road.

Having spent some time looking at the pattern, it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in, then a small chunk of coverage, then another large amount, and so on. To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article: https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf

In it, a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME:

""Assuming that XYZ (e.g. GME) is a hard to borrow security (e.g. apes holding strong), and that Trader A (Melvin), or its broker-dealer, is unable (apes again) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer’s close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as “reset transactions,” in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm’s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.""

It's almost like a play by play of what we've seen (in combination with the ladder attacks). My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th.

I 100% think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud. In fact, I would bet all my money on it - oh wait, I did 96 GME @ 290.

I am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail.

Not a financial adviser, I eat paint chips for dinner


One paragraph for the lazy or idiotic from the link: (credit to u/bcRIPster)

“I don’t mean the bet WSB played… that Marvin had 140% of the FLOAT. I mean that Vanguard, Fidelity and BlackRock have sold more than the TOTAL SHARES that EXIST.

That's a completely different problem and it's punishable by jail time. Not a joke. It's basically counterfeiting stock shares, although that's not the terminology used. If this is true, who knows how many other times they’ve done this. Or maybe it's not true, and they just really like the stock??? If BlackRock started buying five days ago, and the longest they can likely do this is 21 days, then the doomsday clock doesn’t run out until at least February 17th. If Wall Street can get WSB to sell before then, then they won’t get caught and won’t go to jail. But if they don’t…. well, this will make Enron look like chump change.

If enough people hold until the end of February, and this is truly the situation, then there is a chance that major parts of Wall Street are going to IMPLODE.

---------- The Conclusion ----------

Apes need diamond hands until the end of February in order to get the SEC involved, most likely somewhere between Feb 17th - 19th. Whether or not this will happen is anybody's guess, but if it does all heck may break loose!”



My opinion? This, along with the fact that a shit ton of calls expiring March 19th that we’re just bought (see the front page of WSB) means that this may not end for a few weeks, maybe even longer. The only way hedge funds will lose is if the shares are HELD.

Are we going to do this???? Or are we going to paper hand out? If we’re commuting to this shit let’s do it!!!! If you’re gonna paper hand eventually we don’t want you, get out. It just makes it worse the later you paper hand. Someone else who will diamond hand those shares should have the chance to buy them and appreciate them for what they are.

TLDR:
If these guys are right about there theory about what is going down behind the scenes, you may have to hold up until end of February or even longer. But this shit is happening. ALSO dont watch the ticker every day or you will get burnt out. This is REALLY important. Take a walk, workout, read, watch TV, spend some time with family; take some breaks from staring at the ticker. It may not do much other than be manipulated lower, rise slightly, and be stable in the near term. But this will squeeze the day that shorts are legally forced to cover due to the shit they pulled

Ok, so I can barely read as much as the next shit throwing monkey that roams these autistic lands and with that being said I was able to do a significant amount of DD in the form of reading every single WSB post in the past few weeks since this GME stuff really started to take off. So I am basically the smartest helmet. 

MY QUESTION : If over 100% of the GME shares where shorted by the Hedge Funds, and shorted shares being that they are borrowed and never actually paid for (yet) and then we have a bunch of retail investors that flood the market and pay cash for the GME shares so that we own the shares. This being the case, does that mean that every single retail investor has the opportunity to tell the Hedge Fund what price to pay for their share at? I mean if the Hedge Funds told the SEC that they own over 100% of the GME shares when retail investors actually own their shares. Then why are we not all of us setting our sell limit to 100k and no less. Forcing the Hedge Funds to pay that share price for every single GME share for every single investor that is selling.  

Like if I go on my account right now and set my sell limit to 100k right now, will the hedge fund eventually be absolutely 100% forced to pay that price no matter what? Like, they NEED my shares. The people who bought .5 shares of GME they don't just WANT  your half a share, they are in desperate NEED for that .5 share because they lied when they told the SEC how many shares they have so you could sell that half a share for 50k if you wanted to.

I know people have been saying that retail investors have the power right now. And is this how? Because we can set the price. Like an actual fixed price that they 100% have to pay no matter what.

AMC is a solid sell at these prices, and I'll cover just some of the reasons.

\- Hedgies dumped millions of NEW shares onto market last week, in exchange for the debt of AMC they held:

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake/silver-lake-cashes-out-on-amc-for-713-million-after-reddit-fueled-rally-idUSKBN29Z00E](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake/silver-lake-cashes-out-on-amc-for-713-million-after-reddit-fueled-rally-idUSKBN29Z00E)

And they are thinking of dumping even more NEW shares, CRUSHING any hopes of a short squeeze, just last week **more than 44m shares were sold by Silver Lake, this is the same amount as THE ENTIRE NUMBER OF SHARES SOLD SHORT according to Ortex data as of 15th of Jan ( the most recent release) :**

[https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-considers-selling-more-stock-134513894.html](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-considers-selling-more-stock-134513894.html)

&#x200B;

And **shareholders have been diluted in their positions by around 75%!** :

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amc-entertainment-stock-now-a-sell-at-mkm-as-price-target-drops-to-1-11612196602](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amc-entertainment-stock-now-a-sell-at-mkm-as-price-target-drops-to-1-11612196602)

And more than **100m shares have/will/are in the process of being issued**, they a issuing shares like the FED are printing money:

[https://www.thestreet.com/investing/amc-entertainment-capital-raise](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/amc-entertainment-capital-raise)

&#x200B;

**And most of this occurred AFTER the short interest report for Jan 15, which only showed a ABSOLUTELY pitiful 15.92% Short Interest, and only 1.21 days to cover, and cost to borrow being incredibly low - see the Ortex panel. I'd post a pic here from my account but I can't upload it at the moment. This was never high enough for a squeeze, now with all these new shares on the market or about to hit it you HONESTLY STILL THINK THERE WILL BE A SQUEEZE? STILL?** 

**SILVER has about the same chance now of squeezing as AMC!**

\----------

This is getting beyond a joke. The current price was clearly a result of baseless hype and people assuming it is still going to short squeeze. This is clearly all but a lie at this point. The company will trend back to it's fundamental value of around 2$ -$3 ( the broker consensus on IB) very quickly, as soon as people realize it's not going to squeeze anymore. This was what the price targets were when the company was talking about the real possibility of bankruptcy only about two weeks ago ( see SEC filings ). They won't go bankrupt now, at least in the near term, because they issued a shit ton of shares during the short mania, but this still leaves around 5.1 Billion in debt, and a company losing more than 100 million a month thanks to Covid.

If you are looking for a afterparty to join after GME, AMC definitely isn't it.

\---------

**TLDR:**

**Don't suck others into this failing short squeeze just because got sucked in by the hypetrain and want to sell the stock you bought at 17-20$ to some other poor bastard who knows even less than you do about short squeezes.**

Poistions:

Put spreads, such as  OTM bearish butterflys, verticals, and diagonals. Basically however I can get some negative deltas on this thing without paying to much in IV.

It made me realize that what these dudes have done was to force the clearing houses to hedge against the contracts by BUYING 100 SHARES FOR EACH CONTRACT. I know 800 strike and the timeline is probably expensive. But if the dumbo hedgies try to ""scare"" us off with artificially low prices, we can respond by buying options contracts way out of the money, which inadvertently is probably not way out of the money at all. This could start a gamma squeeze and we can probably generate the catalyst we need to push back against the hedge funds. Buying shares is a grind, and buying 100 of them at $325 is waaaaay more expensive than buying a single call option contract.

QNX is generally regarded among engineers as the most advanced, stable and secure operating system in the world. As such it is trusted by the likes of NASA for mission critical operations, large nuclear power stations, factories, high-speed train control systems, and an endless array of embedded systems that require 0% downtime. QNX has earned its reputation and many in the computer industry believe that if QNX had chosen to compete with Microsoft and Apple and pursue a consumer sales route rather than an enterprise route, the world of computing would be generations ahead of where it is now. 

So what makes it so great? QNX is built on a micro-kernel, which means that the core component of the OS (the kernel) only contains the bare minimum amount of code that can provide the mechanisms required to run an operating system. The remaining functions in a typical kernel (Monolithic OS) such as the filesystem, device drivers, application IPC, etc. are instead run outside of the kernel in the user space. Essentially what this means is that the kernel is the only software executing at the most privileged hardware level and is therefore infinitely more secure and stable. Bad drivers, software or executions can’t bring it down.

Micro-kernels also allow for RTOS, which simply means an operating system with guaranteed consistency for how long it takes to accept and complete a task. For a real-life scenario, think about the ABS brakes on a car – they require mission critical specifications to occur in real-time or someone can die, so the system running them has to be able to guarantee the delivery, receipt and execution of messages in X amount of time or it does not qualify at RT.

The benefits of this architecture are too numerous to get into here, but one of the main benefit to RIM is its ability to execute multiple platform runtimes at the same time with high efficiency – this is why you can write an application in C/C++, Adobe AIR, Webworks HTML5, and Java and have them all run natively on BlackBerry 10. The benefit to developers and consumers here cannot be understated. Basically ANYONE with any amount of programming experience can make an app, from high-level web based UI’s to low-level 3D games.

QNX takes their design one step further by also offering POSIX support, which is a family of IEEE standards that helps maintain OS and software compatibility. Being a full POSIX system, and not partly POSIX, ensures it’s a lot easier to develop software for the QNX platform."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|['BB', 'QNX']|[]|['QNX', 'NASA', 'QNX', 'QNX', 'QNX', 'OS', 'IPC', 'RTOS', 'ABS', 'X', 'RT', 'RIM', 'AIR', 'NYONE', 'D', 'QNX', 'POSIX', 'IEEE', 'OS', 'POSIX', 'POSIX', 'QNX']|['RT', 'AIR']

VW short interest was 12.8% at the most. THERE IS STILL 120% SHORT INTEREST IN GME. They are still not buying. They are doing everything they can to manipulate and induce panic selling, so they can buy in to cover shorts as low as possible. THE FRENZY OF BUYING THAT IS COVERING SHORTS STILL HAS NOT HAPPENED. Hold strong and buy the dip. They are trying to ride out this movement and squash it with disinformation. Also, this is not financial advice, I am dumber than a second coat of paint. I just really like the stock.

Was mostly trying to point out the large dip JUST before massive squeeze. Apologies because I realize the chart I pasted kind of sucks, but google it for yourself because fuck you. Hopefully you realize that short positions eventually have to buy back the shares they borrowed. That is the real squeeze. I know that VW and GME are not the same situation, because I recognize GME is much more volatile and much more potential to squeeze higher. Lower float, higher short interest, legion of millions of retards, etc.

1. They don’t give a fuck about the small guy and their losses. Loss porn is literally a thing and that only proves that they aren’t protecting us, but their own positions. The only reason to protect yourself is if you are about to get hurt.

If someone is a about to punch you in the face but they are 2 blocks away you don’t do shit. If they are within striking distance you do everything you can to protect yourself.

2. The reputational costs of doing this are astronomical, take RH for example who possibly fucked their IPO. The cost/benefit of this means that these costs of removing shares is lower than the cost of doing nothing and getting smashed by us.

3. I could only think of two reasons before my autism kicked in and I started licking a pole.

# Short sellers are not just cheating at the game, they're scaring the referees into submission.

What we know:

1. Volume was incredibly low today, thanks to restrictions on platforms popular with retail investors (and good monkes holding).
2. Despite low volume, we saw ridiculous price drops as firms traded cash to ladder the price down.
3. Even with conservative/favorable estimates on short interest, HFs/MMs/Brokerages are still extremely exposed because...
4. There is a massive synthetic shares problem with no real way out, except continuously kicking the can down the road. As beautifully put by /u/forzan, [""their cure is a poison they can't stop taking.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lanf94/gme_is_a_time_bomb_and_its_highlighting_a_severe/)

**This all points to textbook** [**Brinkmanship**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brinkmanship)**, or a form of** [**Madman Theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madman_theory)**.**

GME shorts have taken the financial system hostage, strapped it into the back seat, and are driving full-speed-ahead at retail investors in a massive game of chicken.  From what we've seen, hedgies are willfully doubling down on a terrible bet, to the point that it threatens to crash the market.

They know they lost the match, so their only option is to work the referees. My guess is that they're trying to fill the powder keg even more, and make the potential fallout so destructive, the SEC has no choice to step in and halt trading. Whatever fines or punishments are levied can't possibly be as bad as the alternative, which is an extinction event for multiple firms (HFs and brokerages).

# So how can the little  🐒 respond?

***You've got to convince them you're more irrational than they are.*** This shouldn't be difficult for this group of shit-throwing apes.

From the Wikipedia article on brinkmanship:

>*For brinkmanship to be effective, the sides continuously escalate their threats and actions. However, a threat is ineffective unless credible—at some point, an aggressive party may have to prove its commitment to action.*

The hedge funds have already begun demonstrating the ""credibility"" of their threat as early as Wednesday last week. They're trying very hard to give the appearance that they are prepared to nuke everything if the refs don't cancel the match.

To win, retail investors have to show they're completely prepared to hold to $0.

You might think that you would never FOMO into a stock or you might be wondering if this applies to you. Ask yourself these questions to find out if you need the checklist. 

- Have you ever thought of buying some super hyped shares at ATH?

- Have you thought about joining ‘the team’ in the squeeze on stockthatshallnotbenamed? (Ps. there are no teams in retail investing it’s every man for himself)

- Do you use WallStreetBets? 

If you answered yes to any of the precursor questions below then you are in danger of a FOMO trade and need this checklist. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HOW NOT TO FOMO CHECKLIST 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Ask yourself why you want to buy the stock. Are you jealous of others gains? Do you want to be part of that weeks big thing? If yes to either then do not buy. Jealous trading is bad trading. 

2. Warren Buffet said “be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.” Ask yourself if people are being greedy with the stock you want to buy, do not buy if they are. 

3. Ask yourself “am I being a sheep?” Sheep do not make money on the stock market, they don’t even understand the stock market, they are sheep. Don’t be a sheep. 

4. Where did you see the stock? If it was on the news don’t buy it. If it’s trending on one of the subreddits then it’s probably too late. 

5. Is it often appearing on the subreddit and being regularly pushed by the same small crowd? Watch out cause without proof they are probably bag holders hoping to pass the bag to you. 

6. Can you explain to somebody what the company does and why it is a good idea to buy it? If not then you shouldn’t buy it yourself. 

7. Is the market mostly red or mostly green that week? Sell on green weeks and buy on red weeks. It might feel like the other way around at the time but that’s emotional trading. 
8. Is it a meme stock? If yes then be an early adopter or don’t adopt at all. 

9. Have you got spare capital? If money is no issue to you or if you are making a small punt that won’t harm your finances then go ahead. If you are making a big, late move into a meme stock then you’ll be seeing red. 

10. Does it have emojis in the DD’s? If yes then disregard all previous steps and bet your house on it."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|['A', 'FOMO']|[]|['FOMO', 'ATH', 'FOMO', 'HOW', 'NOT', 'TO', 'FOMO', 'KLIST', 'I']|[]

Finally, the little guy has gained awareness and has a chance to expose and potentially beat them at their own game. As a full time retail trader focusing in the metal markets I am familiar with the “supply issues” and the suppression of price of silver. The idea that if the demand for physical silver rose and caused a scarcity and therefore a forced demand of deliverables could in turn seriously crush the larger institutions that are net short is not new to me. I have been giving a lot of thought to the idea that many degens in this and other forums have expressed in attempting to squeeze the gay bears through heavy call flow on SLV and AG. I was incredulous to begin with as we all know how easily the hedgies can change the game on us smaller fish.

In a Eureka moment it dawned on me that instead of trying to take down the entirety of the Silver Shorters, there could be more of an affect if you concentrated on one specific area. This is where SLV comes into play......stay tuned to the end as the plot thickens with even more manipulation at foot.

By now we have all heard of call buying gamma effects. Well, in SLV we have many key components that could cause the same effect that we saw in GME. The list is as follows:

* $25 dominant options strike
* The 25 strike relates to an area where major hedging by dealers needs to take place in order for them to  
stay solvent in their SLV positions.
* Hedge wall, where dealers are likely to change the way that they hedge, is currently sitting at $25
* The key gamma strike, where most of the open interest that is related to gamma, is tied to $25
* This indicates that at the $25 is where most of the dealer hedging needs to kick in.
* The key delta strike, where most of the ITM strikes are, is....you guessed it $25
* On top of these greeks, the top PUT OI and top CALL OI are at, yet again $25

We want to see the key gamma strike or hedge wall shift up high as this implies that dealers are buying at higher prices. Dealers are carrying a negative net gamma which means that they will get hurt as price moves up which causes them to buy more shares to keep up with their hedges. We currently have a much higher call volume than put volume as the 8/19/2021 EXP is 4.1 mil calls to 770k puts.

  
If SLV breaks under $25 you will see dealers begin to unwind there positions causing in influx of VOL. Moving forward (above $25) VOL is relatively low. This is due to the volume being distributed over a wide range of strikes. If there were to be a concentration of call buying at the $25 this will in turn increase the VOL above the $25 level.

  
If you want to see a Squeeze type move, we need to see an addition of call options at strikes >25 which would shift the momentum higher.

  
Here is where the plot thickens: As I was writing this I went to look at the AUG chain for SLV and noticed that it has disappeared across all platforms that I use. DO YOU THINK THAT THEY ARE FINALLY SCARED!!! Time will tell. The same effect could be accomplished by going one month out to the SEPT contracts or by buying shorter dated contracts and continuing to roll them until the dealers have drowned in that one position.

As with every disclaimer. This is not financial advice, and I wrote this as a research paper. Trade at your own risk and do your own research. Have fun and enjoy those tendies. 

My position: nothing currently, watching 25 carefully as I said."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082633.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'SLV', 'AG', 'I', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'GME', 'SLV', 'ITM', 'PUT', 'OI', 'CALL', 'OI', 'EXP', 'SLV', 'VOL', 'VOL', 'VOL', 'I', 'I', 'AUG', 'SLV', 'I', 'DO', 'YOU', 'THINK', 'THAT', 'THEY', 'ARE', 'NALLY', 'CARED', 'SEPT', 'I', 'I']|['GME']

I am just sharing what I have read all day today instead of working my day job. Please do your own research to confirm what I am going to say below.

Hey traders,

As Palantir's earnings is coming around the corner (estimated 2/11), their lock-up expiration will also come along at third trading session day after the ER, so estimated to be 2/14. And people who have been watching PLTR should be aware that the lock-up exp may be a huge negative catalyst as several ANALysts have been talking shit on the stock for potential unloading of 80% shares, crashing the stock price.

As a techie who has deep conviction in the company and its tech (browse the sub for plenty of DDs on company's outlook), I was confused when I saw [webull's information on the stock's free float at 1.2b vs. shares outstading at 1.7b](https://imgur.com/a/o5YePOB). Does this mean the lock-up expiration will free up only >400m shares (if yes, BULLISH)? It got confusing so I decided to look into the s-1 filing specifically for the shares structure and forth.

**NOTE**: This is my first time diving deep into a stock like this so **PLEASE** correct me if any part of this incorrect or too biased. I have tried my best to not skip any unclear terminology I faced along the way but in the end, I am not an analyst so I have limited knowledge.

&#x200B;

# [S-1 filing](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/896d430c-206d-49a4-9ffb-b83d9bf6f758.pdf)

As of **September 1st, 2020**, this was the total number of shares:

https://preview.redd.it/wq5sqbv3t0f61.png?width=1133&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5ff5a477cb1567b43f9393cdff2aa712f734820

Ignoring/Including small figure RSUs, growth units, and exercisable options:

On first trading day back in September:

* 383,609,647 fully-diluted shares (including stock options) was available to trade
* Registered additional 257,135,415 shares to be available to trade
* Due to Investors’ Rights Agreement, they ""expected"" up to 656,018,583 shares registered additionally to be available to trade
* Total: Up to 1,296,763,645 fully-diluted shares (which seems accurate according to 1.2b free float)

On lock-up expiration day (estimated 2/14):

* 1,863,150,291 fully-diluted shares will be available to trade
   * From what I understand, registering shares allow them to be available to trade so we subtract 257,135,415 and 656,018,583 shares
   * Adjusted: 949,996,293 fully-diluted shares
* Result: Total of 2,246,759,938 fully-diluted shares.
   * The figure above shows 2,173,481,929 fully-diluted shares. The math lines up considering additional RSUs, options could have been issued since September.
* So the lock-up expiration doesn't free up **80%** of outstanding, but instead **42%**.

* TOTAL: **50,318,461** shares

Source: [nasdaq insider activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/pltr/insider-activity)

None of the large shareholders/VCs/institutions sold! Also notice how bitch Soros is not even in the list! 🤣

The insider selling can be said to be pretty high in normal circumstances. But this can be explained in that since PLTR was a direct listing, they had to offload some shares, as well as register a lot of shares, so that the stock had liquidity (something Robinhood doesn't have 🤡). Also, not to mention the company has been around since 2003 so this may have been the first time for the big time insiders to cash out. (Note that these arguments can be seen as biased so take it with a grain of salt).

&#x200B;

# What will happen on lockup expiration day?

I think the following will happen:

* 🧻👐 will sell
* Some short sellers will come by for sure
* Insiders will obviously sell some. But it's not going to be anywhere near the impact that 🐻s are fearing.

**Some key rumors:**

* Some insiders are looking to buy up shares - [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kym23z/pltr_folks_listen_in_karp_and_cohen_to_make_188m/)
* Insiders already had chances to liquidate over the years - [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l49dut/pltr_vs_child_rapists_starvation_hurricanes/) (a good DD overall as well from ex-Palantir engineer)

I am personally planning to buy the dip if there is a big one, but I doubt the red will last long and the stock will go up onwards. I will be putting aside cash to buy the dip

&#x200B;

**TLDR; I think lock-up expiration won't mean shit to the stock and I am bullish**

So far, many of you have seen and heard about the ladder attacks that have been happening with GME recently. What if I tell you that ""short interest is going down"" is the result of shorts unwinding their previous ladder attacks?

Let me explain:

Today, I saw something very strange on Webull. I saw shares of GME being traded in L2 data for \~$14, \~20$, and around \~$30. I managed to take a screenshot from one of these sales and in order to make sure that something is very wrong, I made a limit buy order at $30 before it happened again. The order obviously didn't get filled:

&#x200B;

[L2 Time & Sales Data \/ removed my other limit orders](https://preview.redd.it/lmjh2m5bn0f61.png?width=2732&format=png&auto=webp&s=5745279c389cb4101b55f1b9771f776263a2138b)

At first, I thought this might be a glitch, but after thinking about it more, it clicked! I've been following GME for months, the key is within why these prices were chosen ($14, $20, $30)! Folks who've been following GME closely know that GME broke $14 for the first time after the Microsoft deal. Both $20 and $30 were also important breakthroughs for GME's price.

So why are we seeing these prices again today? I have a theory! Short sellers were having ladder attacks back then, but the way they probably did them was the following:

Let's say hedgefund A and hedgefund B are colluding to bring the price down. Since there are no shares available to borrow, A buys 1000 shares and lends them to B. B then shorts those shares but makes sure that A is the one buying them. A lends these shares to B again and B shorts them again. This continues until the price gets down to the desired level. This artificially increases the short interest of GME, but in reality, only 1000 shares have been changing hands. If you look carefully, you see these shares that are being traded in the above screenshot have slightly different prices.

Here is the thing: these short-sellers are probably unwinding the previous ladder attacks now to reduce the artificial short interest they have previously created! The fact that there are not many shares to borrow even though short interest ""in theory"" seems to be going down also proves this! I'm baffled by how dumb these short sellers are to actually use the prices that they used to create those ladder attacks! They are not even trying to hide their tracks at this point!

Now you might ask ""what if all of the short interest is artificial?"", the answer is an obvious no! Why do you ask? because if they didn't have massive short positions, they wouldn't have to do these ladder attacks, to begin with!

How do I know (or rather guess) that the actual short interest hasn't gone down by a lot? 2 reasons:

1. The stock is still hard to borrow in almost all brokerages (AFAIK)
2. The following screenshot shows that there are only %15.9 of all the outstanding shares have been bought at a higher price than today's closing price, which would be around  11.09m shares:

[Position Cost Distribution](https://preview.redd.it/n0okmsbug0f61.jpg?width=1493&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c8638cfede5177ba9e87107aa1f93dd8e20494c)

As you know, today's closing price was a lower price than the price of almost all trades that happened today and Friday, which means one thing: There are AT MOST 11.09m shares left in the float and all that is happening is that they are just changing hands! So the short interest AT MOST has gone down by (0.159\*69.75m=) 11.09m in the past two days (unless the folks who have lent these shares out have sold them immediately after they received them, which seems unlikely to me since I haven't seen any SEC filings from institutions)!

What I do not know is this: do these short-sellers report these artificial short interests in their official report of ""short selling"" or not! My guess is that they don't, because:

1. They are probably scared of getting caught!

2. Another reason why I think these artificial short sales are not included in the official short interest numbers is that short interest estimates for GME has always been off and this can explain why this has been the case (when they are using these type of ladder attack, the estimates are probably higher than reality, and when they are unwinding them the estimates are probably lower).

3. I think it is also very likely that they are unwinding these positions now to cover their tracks!

Also, note that shorts don't have to ""borrow and sell"" to each other to create a ladder, they can just ""buy and sell"" from each other. However, I think they've done this to intentionally mess with the short interest estimates!

Based on this evidence, I believe that the squeeze has not squoze! This also suggests that short-sellers have been committing crimes for a while now in my opinion since this type of collusion is obviously illegal!

**Disclaimer: I'm not a financial adviser and this is not financial advice. This is for entertainment purposes only and purely speculative even though it might look otherwise! I've been long GME and have a lot of GME shares.**

Hopefully, SEC will take a close look at what these short-sellers are doing, but given that it seems like this has been going on for a while, I doubt that anyone will do anything about this!"|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['THIS', 'IS', 'RTANT', 'LEASE', 'T', 'EMOVE', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'GME', 'I', 'AT', 'MOST', 'AT', 'MOST', 'I', 'SEC', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'SEC', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

This happened all day

I also learned spikes in ladder attacks seem to be happening daily, around 10-1130am est.. Which is exactly when the UK market begins to close.
This way they can attack the ending of that market while at the same time affecting ours.

The good news is there was no volume to support actual trading or mass selling.

Alright everyone listen up,

So after reading a [good GME DD post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I did some 'research' and found [a tweet](https://twitter.com/minigirraffe/status/1356322532270497793?s=19) about using [Finra](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) data to see Daily Short Volume reported.

Long story short I figured out a way to view the data nicely and make a plot and spoiler alter: Daily Short volume today (2/1/21) was **54.46% (Meaning:**  **54% of** [**$GME**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&amp;src=cashtag_click) **sales on 2/1 were shorts. )**

Don't believe me?? well I have a picture: [https://github.com/undefined-vars/PyFinra/blob/main/gme\_short\_interest\_percent.png](https://github.com/undefined-vars/PyFinra/blob/main/gme_short_interest_percent.png)

(You can also double check the [file here](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210201.txt), Find GME and take Short Vol/ Total Vol).

I have no clue what I'm doing, but if I understand [this](http://regsho.finra.org/DailyShortSaleVolumeFileLayout.pdf) I \*think\* this number doesn't track short volume across all exchanges (so it maybe off), but it can be used as an indicator.

&amp;#x200B;

If someone understands what this data means better, feel free to comment and I can update this. Also please for love of god, don't take any of this as financial advice. I am but a humble reddit citzen who likes the stock.

Link to GitHub repo with code to generate the plots:[Github Repo](https://github.com/undefined-vars/PyFinra)

(Also please no pass judgement on the state of my code, I just threw this together really quickly.)

Edit: I think this file has Daily Short Interest, not total. I also don't know what this means in terms of the squeeze.  


Edit 2: I am also not posting this to try and discourage anyone (I myself am still holding \~100 GME).   
Like I said, not all shorts are reported, but I saw comments and [a tweet](https://twitter.com/minigirraffe/status/1356444468728201219?s=20) talking about this data, so I thought it would be useful if folks could view it easily (rather than scrolling through long txt files).

Edit 3: Omg, I meant “Short Volume” not “Short Interest”. These numbers reflect the number of shorts taken out today not the amount of shorts closed. [A better explanation](https://twitter.com/minigirraffe/status/1356461817384566785?s=21) I’ll update the code tomorrow to make that more clear that it is volume not interest."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|['GME']|['GME']|['I', 'GME', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'A']|['GME', 'GME']

To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1) Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.

2) The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.

3) The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY
    
    # Reads data
    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = value_of_fails
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, val_of_fails in sorted_stocks:
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = val_of_fails / volume
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

Now, I am as much a noob as most of us here, but I decided to go and try to educate myself on what has been going on with GME, to see if there was any chance of the price reversing and going back up. 

I’ve been seeing quite a few folk post about how the trading volume is low, but I never really understood what that means, so a quick Google search lead me to this:  https://finance.zacks.com/volume-mean-trading-stocks-2570.html

It’s making me believe that it’s just the HF’s forcing the price down and that there could still be a price reversal later on. How much later? I have no idea, but I believe that there is potential one coming. 

I also could be completely wrong and am just being an eternal optimist, but until I’m proven otherwise I am going to keep holding!

Today (2/1) didn't go as many expected.

Some expected things to get uglier for obvious reasons. Last week was bad but at the end of it it seemed as an overwhelming success for everyone who is rooting for GME.

Tendies were expected today... didnt happen.

So what did happened? My monkey brain was trying to comprehend the events and occurrences.

One thing that was noted by fellow monkey brain was how chunks of 100 shares have been traded back and forth in rapid succession.  
People soon attributed this to the short sellers running a ladder attack to drive the price down to bring retail investors to sell their shares so shorties can gobble them up and cover.

This tactic had been used last week too so it came to no surprise.

Now apparently news media is reporting that shorts have been covered from a 120 something% down to 39%. How is that even possible when GME ended so strong last week.

Naturally there should follow a huge price spike if that was the case.

My monkey brain keeps thinking back to those chunks of 100 shares traded. I watched it last week and i did today.

Now things seemed to get really heated last Thursday 01/28, some say the squeeze was about to happen that day and that's when the ladder attack hit. Thats when market manipulation was so obvious it was in EVERYONES face. Restricting sales of shares getting the media involved and so on and so forth

In chunks of 100,

One contract of a call or put is for the right but not the obligation to exercise 100 shares.

Ok fine...So... what does that mean.... monkey brain tired no understand big numbers.

Some have noticed that the fail to deliver securities data shows a significant amount of GME stock not being able to cover, however the data is not up to date. We are lagging behind by a little

Going back to the trade restrictions for GME, many platforms have limited the purchase of GME stock

Over the last couple of days i have been reading one broker being mentioned over and over....  
Who is that ? Fidelity it just so happens that fidelity is one of the major stock holders of GME is that coincidence ? There are others but there is no need to go into detail.

After RobbinHood placed the restriction the price action went down but the shorties have been still trading, how? Where are they getting their shares from?

Are there even shares left ? THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION

Its a mess and to make a long story short i believe but do not know for certain that the short ladder attack is actually a form to cover shorties shorts temporarily just like writing checks back and forth to banks.

I am sorry guys i tried my best here... a lot has happened today and the last 7 days.  
To make it clear i am a retard using his limited brain cells which are decaying rapidly every hour to make some sense of this myself. In no form or way should this affect your decision in buying or selling GME stock. I dont know what i am talking about.

I love the different forms of DD we had in the past couple of weeks. Most of them were very technical and I personally found a more and more increasing interest in the people we love to hate. 

I spend the past couple of hours trying to understand what happened in a time where most of us were busy getting to the new level cap of Lich King whilst boomers managed to fuck up the economy. Yes. I’m talking about 2008.

You see, Melvin Capitals story begins under the wings of Steve Cohens S.A.C. Capital. US Attorney Preet Bharara described them as following in 2013: 

*  “culture of corporate corruption”
*  “institutional indifference to unlawful conduct \[that\] resulted in insider trading that was substantial, pervasive, and on a scale without known precedent in the hedge-fund industry.”
*  “a veritable magnet of market cheaters”

If that isn't off to a great start, right? To understand the story I'm about to tell you, here a short summary of how SAC was structured: 

„SAC was structured like a bicycle wheel, with the spokes consisting of about 100 portfolio managers with their own teams of analysts and traders working in competition with the other teams. Camaraderie in SAC’s offices was low. At the center was Cohen, 57, the only connector between the different groups, who would take the best ideas from each and trade on them himself. Aside from losing money, there was nothing Cohen hated more than a portfolio manager who didn’t communicate vigorously and often.“

In 2008 two employees were charged with insider trading. One of them was Mather Martoma who was involved in insider trading with a new Alzheimer drug that first showed positive and then negative results which helped Cohen get out at a perfect time and thus avoided a $275million loss. 

The other was Jon Horvath, he claimed that his asshole boss Steinberg told him get insider information to get better trades or else he would be fired. So he did with DELL and also passed this information to Steinberg. With this insider information he found out DELL was going to have a bad quarter and built up a massive short position only to find out that his even BIGGER ASSHOLE BOSS COHEN was long DELL. And FUCK was he scared of Cohen, the ragey ass went on a rampage whenever he lost money so he mailed Steinberg to tell him about his concerns. Now it get’s interesting. Steinberg told Cohen and Cohen told Steinberg to figure out who the fuck was right. Jon or the person suggesting him this trade – Gabriel fucking Plotkin. You may be asking “Who dis?“ -it's **Melvin Capitals later fucking founder**. After some back and forth Plotkin realized Jon had the better source and confirmed to sell the long position. After its earnings announement DELL dropped 14%. Good job Jon. 

Later that evening, Cohen sent Steinberg a message that read: “Nice job on dell.” Steinberg’s response was, “Thanks… this ole dog can still hunt”.

This happened again. This time Steinberg/Jon being long, Cohen short. Here a chat: 

>AIM:mike72ms \[Steinberg\] dell rpts thrusday  
AIM:cas— \[Cohen\] y …   
AIM:mike72ms **we like it**…weve been good here if u remember  
AIM:cas— call me… it’s a shame-cause I can be helpful to you too but that;s life  
AIM:mike72ms steve I have an analyst that covers this stock… he has industry contacts… im not hiding anything from u

Cohen replied: “I would prefer to talkon phone”.

I decided to leave in the chat because both sound like fucking retards and Cohen like a salty 9 year old. Truely, no different to us

Martoma, the guy with the Alzheimer drug was convicted to a 9 year prison sentence. 

Jon decided to work with prosecutors to try help fuck over Steinberg but in 2015 the case was abandoned. 

In 2011 Plotkin was apparently investigated for trading Weight Watchers based on insider information. An SAC spokesperson denied this claim however by saying „Gabe Plotkin has built a successful career on a commitment to sound fundamental research“

In 2013 SAC pleaded guilty to an insider trading charge, paid an $1.8 billion penalty and changed its name to Point72 Asset Management. Cohen shrunk the companies size and said goodbye to many of his portfolio managers. 

In 2013 the SEC also charged Steve Cohen with a „failing to supervise“ civil charge in regards to Martoma with the goal to give Cohen a lifetime ban from supervising funds that manage outside money. In the end they settled for a two year ban which I guess is almost the same thing. It is rumoured that Plotkin is the mysterious „Portfolio Manager A“ in this charge

In 2014-2015 Cohen took steps to „increase compliance and oversight” at Point72. He hired former F.B.I agents and federal prosecutors. For example Kevin J. O’Connor and Vincent Tortorella. Some saw this as an effort to “gain the confidence of regulators and permit him to again manage money for outside investors.“

In 2014 Gabriel Plotkin, „one of Cohens most successful traders” founded Melvin Capital. Cohen backed him with a small loan of 200 milion dollars.

In a memo sent to more than 800 employees of Point72, Mr. Cohen said that after SAC pleaded guilty, he “vowed that what happened to SAC would never happen to Point72.” The settlement “is not and cannot — be a reason to become complacent,” Mr. Cohen wrote, adding that the firm would become a leader in compliance.

Fact is, the SEC spent almost a decade trying to get dirt on Steve Cohen and failed. Plotkin got a slap on the wrist by being hinted at in the civil charge against Cohen and Steinbergs case was dropped. But hey, the **analyst** who forwarded insider information in 2008 about an alzheimer drug will be freed from prison soon after 9 years in jail. I know insider trading is irrelevant to the current situation however I found the story interesting because it shows by what rules they play and what type of people they are. 

TL;DR: The people behind Melvin and friends are frauds and cheaters. They never played by the rules, never will. SEC knows this but literally can't do anything.

When making trades it is very important to be aware of your emotions. You don't need to become emotionless but moreso conscious of how you react and behave.

Confirmation bias is the tendency to only take on information/opinions that agree with what you believe is (or will be) the case. This emotional bias is highly elevated when the issue is self relevant i.e. if you hold GME and think it will go to the moon, you will read more posts that agree with what you want to be true and toss others to the side, maybe even put them down.

This is bad.

Contrary to popular belief, you can't just manifest a trade or price increase. For example, price goes up and you think it's a good time to sell. You check Reddit and some ape says ""GME will hit 1000 EOD 🚀🚀🚀"" and this makes you hold on a little longer. Pure greed. Other people being allowed to change your opinion on a good trade is poor on your behalf. 

Read what you want to read, trade how you want to trade. Just be aware of how you react and behave with skin in the game.

TL;DR 
If you want GME to go to the moon, you're more than likely only reading comments that say ""GME to the moon"" and everyone else's opinion doesn't matter.

I'm confident I'll be dabbing billionaire tears with my 💎🙌 held handkerchief but I'm also prepared to make an exit strategy come February 9th if the Short Interest ratio has somehow dropped to nothing.

Hey guys, first of all, mods please don't remove this.  
Let's get to it.  
I was here for long, without account lurking and just watching what others 🦧did with their money.  
I saw huge losses, I saw wins, but mainly losses.  
This post is not about advice on how to invest or something, but rather to just give you health advice.  
Let's start:

1. Don't go to your stocks app opening it and closing, hoping something happens. The best way to deal with this is to go out and do stuff to keep your mind off. Why should you do this? Is very unhealthy for the brain to continuously check for new stuff.
2. This is also a great tip. While investing is fun and all, you should also look for factors that will show you that you are slowly going into a depression. Look them up, they are easy to spot, and spotting early can help you.
3. Take time off social media, and walk or exercise if you can. While sitting on your pc and phone is also fun, your body needs to work out so it can work properly. You can make a minigame and if $GME stock goes up by 5% you do 5 pushups etc.

These are some tips I have for you folks. If you need more tips just google them. But don't forget TO HOLD AND WHILE HOLDING TO WORK OUT.  
This community brought a smile to my face. That's why I want to help others.

From fundamentals perspective I think they are doing much better than where their stock price stands. I feel they are undervalued due to some crazy events last year after they merged with their competitor and their own CEO left the organisation.

TL;DR:


- Short interest seemingly falling despite no shares left to borrow (also caused by ticker dropping over 10% in a day which makes it unshortable), probably because it's masked by millions of new synthetic longs created on 28/01


- Synthetic longs likely defensively created by Market Makers who don't pay interest on them for 21 days, to buy time to protect themselves in the event HFs and brokers aren't enough to cover the squeeze;


- Simultaneously, DTCC recognized financial liability in this squeeze could eventually reach clearing houses if the market makers went bankrupt and on the same date increased collateral requirements to purchase GME to 100%;


- MMs can keep this going for a really long time if needed, but that does not mean forever.

Much of what you are told here is wrong.

You can protect yourself to a degree by learning at least the very basics of how markets work. This post will explain to you how prices work on an exchange, and why ""short ladders"" are not even a coherent concept.

**How markets work**

Exchanges have [order books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_book) in which they track interest in a stock. Orders to buy and orders to sell stay in the order book until someone submits an order that matches their price.

The highest price present on buy orders is called the *bid price*.
The lowest price present on sell orders is called the *ask price*.
The difference between the two is called the *spread*.

When you submit an order to the exchange, it trades at the best price it can get. If you're selling, it will sell to the highest bidder even if you said you were willing to sell for zero.

It is possible for companies to trade off-exchange, but when you are looking at the price of a stock on Google or wherever, the price is based on trades that took place on the exchange. For this reason it is common if you're looking at a feed giving you prices in real time to see the price going up and down between two prices for a number of seconds as people sell at bid price and buy at ask price.

**Why short ladders are not possible**

Short ladders are described as two hedge funds selling back and forth to one another at an increasingly lower price.

This makes no sense for the following reasons.

* Off-exchange transactions do not result in ticks. Nobody sees them.
* You cannot target another participant on the exchange to sell to. You have to go through the order book.
* If the order book has $10000 of bids at $100, you cannot drive the price down to $99 except by selling $10000 of stock at $100.

This is a theory made up by someone who has no knowledge of how markets work - if they understood the basics they would at least try to make it believable.

If you google ""short ladder attack"" you will get a bunch of hits on Reddit, [a StackExchange question](https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/135807/closing-shorted-positions-via-short-ladder-attacks) debunking it, and pretty much nothing else of note. If you google ""short attack"" your top two hits are a description from CFO.com of companies releasing a report at the same time they short e.g. alleging financial irregularities, and a piece of frothing madness from SeekingAlpha where some nutter in 2014 makes up a bunch of nonsense involving ""counterfeit shares"".

This is not real."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082633.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['WSB', 'CFO']|['CFO']

From u/Anttte

Before I head to bed I feel the need to leave behind three important pieces of information behind for tomorrow. The first one is this:

https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/interactive-chart

This link provides the information about todays volume. The volume represents the trades that are happening. And today the volume has been really low. This means people are not selling. We have been holding, which should drive the price up.

The second one is this:

https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml

This link provides the information about todays supply/demand considering buy and sell orders (on fidelity). The demand is WAY too high for the supply to meet, which should also drive the price up.

The third is this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8ox3/at_these_levels_its_not_about_the_price_of_the/

Hedge funds are ""fraudulently creating more shares"" and retail are holding. They are using very ugly tactics in order to bring the price down to a number that satisfies them since even $225 is beyond the amount they are prepared to absolutely-have-to-fucking-pay.

Please stay educated. Do not trade emotionally. And lastly get some rest. We do not know when this shitshow will end. But hopefully we will have left a stain of hope in history behind us.

Please feel free to repost this to infinity. It may satisfy alot of people (like myself) who feel extremely anxious after today, and need a pat on the shoulder."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'WAY']|[]

GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next

Hello all,

If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.

**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|['HOLD']|[]|['DD', 'I', 'GME', 'DD', 'RH', 'I', 'WSB', 'ITM', 'A', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'PT', 'A', 'I', 'TSLA']|['GME', 'RH', 'GME', 'TSLA']

It's okay.

First this is not a short squeeze or a this is going to make 100x post. However, $PM is a great value play in my opinion. Obviously not financial advice, I am just a retard. Also $PM may be deemed unmoral. This post is not based on morals, only on financials. I am a non smoker, with no intention of using any nicotine product and would urge every reader to not start using nicotine products, due to their addictiveness.

**TLDR:** PM owns the leading cigarette brand marlboro and have worldwide operation, excluding the USA and China. PM introduced iqos (I quit ordinary smoking) a few years ago. It heats the tobacco and does not burn it. It is supposedly as addictive, but less harmful. The iqos revenues already make up 25% of their revenue and the unit sales are growing at roughly 30%. The market is potentially bigger than cigarettes. $PM is underpriced at a PE of 16.

First, a bit of history. The cigarette business had explosive exponential growth starting in the early 1900s. The growth stopped when the public  got aware of the gigantic negative side effects of smoking (lung cancer). However, the revenues continued to grow, not because of unit sales, but because of price increases. It turns out that cigarettes are highly addictive and it is difficult to give up the habit. Still worldwide unit sales peaked in 2011 at 5700 billion sticks a year. In 2019 they were down to 5100 billion. In the US for example the unit sales peaked in 1997 and are down more than half.

To understand the reason why it is so difficult to quit one needs to understand how nicotine is delivered into the body. By breathing in the nicotine it gets absorbed by your lungs in gets directly into the blood stream. This results in a peak of nicotine. This peak is called nicotine hit. It is the main reason why cigarettes are so addictive. It is also likely that marlboro delivered a product that makes more addictive by changing the ph value of the smoke and therefore increasing the adoption (I think this is true, but I am unsure. Mostly I dont want to get sued by pm). So to make a nicotine product more addictive you have got to increase the speed of absorption. To my knowledge vapes are less addictive, because of a smaller nicotine spike.

$PM engineered iqos in a way that it is able to deliver the same nicotine spike as cigarettes do (they even put pictures of the pharmacokinetic in inverstor information). iqos heats the tobacco, but does not burn it. So instead of burning cigarette, they heat so called heet sticks. iqos has less harmful aerosols in its ""smoke"" since the tobacco  gets heated not burnt. There is no definitive answer to whether iqos is less harmful in the long run, but the indications are here that is less harmful in a significant way. This is underlined by the FDA categorization as a modified risk tobacco product. So to my mind there is a product that is as addictive as cigarettes, but less harmful.

iqos was first introduced in the east asia and australia region and it was a blazing success. The first year with major sales was 2016 with 7billion unit sales. It jumped to 33 billion unit sales in 2017 to 30 billion unit sales in 2019. In Japan (the first market in which iqos was introduced) their unit sales of heets amount to 20% of the entire cigarette market (after something like 5 years). This is a crazy amount of market share. PM itself has a worldwide market share of only 28%. There have already been many product iterations of the heater and I am confident that there are more and better products to come. It should be noted that the overall market in japan cigarette market contracted since the introduction of iqos.

Given the success in Japan PM started the roll out in other countries, currently they are increasing their sales in europe aggressively. I live in central europe and am seeing the increase in iqos users on the streets. So to my mind over the next years PM will be able to grow worldwide heet sales by a multitude. Their aspirational targets are to sell more than 250 billion smoke free sticks by 2025, while they sold 60 billion smoke free sticks in 2019. To my mind this target is achievable and may even be conservative. Further, I believe that they will continue their sales further after the year 2025. Btw. skimming through the iqos subreddit suggest that people how switch to iqos smoke more heets than they previously smoked cigarettes.

The cigarette business has incredible high margins. Based on their net revenue (excluding excise taxes) their operating margin is more than 40% and increasing. This increase is partly because of the increase in revenue of iqos. I think that the pricing power may even increase due to iqos. Since iqos needs a heating device a nespresso like system is created with switching costs. 

So how much should be a company like this be worth. Personally I value it at something like 130$ per share. (trades around 80$). However, when pricing it in comparison to something like $PEP I am shocked that $PM trades around a PE of 17, while $PEP trades at 27. 

Summary: To my mind the earnings are going to grow at a rate of something like 5% per year for the foreseeable future. The iqos segment is growing its units sales at around 30% with little cash expenditure. Their market share will probably increase over the next decade. However, the market size is uncertain. To my mind it is completely possible that the market size will grow over the next decades. Pricing a business like this with a $PE of 17 is insane to me in the current environment with $PEP at 27. To my mind it is an incredible save and stable business, that will have many more decades of profitability. Maybe we even enter some kind of nicotine renaissance of smoking (or heeting in this case). Maybe even the percentage of users cigarettes and heets user will go up and we enter a ""golden age"" of nicotine, like the 1910-1940s.

P.S. This is my first wallstreetbets post! I was impressed by some good dd and want to contribute.

Rule 201(b) has the following amendments:

(b) (1) A trading center shall establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to:

(i) Prevent the execution or display of a short sale order of a covered security at a price that is less than or equal to the current national best bid if the price of that covered security decreases by 10% or more from the covered security's closing price as determined by the listing market for the covered security as of the end of regular trading hours on the prior day; and

(ii) Impose the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for the remainder of the day and the following day when a national best bid for the covered security is calculated and disseminated on a current and continuing basis by a plan processor pursuant to an effective national market system plan.

(iii) Provided, however, that the policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to permit:

(A) The execution of a displayed short sale order of a covered security by a trading center if, at the time of initial display of the short sale order, the order was at a price above the current national best bid; and

(B) The execution or display of a short sale order of a covered security marked ""short exempt"" without regard to whether the order is at a price that is less than or equal to the current national best bid.

&#x200B;

As most of you, ive spent considerable amounts of time reading up on this very strange occurrance. As I see it, a dip today (or even red numbers this entire week) was to be expected. However, as I did my research, I happened to stumble upon ""[CFR § 242.204 - Close-out requirement](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2018-title17-vol4/pdf/CFR-2018-title17-vol4-sec242-204.pdf)"". I am a swedish law student, so of course this was of huge interest to me, even though I dont know how to refer to it correctly (and also explains why this text is missing some characters). Now, what this text tells me, is that the shorters will **have to** cover their positions sometime this month. [I also read](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) that there is a chance that this is requirement to cover the shorts can be fulfilled by simply using fraudulent shares that do not really exist. However, as lawmakers seem to be looking into what is currently happening, I am not so sure this will be their chosen method, as it means they are basically exposing their fraud for the whole world to see. Of course, another option is for them to see this as perhaps the last time they can save themselves through this loophole before its eventually covered. In my mind, theres a 50/50 chance of either option, however I am certainly hoping for the first alternative.

&#x200B;

Now, for some other thoughts. If the Robinhood-limit is actually set due to liquidity-issues, I believe they would ease up on it at some point during this week, assuming they can manage to locate the liquidity needed for this. IE. - assuming they are not as evil as we might have thought, the demand should rise and the price should go up. If they arent, well I guess we will have to wait and see what happens.

&#x200B;

What however seems pretty clear, at least to me (who doesnt really know what the hell is going on more than what Ive been told and managed to read up on) - something is going on that they dont want the retail investors to know about. Sure, some short positions have been covered (about 37-80% remaining, depending on the source), but how can we know these are legitimately covered, or even have been covered at all, as we dont have the short statistics yet?

&#x200B;

TL:DR - There are laws in place that say the naked shorts have to be covered sometime soon. We dont actually know how many of these are still floating around, or if they even exist anymore (any hedgie with a brain should make sure to try and cover these first), but if there is a substantial amount floating around, we should see a peak when they have to cover. Again, as I am not an american law student, I am uncertain as to how this document should be understood, but this is my understanding.

&#x200B;

Second, if RH is really prohibiting buying because of liquidity-issues, this could probably be resolved during the week, with trading reassumed and demand increasing. If not, well that is clearly beyond my comprehension.

&#x200B;

Third, I dont know where this is going. I am currently holding seven shares bought at 235-289, so you bet I want to see the prices go back to where they were a few days ago. I am also not your financial advisor (obviously), and you should probably not take my word for anything, but the sources i refer to could be a good read.

&#x200B;

I dont actually know if this was even worth reading, but hopefully it could tell you what to look for (and where to find it).

First we know they are usually underestimated (in an order of 10 to 40 times), we know that when the seller does not provide of the stock after T+2 (settlement date) it is then when the transaction is categorised as failed and enters in the ""Failed to delivery"" list.

After T+28 days (or T+30 after the trade date) the share enters the ""Aged failed to deliver"" list if still is not settled.

At this point, the broker was not able to deliver the actual share to the buyer, this results in the broker having to account for the actual share (adjusting its books accordingly).

This could be the reason of why the NSCC asked RH for 3B (a really big number, an order of magnitude bigger from what they are used to). Because they priced the shares actually not existing.

After RH stopped the buying action of shares (which he was not going to be able to deliver), the NSCC lowered the collateral (liquidity) to 700M.

Also not restricting the selling action was benefitial for them because they had to no longer deliver those shares.

RH is still rising as much money as it can (maybe because they are also pricing a necessity to deliver by themselves the actual shares).

As the GME ""failed to deliver"" data spiked as the stock price was rising, the failed to deliver shares are entering the ""Aged fails"" list later this month.

&#x200B;

This is not investment advice, but I think this is a discussion we should have.

From a comment of [r/DustinEwan/](https://www.reddit.com/user/DustinEwan/):

I was actually just looking at this data last night and [compiled a graph and a bit of information correlating the ftds to the price](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9jbc5/listen_to_me_we_cannot_trust_the_short_interest/gljxh9z/).

I've since included the January data released today. [Here's what the updated graph looks like.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT-zGW9XnxrTZIwm5cYOGbu8p9Xn7b9CzoXhl7_BqpkKLHYQmgFt03_OGkbFNXzhCwqqNKNX5brjlK6/pubchart?oid=1460942882&format=image)

And here's a spreadsheet of the source data. This is straight from the SEC link the OP provided:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT-zGW9XnxrTZIwm5cYOGbu8p9Xn7b9CzoXhl7\_BqpkKLHYQmgFt03\_OGkbFNXzhCwqqNKNX5brjlK6/pubhtml](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT-zGW9XnxrTZIwm5cYOGbu8p9Xn7b9CzoXhl7_BqpkKLHYQmgFt03_OGkbFNXzhCwqqNKNX5brjlK6/pubhtml)

To put things in perspective, there are \~69.75m shares of GameStop issued by the company. From January 1, 2020 to January 15, 2021 there have been **81,789,932** failures to deliver.

If all of those FtD's are resulting in IOU's in the market that are never fulfilled (that is, a counterfeit share was created through illegal naked short selling), then GameStop's price would have been diluted by **53.9%**.

Put another way, those participating in naked short selling would have *stole* 53.9% of the market cap from GameStop shareholders. In dollars and cents, that would be a theft of roughly $228,886,696 (assuming a share price of $6.08, which it was on January 1, 2020).

Edit:

Furthermore, if we assume that these hedge funds are continuing to short at the same rate, then at a share price of $300, they would have stolen another **$1,522,481,100** just from January 15 - January 31.

If the price crashes, they get to just pocket all of that. This is why they're pulling out all the stops to kill this thing. They're hoping to catch a falling knife without getting hurt, and the higher they can drive the price without the whole thing exploding in their face, the more they can steal."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082633.csv|DueDiligence|['GME']|['GME']|['I', 'I', 'NSCC', 'RH', 'B', 'RH', 'NSCC', 'M', 'RH', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'SEC', 'OP']|['RH', 'RH', 'RH', 'GME']

If  we sell and the HF's drive the stock back down to lets just say $50 ...  That means all the hedges that spent millions upon millions shorting  the stock in the 2-3-400's have made and absolute killing!! This could  be upwards of a 20-30X gain depending on where they originally shorted  GME and mostly likely it was in the 10-15 range. Even if they shorted it  at its peak in the 40's that is still most likely a 8-10x gain.

We brought it this far, and relenting would be doing a massive disservice to GME for any future plans they have! Since they have not released any news, one can assume they did not take advantage of the 3-400 price range and sell some stock to fill their company's bank. So now with it around $150 and going lower, unless this takes the rocket to Mars, we put them in an even tougher position than before.

Can we trust the #'s every guru seems to be posting on Short % and all that? Who knows! The people dont play fair and there is no telling how many people they paid off to spread fake news!

Been trying to post for days maybe this will be the magic time it gets through.

First of all this chart is one gigantic ascending fucking triangle, 🐂🐂🐂. That’s insanely bullish.

Second the company is sound and has some first mover advantages. First to market EV pickup, The Endurance, expected September 2021. Purchased an GM plant with the capability of producing 600k vehicles a year to help speed up production. 

Third the environment is right. Biden wants the US government to use a 100% EV fleet.  Earnings are expected on 2/15 where they’re pre orders will probably blow expectations out of the water once again, and any mention of a potential government contract would send the stock soaring.

 I’m hoping we break this ascending triangle pattern and ride the EV wave to new highs going into earnings.  Maybe I’ll earn some trendies 🚀🚀🚀🚀but prob not since I’m fucking retarded and live on my wife’s boyfriends couch. This is not financial advice.

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201216005519/en/

>Under the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Aphria will receive 0.8381 shares of Tilray for each Aphria common share, while holders of Tilray shares will continue to hold their Tilray shares with no adjustment to their holdings. Upon the completion of the Arrangement, Aphria Shareholders will own approximately 62 percent of the outstanding Tilray Shares on a fully diluted basis, resulting in a reverse acquisition of Tilray, representing a premium of 23 percent based on the share price at market close on December 15, 2020 to Tilray shareholders. On a pro forma basis for the last twelve months reported by each company, the Combined Company would have had revenue of C$874 million (US$685 million).

The cannabis industry as a whole has extreme growth potential. I recently made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lab9sk/the_rolling_20s_leaps_on_cannabis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) illustrating my views on US Legalization & the opportunity with long term plays. We have entered the ~~roaring~~ rolling 20’s, where cannabis regulations will ease dramatically.

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Aphria & Tilray are slowly taking over Europe. 

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of Aphria, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face to create desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through CC Pharma, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**What is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is a leading German Pharmaceutical and Medical Cannabis Distributor that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

Last week, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group.

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Aphria/Tilray will be first in line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised to be the best.

As long as GME make the most of their new brand image they can easily see Tesla speed growth. They have their work cut out for them but they have the #1 most important thing (brand image). Think how well Elon Musk does with his brand of being the people's champion/saving the world. (whether you believe Elon Musk really is people's champion doesn't matter, the fact is his brand is super effective). People will fear shorting GME in the future (just like they fear shorting Tesla - just look at billions lost by shorters on tesla). For this reason after the short squeeze I will spend about 50% of gains buying back into GME with a target price of $100-$200. 

tldr:

* GME is now a legitimate value investment due to the value of the free marketing/brand image they are receiving.
* Reddit do not forget.
* People will fear shorting GME like they fear shorting Tesla
* Epstein didn't kill himself
* It is just a matter of time until GME start releasing exciting news about how they are using this exposure/branding/money to grow their business.

If any of you cutie pies weren't busy eating crayons and looking at your bedroom wall whilst trying to comprehend the deeper meanings of life, you'd probably have an actual job. The irony here is that I'm going to go about my career in movie production(I know it's not an actual job don't mock me) and what's been going on there for the past few years after Netflix started their expansion. [This](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bOTyoAE6VrRCAZ5GEOg3J?si=Vw4NHRN_TFSsXnCVcleURg) is a really good podcast episode , which I'll TLDR for you cause you retards can't keep your peanut-sized brains concentrated for more than 3 minutes:

Netflix and Amazon have only been gaining profits since covid came to the west and their counterparts - the movie theaters have only been suffering losses. As with any business this creates enormous leverage for both of these companies to  buy off an entire franchise in order to completely monopolize the market.( I don't mean to judge, this is just natural). I guess you could argue that streaming is way more convenient, but if you were to actually read up on that Google Scholar research you'd realize this is not the case for the community and 🦍 just want to look at big screens. The platforms just need more places to display their prepaid Hollywood star-packed productions so that they can earn that sweet sweet money, because you'll all go watch that movie, because of that hot actor/actress (that's right I don't discriminate). And even if that isn't the case(highly doubt it), you'd still watch it because it's Netflix. It's only but natural for them to want to want to buy stocks of movie theaters at a discounted price. Does this remind you of something you should be doing right now? 

All in all this is just some industry insight argumentation that only supports not selling anything be it GME(which hasn't shifted to online only because chairmen didn't want to have to fight with Mr. Bald Headed Smeagle Jeff Bezos(we wouldn't have been in the position we were today if it had)) or AMC, but don't follow it as financial advice, because I, like you, am retarded too."|2021-02-02 17:09:36.920627|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170941.csv|DueDiligence|['AMC']|['AMC']|['I', 'J', 'TLDR', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'AMC', 'I']|['AMC']

I'm not going to repeat all the excellent DD you can already read on the front page. I however will bring up some important thoughts about the publics' spending habits. Buying shares above $150 a share is very expensive for Joe America, average citizen who doesn't do a lot of investments. I have been floored by the number of people willing to spend their real hard-earned money on this movement so far. Congrats to you for keeping all of us afloat. 

We have all seen that VOLUME is very important for keeping GME share price up but volume is not necessary for the ladder attacks to drop the price down. So why haven't they run the price into the ground yet? Because they risk volume jumps. The moment this stock drops below $100/share dramatically increases its affordability. The cheaper it gets the more people will be able to justify adding more to their portfolios. This is exactly what the hedges don't want. They are already in a share shortage. The last thing they want to do is drop the price of GME so low that it causes a massive buying spree. 

So how do they fix this? They do it with FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt). They want the world to think the money train has left the station and all that is left is free fall. They want to crush everyone's spirit so that when it comes time to ground that price, no one will want to buy it. WE CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN. We need to keep our heads high and TRUST that the short positions have not been resolved. We need to TRUST that the Hedges still have a ton of debt obligations that need to be rectified. Any time we see the share price dip below $100 I suggest buying every share you can get your hands on. I know I will. They will be testing the waters over the next few weeks just to see how much enthusiasm is left for this stock. The rollercoaster will get worse. and seeing red for days/weeks is a test of our collective willpower. 

DO NOT SELL WHEN IT JUMPS TO 800. Do not think this is some lucky fluke and to get out while the getting is good. This is WHAT THEY WANT. They want to crush you so that when they give you crumbs you jump on the chance to show some return.

If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.
Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.
I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.
I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use .

1- short the stock cause I wouldn't know how long this would take
2- place a large portion of my bets in put options near zero, cause I would make way more $ that way then just shorting the stock.
3- returned all my used games to GME local strip mall location, cause who else will give me $1 for my old games once GME is no longer?

Focussing on point 2, it's not like you would put billions in a single expriation date. I would probably have splitted this across a couple. Since that trade would have been place 6-12 months prior, probably stick to monthly expriation dates and avoid weekly due to volume needed to be moved.

So Feb 19th is a standard expiration date, so I would expect the short will try to get out 2 days before that day. Probably not successfully do it, and therefore rest will play out at expiration on the 19th. Another chunk will follow the week of March 19th. 

Why not unwind now, it's a losing position and greed will make them want to use as much as the time they can. Because they got burned last time, they won't wait for the 19th, they'll try 2 days before.

Looking at the option calendar, the prior non-weekly expiration was Jan 15th. First expiration of 2021, which would have been a logical date for a first put option taken a year prior. So let's look 2 days before (that's Jan 13th for you artists)... This is when everything really kicked in high gears.

On the 12th GME closed at $19.95, volume of 7M shares (anything prior was also consistently low volume.

But on Jan 13th, volume blew up to 144M shares, GME rose 193% to a high of $38.65 intraday. Looks insignificant today, but that day if was a major change in volume pattern that kicked off what we've seen since.

TLDR: HOLD GME, squeezes happens on monthly expriation calendar, not weeklies. Upcoming one is Feb 19th. So HOLD and buy the dip.

Yes I know it has been quite a harsh week. Manipulation, Counterfeit stock, lazy SEC, fake news, and major loss porn. However, retards strong together.

Please mods, do not just delete this post. I am trying to make a quality post here to show Yahoo Finance we not completely retarded and Gamestop is going to the moon soon.

\---

For years people have thought that investors and market participants are rational. We make choices based on probability and outcome. But here I will give you an example of why we have paper hand bitches in this sub.

Let's say you have to make two decisions.

**Decision 1:**

**A = Sure gain of $240**

**B = 25% probability of a gain of $1000 and 75% probability of a gain of 0$.**

**Decision 2:**

**C = Sure loss of $750**

**D = 75% probability of a loss of $1000 and 25% probability of a loss of 0$.**

&#x200B;

Think about it for a moment before I give the correct answer.

Yes you will take choice A and C. Or B and D if you like to gamble.

But what if we calculate the gains and losses.

&#x200B;

**A & D:**

25% prob. of a gain of $240.75% prob. of a loss of $760 (240-1000).

**B & C:**

25% prob. of gain of $250.75% prob of loss of $750.

So why do you retards pick other choices than B & C, while B&C is the best combi. Because you are subject to **loss aversion.**

What is loss aversion? You facking hate red more than you love green. This is what is happening in the retarded brains of paper hands. You see red, you hate it so much that you don't want to hold for the green at the end of the war.

We tend to accept a sure amount which is less than the maximum amount because you are a fucking paper hand. 

Next to this, you tend to solve the problem in isolation because you are subject to **narrow framing**. You  are so retarded that you only think of green. But do not forget, DFV hold on for over a year. However, he did his math, his DD, his fucking 8-ball game, to know that in the end we will win.

So in short. Switch off you emotions and think about the Gamestop situation as a case. Be aware of the biases and the mind games hedge funds are playing with you right now.

Posting some info on Corsair and for the new members about what we call an 'earnings play'. Corsair manufactures and sells parts for computers, especially gaming computers, as well as the peripherals used in streaming and gaming. Covid has understandably provided a large uptick in sales and we are coming up on Q4 earnings in 8 days, which will include holiday sales. The stock traded as high as $51.37, and has traded between $35 and $45 for some weeks.

What you need to know:

\-Relatively small market cap (3.43 Billion)

\- Q4 Earning's release: Feb 9th.

\- Recently announced a new product (solid state drives) Jan 28th

\- Expected earnings were recently adjusted, higher:

Net revenue: $1,651 million to $1,666 million.

* Operating income: $186 million to $192 million.
* EBITDA: $194 million to $200 million.

\- Tied for first place in the 'computer hardware' category, alongside Logitech

\- Last quarter Corsair reported a 100% earnings suprise (0.52 vs 0.26 earnings per share)

\- Lockup period for sale of insider shares expires Late March, though the recent announcement to sell non-diluted shares direct to institutions at $35 is promising.

&#x200B;

Christmas sales will likely be focused around peripherals, like head phones and streaming gear.

A number of Corsair execs announced they will be selling shares direct, ie. will not dilute common shares, direct to institutional investors at $35 per share. This will, hopefully, reduce volatility in the stock, as there is relatively little available for trade, most of it being locked up with execs and institutional owners. It should also set a floor on near term pricing.

Analyst currently give the company a 'Buy' and 'Strong Buy' rating.

TLDR: buy CRSR.

Earnings date: February 9th.

All time high: $52.37

Current: $38.13

But could you imagine that one of these short squeeze names not only has A LOT more room to squeeze (and hasn’t been restricted by many brokerages), but is still a **value** play even after the massive run on shorts?

That’s what we have with TR.

It’s been pointed out that TR is heavily shorted with 45% of its float short. But if you’re looking for squeeze potential, you should be paying at least just as much attention to days short: if a name has limited liquidity, the shorts will have a hard time exiting their positions regardless of the nominal short interest.

Days short on GME was just 2 as of mid-January, and even at its peak reached no higher than 25 days way back in July. AMC is just 1 day short, and reached no higher than 7 in October.

TR? It’s STILL 45 days short as of the same date.

**GME: 2 days. AMC: 1 day. TR: 45 days.** That’s higher squeeze risk by an order of magnitude going by that metric.

The shorts are 7.3m shares deep in their short positions on TR, but the stock typically trades only 125k shares per day, and it didn’t pick up nearly as much volume as the other squeeze candidates like AMC and EXPR last week. **While AMC, EXPR, etc. are up 3-4x on the squeeze trade, TR is up only 33%. But if TR even begins to make a move similar to theirs, the shorts will have a very hard time exiting due to the tight float and limited liquidity, and the stock could squeeze very, very hard.**

What makes this so potent is the mechanics of the float: just 25% of TR’s shares trade freely. Compare this to 40% for GME and AMC, and as high as 85% for BB and EXPR. There are only so many shares out there that the shorts could possibly cover.

Where are the rest of these shares? They’re with CEO Ellen Gordon, who owns 50% of the common and 85% of Class B shares. Another insider owns another 5% of the common and 15% of the Class B. Gordon has been on the board for 50 years (!) and there is no record of her selling a single share going back to 2000 at least. In fact, no insider has sold a share since 2013, and before that 2008. These are the ultimate diamond hands.

This is effectively a closely-held business that just happens to trade publicly. Worried that we might get burned by insiders like we did on AMC with Silver Lake executing the massive convert and making it easier for shorts to cover? Not here. The insiders don’t sell and the shorts will be stuck covering on the tiny float.

And compare the risk in TR to the other squeeze plays at this stage of the trade. EXPR, AMC, etc. are all up 3-4x over the past week, but are all companies that were and are under legitimate fundamental pressure (as they were even before COVID) and facing real liquidity issues, which is of course why they were so heavily shorted. TR is up just 33% on the squeeze but is absolutely fine financially. Sales have been steady and remarkably consistent at $520-550m for years, and are down just ~10% due to COVID. It has over $100m of cash on its balance sheet and no debt. It generates consistent free cash flow, which was as high as $80m last year. This is a brand that everyone knows with no real lasting fundamental pressures, and is not going away anytime soon.

The kicker? This thing probably has UPSIDE on the fundamentals. It’s very likely that company gets bought out by a strategic buyer once the long-time CEO (now 90 years old) passes away. For how much? TR did $197m of gross profit in 2019. Let’s say it gets bought out by Hershey’s, which probably shares all of TR’s distribution channels and could wipe out just about all of its (extremely bloated) sales, marketing, and administrative spend in a buyout. Tax-affect TR’s gross profit at HSY’s effective tax rate of 17%, apply HSY’s forward P/E of 22-24x, divide by 66m shares outstanding…

**…and you see that TR could easily end up getting bought out for upwards of $60 per share. And that may not be too far off.**

**So why is it still trading at $40 per share even after the run on heavily-shorted names? Beats me. But I’m buying at these levels (as is whoever made those large bullish option purchases late last Friday…).**

**TLDR: This is not just another lottery ticket short squeeze play that’s already been carried into the stratosphere. This is an early-stage squeeze that never got picked up by WSB quite as much as some of the others – and even after the once-in-a-generation broad-based squeeze, this one hasn’t reached nearly its potential given the low float and limited liquidity, which makes its days short ratio 22-45x HIGHER than the other squeeze candidates, and which will make it very, very hard for shorts to cover. TR is up just 33% while the others are up 3-4x, and it’s not even trading where it should be on the fundamentals. If you’re looking for another squeeze candidate (and one which the brokers haven’t restricted as heavily) but are antsy about how extended the high-short-interest basket might be – this is your “value squeeze” play.**

And, honestly, why didn’t this one get picked up as much by WSB? What stock could be more memable than Tootsie Roll? Everyone knows it, everyone loves it…who wouldn’t be tweeting about Tootsie if this got some play?

By the way, unlike AMC, whose theaters are closed across much of the country, TR is a company that we could support **directly** - go out and buy some Tootsie Rolls. Think about the power of the crowd that WSB showed in bringing GME stock to light and apply it to TR: **If we get just 30% of us WSB retards buying the 36-count boxes on their website for our imaginary girlfriends for Valentine’s Day, that’s over $100m in sales, more than 20% of TTM revenue.** Here’s an opportunity not just to buy the stock but to justify it on the fundamentals – by creating the fundamentals.

# SQUEEZE SQUOZE NO NO

Actually it's pretty easy on this one. The short squeeze can happen because of the tremendous amount of shares being shorted, and to those of you saying ""But ... but ... s3 said 50%, they covered and...."" **FUCK YOU ALREADY. DO YOU EVEN RESEARCH?.** Here's a link with ACTUAL bloomberg terminal data : [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labst6/gme\_and\_amc\_short\_data\_taken\_from\_bloomberg/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labst6/gme_and_amc_short_data_taken_from_bloomberg/)See that 31.01.2021 with ""Short"" = 61M on GME ? Yeah ... exactly, not squoze yet. Oh and by the way, for the most retarded of you all, ""**float% = 122%**"" should ring a bell.

If you can't do research this is why the sub is going south.Why would they do this ? Shord ladder drives down the price, so HF can enter lower, make money on the way on top, then short on the top to make money on the way down, (If you think they are not playing both ways, you have nothing to look for here), scaring the paperhands of yours to sell on the way down, helping them get their head out of the water a little bit.

With the new arrival on this sub (Hello 5+ milions people), it has become really a hard moment finding decent answers to our questions and it has become WAY EASIER to concede to FUD because of all the shitposts going on. I'd like to ask this from you now  : Stop shitposting, post with up-to-date data and source (as much as you can), and if you can't, don't post. If you lost 100$, dont post, it's not loss porn and the sub is wallstreet B.E.T.S! If you come to cry for all losses, at least make them a million dollar one, or else stfu. I'm getting tired of the crybabies.

Also bring back position or ban; and i mean actual **BAN.**

pos : GME : 214 @\~200 average; no other position cause fuck off.

What this means is it can’t be shorted when dropping in price. Only when rising in price. It’s a small victory but should prevent short ladder attacks that have taken us so low this past few days. Couple this with relaxation of restrictions on buys but add to this the restrictions outside of USA it should slowly rise. 
This post explains it as I’m a retard and haven’t a clue what I’m saying. 

Short sale restriction is a rule that came out in 2010 and it's also referred as the alternate uptick rule, which means that you can only short a stock on an uptick. This is kind of an unusual thing when you first think about it. It restricts the ability to short a stock as it's dropping down. You will note that there is no such thing as a long buy restriction where you can't buy a stock as it's going up.

This rule was designed to prevent downward really volatility. It was designed to prevent flash crashes and big drops in the market by making it so if a stock dropped more than 10% vs the previous day's close, and that could happen at any time during the day, if it drops more than 10% vs the previous day's close, then at that time short sale restriction would be turned on. If you wanted to short the stock, you could only short it when it's going up. You can't basically use a market order. You can only get in on a limit order on an uptick.
This has the effect of making it difficult to short a stock that has short sale restriction. Because it's difficult to short, what we'll sometimes see is that stocks that have been really strong for the last few days ... Let's say yesterday a stock squeezes up from $4 all the way up to $5 all the way up to $6. Then the next day it opens at let's say $5.25. It opens down 10% from the previous day. Then the bell rings and it drops to $4.85, now dropping another 10%. Short sale restriction is turned on. It's down more than 10% versus the previous day's close. Then it starts to squeeze back up on a red to green move.
Now as it surges up traders who are thinking man, I want to short this stock if it hits $6.00, which is the previous day's high, well they can only short it as it's going up. They can't short it as it turns around. That sometimes means there's going to be an imbalance between buyers and sellers, and there will be more buyers and less sellers and short sellers because it's just not as easy to short the stock.

Only then will they maybe get margin called or trigger their risk protocols.

This depends crucially on the price they started shorting. For example, if a HF shorts 1000 shares of GME at $4, and it is now $100, they have $4000 cash and a short interest of $100,000, with a loss of $96,000. Meanwhile a hedge fund that shorted at $300 and the stock is now $100, is sitting on $300,000 cash, a $200,000 gain, and $100,000 short interest.

Unfortunately, according to Ihor/S3's data (giving him the benefit of the doubt), the current GME short interest is 8.8 billion on 27 million shares shorted. This means the current shorts started at $325 dollars a share. For us to meaningfully hurt their books we would have to drive the share price to like $400-$600 \*without\* a short squeeze before a short squeeze happens. That takes a lot, specifically 10s of billions of dollars, so I don't see that happening soon, even with whales etc. on our side. Sadly, the broker shenanigans seem to have given them a chance to slip out.

(GME data: [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356261806612885509](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356261806612885509) )

So now what? The best we can do is hold and wait for material events to happen related to the turnaround. As Ryan Cohen succeeds, we will have the winds behind our back to try this again in a few months.

In the meantime, consider these stocks instead: FUBO and BBBY. Both have decent businesses and high short interest at a reasonable price.

FUBO is a growing streaming platform that is great for live sports. It is growing and has a lot of wall street analyst support. It is heavily shorted at 67% of float, with the shorts in at $50. Wall street analysts have also recently set 50 price target, and the stock is at 50. FUBO is thus a great candidate to paint some HF books red.

BBBY is not as good of a target, but has a credible turnaround story like GME, and is currently sitting at $26 dollars, with the shorts in at $52 according to S3. This could move with an order of magnitude less capital than GME before the shorts start seeing losses.

Happy hunting.

So we all know that NOK is a value play. This further puts NOK as leader in the tech right now. They already have a ton of contracts dealing with 5G. They are talking about 1T, but today announced 10G rollout as well. If that doesnt mean anything I dont know what does. The down play in the market today is because of its link in the BANG gang. Most of the other 3 have dropped, pulling it down as well. But dont let that fool you. Its a long play. IT IS IN NO WAY A SHORT PLAY... We really have to drill that into peoples heads. .... and for sake of my self.... I'm not a financial advisor... LOOK AT THE NEWS....

Following up with a 3rd DD after posting these gems last year: [$OZK](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j52m4n/bank_ozk_the_new_century_financial_of_the_current/) &  [$FIT](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j9zayy/why_fitbit_will_trade_higher_than_735_acquisition/). Both were excellent disasters, so sorry to the degens who followed me down those holes. Nonetheless, I doubled down on my $OZK play because I still think they're shit. 

Moving on, I believe $BLUE is on the verge of FDA approval for one or both of it's key gene therapy drugs. The company currently has a beta thalassemia drug conditionally approved in the EU (Zynteglo), and has a sickle cell drug that's awaiting approval. Last year was rough for the company as it struggled to get approvals, while it continued to burn through cash on its cancer drug research.

The company will be splitting off the cancer division later this year into a separate company, so it can enable both new companies to focus better on their respective applications. As a result, $BLUE is trading below 50% of where it was a year ago, despite having two fully developed drugs in the pipeline.

On to the DD: $BLUE has just posted a role on its website for a VP of US Sales for Zynteglo and the Stem Cell drug [Career Site Link](https://boards.greenhouse.io/bluebirdbioinc/jobs/2291768). These roles are expensive and hard to fill in Boston, indicating that $BLUE feels like they'll need a US sales team soon.  

The Play: Jan 21 2022 Call, $85 strike. It's currently trading at $3.90 per contract. The option will pay out a 100% gain if $BLUE increases to $90 by December '21. Considering this stock reached a high of $230/share on successful trial news, an FDA approval will send this stock soaring. Obviously there's huge risk here, but $BLUE seems to think things are looking up based on their hiring.

TLDR: $BLUE is a pharma stock trading at a discount considering FDA approval may be imminent; they just posted job openings for a US sales VP."|2021-02-02 17:09:36.920627|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170942.csv|DueDiligence|['FDA']|[]|['DD', 'I', '$OZK', 'I', 'I', '$BLUE', 'FDA', 'EU', '$BLUE', '$BLUE', 'VP', 'US', '$BLUE', 'US', '$BLUE', 'FDA', '$BLUE', '$BLUE', 'FDA', 'US', 'VP']|[]

I   am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I barely   understand how the stock market works. Professionally I'm a   computational researcher -- my job is to simulate complex systems that   my smooth brain barely understands.

Okay fellow retards,

loooong time lurker and europoor autist. So excuse my spelling. Let’s brake some things down:

SILVER:

It’s   a real well played scheme on this. You have to remember there is a   dragon in the east, where people have a historically deep bonding to   silver. And the dragon looooves to take a gamble. So, number one   priority for Melvin and hedge fund friends is to distract the dragon   from GME with shiny silver. Imagine HFs did not throatfuck GME on   Thursday and the dragon banged into the marked, heavy. This uprising of   the dragon is exactly what this autist observed by comments on wsb late   Wednesday, early Thursday. If HFs didn’t screw the market exactly this   moment and pulled some silver shiny stuff out of their pockets, they   would have already been toast.

Besides   that, try to find silver shorts/put options for a reasonable   spread/price which are also available to buy. I tried the whole day   yesterday but at least at my europoor broker I couldn’t find a single   one. What tells you that? Looks like **smart money is not buying the silver rush**.

&#x200B;

ANTI GME  BOTS:

These guys are getting their **bots more and more angry and aggressive**   over the last 24h. But why would they still take the effort, if they  already hit their targets? All this shows to my retarded autist smooth   brain is that they are in deep fear! Hey, bot guys I just want to quote   one of your clients: “What's your beef with me. I'm just trying to make  a  living just like you” ...I hope you guys got payed in advance,  because  your clients will likely go out of business!

Anyways... just to repeat **the obvious: They try to create fear among you retards** and make your diamond hands become weak ass toilet paper!

To   close this part I just want to quote some famous investor from Omaha:   (Be) “fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are   fearful.” I’m an autist, I don’t feel fearful at all. I simply can’t…   But for some reason the bot guys are. They seem fearful as fuck to me.

&#x200B;

SHORT INTEREST RATIOS:

So I hope most of you guys realized, they simply changed the formula to calculate **SI rates**. It’s basically **still \~120%**.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read\_this\_they\_are\_screwed\_numbers\_dont\_lie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/)

In science you would say they normalized the standardization:

You   take your observed value also into account and add it to your base   value. Eventually your maximum number can only be <=1 or in other   terms <=100%, In this specific case you take your number of shorted   stocks and add them to the float as a base value. Then you divide your   number of shorted stocks by the base value (including shorted stocks)   which can only be smaller then 1 or 100% in respective. ...inflate the   base to make things look completely different… Anyways my smooth brain   is able to convert the equation to the old standard (shorts/float) which   is based on S3s latest 55% short interest rate (Just to make it easy  for your autist brains):

shorts/(shorts   + float) = 0.55 → 0.45/0.55 shorts = float  -> 0.81 shorts = float   →  shorts = 1/0.81 float = 1.23 float or 123% of float.

[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)

...in   addition you have to keep in mind, big players always have taken fines   and trials into consideration as costs. I don’t know what the fines  for  misinformation regarding number of shorted stocks are, but if you  are  scared to death you should:

First   of all, not show it to your retarded smooth brained enemies by   recruiting bot armies, obviously lying, silver bullshit, other FUD,   ...you name it.

AND you are   willing to take any risk to survive. ...or fines   ...in this kind of   situation probably any kind of fines no matter what.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But  why would they do this? Whats their business with the Hfs? You ask  yourself? You guys are threatening soooo many business models in   finance. And this is the real **game changer**!

Keep   in mind: On stock markets you mainly trade the future. You have to  make  scenarios for the upcoming future. And there is a horrifying  scenario  for boomer financial services arising at the horizon. But  first let’s  bring it to the crucial point first:

Look for **information asymmetries**,   google it or whatever… That’s what it’s all about in the end. That’s   the main reason why big players make shit tons of money from small   players. It’s all about information sovereignty. Or the information   monopoly… however you call it. The one who is (quicker) capable to   gather more accurate information and hide it from others, wins. Like   buying your investment decisions and order limits from RobinHood.   Sometimes it’s even enough to convince your enemy that you are in   possession of better information. (By the way, this fight about   information sovereignty is exactly what you can observe right now. HFs   try to convince you retards that they have better and more accurate   information about the whole situation.)

So, lets come back to the bullet point:

Imagine   a huge crowd of people on social platforms gathering more and more   accurate information and take investment decisions on that. Because of   declining information asymmetries constantly draining money out of it.   This will drastically change the current state of the market in means of   clients to financial service provider relations. Making it a more   liberated, fairer market in some kind. ...the whole industry would lose   trillions in the future. So yeah, you guys did it. You scared a big   chunk of the whole financial sector.  Not with GME in particular but with this way of investing.   Therefore from the financial industries point of view this transition  process MUST be stopped and delayed at any cost. This is literally the  clusterfuck for boomer financial services! And the worldwide media and   wsb are the battlegrounds right now.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But   hey, I’m just a short minded, stock loving retard, having a lot of fun  on this! GME to the moon! Planing to buy some dips today because I’m  way  to autistic to feel anxious about ridiculous 100 stocks short  ladder  ping pong.

(written Monday so ""tomorrow"" = Tuesday 2nd"")

If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.

If you don't sell, the price won't go down. Buy and hold on mass can make everyone, especially the initial investors very rich. It is the basis for the recent gains in tech. The public sentiment is creating value in many of these companies. Just look at ZM. It's a direct consequence of democratized trading and it will become more and more influential. 


Everyone has the misconception that a stock's price is determined by some true value+potential of the company. In fact, the potential of a company is actually in part a function of stock price. This means that a large group of buyers of the stock can directly fund as well as motivate managers and CEOs to stay interested in building a successful company. I'm sure the new management doesn't want to squander our support. The price is a barometer of public reputation which is a strong indicator of longevity. That's what the market wants most in the end. 

Democratizing trading will allow publicly popular companies to redeem themselves financially. In a sense, it is a safety net of public faith. If gamestop management can capitalize on our support, the is real potential it can turn itself around. I spoke to a relative of mine who was a former manager at a gamestop who said that the new management dreams of turning stores into social hubs like Starbuck's. By cultivating a friendly environment for gamers, they can capitalize on an open market. This will be especially successful if a roaring 20s type decade unfolds (assuming the vaccine is successful in stopping the virus, which it is poised to do so far according to researchers like Nicholas Christakis at Yale).  This would ensure gamestop becomes a physical environment of the gaming community for the foreseeable future, occupying a niche I think no other company is better positioned to seize. 


I say let's fund that dream and reap the spoils.

First – Monke Diamond Hands Banana Rocket Rocket Rocket Rocket Moon

**This is not financial advice. This is speculation based on my limited understanding of SEC rules and documents. Sources linked.**

**TLDR**: My opinion is that Shorts will continue to drive the price down with ladders and try to break the chain of consecutive days where GME is listed as a threshold security. **They need at least 1 non-Failure To Deliver day before EoD Thursday. If they get even 1 day without aggregate Failure To Deliver then the entire 13 consecutive day count restarts. They need 5 consecutive days without aggregate Failure To Deliver to have GME fully removed as a threshold security. Selling is good for them and bad for diamond hands. Ape strong together. Diamond Hands get the Rocket Ship.** No idea if achieving 13 consecutive days will force the squeeze or not.

My opinion is that Shorts don’t plan to cover their position by Tuesday. They don’t have to. Instead, they will drive the price down for as many days as possible and attempt to break the chain of consecutive settlement (read: business) days where they fail to deliver. GME has been listed as a **threshold security** (see below) for 10 consecutive business days (please check my math. I had to count on my fingers). Shorts need to break that chain before it reaches **13 consecutive business days**. “Participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in ‘threshold securities’ if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.” \[SEC Rule 204\] (link below)

**If diamond handed monke can HOLD strong and reach 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, then the shorts will have to cover the position by buying GME shares or equivalent shares of like kind and quantity. If maths good, that puts Thursday Feb 4th as day #13. Ape hold strong.**

We've seen confusion, fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding what happened Monday Feb 1st. Remember that FUD is one of their greatest weapons against retail investors right now. They want to use it to divide retail and to convince people to sell based on emotion. I’M NOT FUCKING SELLING!

Warning: I am not a financial professional or a financial advisor. I read at a grade-3 level. This is not financial advice.

\*Read below here if you can or care.

1. Why no squeeze Monday after $320+ close on Friday?

Shorts weren’t required to cover their positions on Monday. I think that they have T+2 (time of close + 2 business days) to cover their position. If true, this means they have until EoD Tuesday to cover. After that, they will have failed to deliver on the security. That isn’t good for them, but it isn’t as bad as it sounds. Failure to deliver is like a steppingstone in the process. After 5 consecutive business days with Failure To Deliver, the stock is listed as a security threshold. NYSE Threshold Securities can be checked here [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

It takes 13 consecutive days being listed as a security threshold before the positions must be closed (If the rules still apply to them).

So, instead of covering, shorts spent the day driving the price down to a more favorable position for them. They may have scared away some paper hands along the way too.

2. How does that help the shorts?

Lower price means it costs less to cover and the Shorts have more room to negotiate with other funds. A cheaper darkpool buyout is good for them. If they can lower it enough, covering becomes a non-issue compared to a full on squeeze.

Shorts want to avoid days where GME fails to deliver and they want to create non-Failure To Deliver days to break the chain of consecutive failures to deliver. This is easier for them if the price is lower.

3. So squeeze on Tuesday/Wednesday right?

I don’t think the squeeze happens Tuesday or Wednesday. I think the shorts are setting up the next part of their plan. I think if the squeeze happens this week, it happens because the shorts reach 13 consecutive days where they fail to deliver. This means diamond hands and limiting the number of cheap shares that shorts can buy after ladder attacks aka diamond hands.

4. We’ve heard this before. So what?

I agree with the idea that adding RC & friends to the board had a positive influence on the stock price. I don’t think that was the only thing happening when we saw price rise during mid-January. Going back to the idea of 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, we can refer to our NYSE tracker [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

Starting at the beginning of the year, we see that Jan 4th is the first day GME is marked as a threshold security. It stays listed as a threshold security through Jan 15th. Remember we don’t count weekends so the count resumes January 18th. On the 18th, it falls off the list for the day and comes back on January 19th. Without this single day drop-off, the 13-day countdown would have ended at EoD Wednesday Jan 20th. I believe that the price jump we saw can be partially attributed to the fact that shorts NEEDED to avoid another Failure To Deliver or they would risk being uncovered. That was pre-spike. Now they are in a similar position closing in on the 13th consecutive day. They will do whatever they can to avoid that 13th consecutive day because that means they will avoid having their record books searched through by someone outside their firm/fund.

**Threshold Securities**

Def: Threshold Securities are equity securities that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for

· Five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency; and

· Totaling 10,000 shares or more; and

· Equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer’s total shares outstanding.

If you see any mistakes or if I missed something, let me know. Looking to keep this as accurate and up to date as possible.

Conclusion: Hold banana with diamond hands to board the rocket ship

First post here. 

Listen up, I want to talk about the volume charts on GME along with everything we’re seeing right now to help you make the decision to be a 💎🙌 chad or paper handed b***. 

My thesis: GME to the moon, and the negative price movement we’re seeing right now is a non-fucking-issue. 

Some facts:
-RH restricted trading for GME past few days pushing price down synthetically 
-silver bots spamming WSB
-simultaneous coordinated media attacks to control the narrative telling us that retail has pivoted to silver
-Melvin down >50% in JANUARY (oops)
-S3 data looks fishy 

So back to the volume charts. “Oh shit GME is down” whatever, it doesn’t matter. Here’s why I’m confident that this is purposeful, possibly short ladder attacks. 

At open 1/28, 2/1 and 2/2 MASSIVE volume for those days both at open pushing the price down, which was followed by low volume. 

My interpretation: HFs trying to dispel hype and our faith by large volume selling at open (look at counterfeit stocks, can’t find link) to depress price and kill momentum. 

Not financial advice, just my interpretation and why I’m down 50% but don’t fucking care. 💎🙌

""If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.

Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.

I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.

I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.""

I see some WSB posts that are totally panicked. We need to remember why we are here in the first place. Do you want to see the Hedge funds win? NO! then HOLD THE LINE AND DON'T SELL!!!! 💎🤲💎

I got a few PMs about my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laww2w/legit_proud_of_all_of_you_for_not_selling_this/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and what that little blue line called on balance volume, or OBV means. OBV basically gets a positive or negative value based on if the prices are going up, or going down at that time. So in theory, when price rises, OBV should rise at the same rate to that increase, and vice versa. 

However, the useful thing about OBV is in the name - it's weighted by volume. This means the more shares that are bought/sold, the steeper the OBV line (or gradient). So in this gamestop selling run, we would expect such a crazy price decrease to be followed by a similarly crazy decrease in on balance volume, since a lot of shares would not be in the hands of retail investors, theoretically. However, the OBV line has barely moved. What this means is that the price has decreased far below what most people are holding it for, comparing it to the first OBV rise last week when everyone bought into GME. This in turn means that the price is being changed by barely anything, and it really hangs in the balance of a few trades right now.

**But what are the statistics???**

In today's price drop we saw 5 million shares negatively impact OBV against a total balance of 1.1 billion, that's a factor of 0.5% and is microscopic compared to a daily increasing rate of 25% last week. That's why everyone here is going on about volume - there isn't any. If you're still confused, go on tradingview and bring up the on balance volume indicator, and look at the past 7 trading days.

My theory is that they were dumping a lot of stocks onto the market to make it seem like the stock is plummeting. Just look at this bid with 30k shares:

&#x200B;

[a lot of ask's with a \(relatively\) big volume at once ](https://preview.redd.it/8rrkvhr133f61.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=21f0ed5ea7661f596f47ec077aaa851114c46611)

The good news is that it seems like they can't keep up with the volume since most of us are holding the stock, and because most retail investors already bought GME, it seems like the demand is going down.

&#x200B;

[Here you can clearly see that the volume of stocks being dumped on the market is going down.](https://preview.redd.it/16dezk0l33f61.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=a070b8551318b19742b7514028b569e50eeb5a4d)

So what does that mean for us? As long as we're not able to match the dumping of shares onto the market with enough demand the price will probably continue to go down, but that doesn't matter as long as we keep holding with our FUCKING DIAMOND HANDS 💎🤲!!

Sometimes it feels like you are all alone with owning this stock. And it would be nice to have some discussion about the company, and to hear other investors' views on the stock and the company. Which, in my opinion, is not necessarily the same thing. The company is doing very well, but what about the share? Nothing!! Why?

It is very difficult for me to understand that we are still at these low levels!
When the oil price has recovered to over $50 and stands at $57/brent at the time of writing. We should get up to the levels we had at the end of 2019 and start in 2020!! To begin with…

”So only there is a nice rise for the stock!”

Certainly the oil price was higher then between 60-65$ barrel. 
But then there was also uncertainty surrounding krg's payments, which were not paid between Nov-19 and Feb-20 of $41.7 million. Which we will probably soon see start being paid back. At least if we are to believe in Genel, GKP and Dana Gas who have notified the market of this.

Below I have gathered a few things that make me look bright on the future and that the stock feels interesting to own.


Refund from KGR

That we see  KRG begins repayment of the debt for delivered oil between Nov-19 and Feb-20 of 41.7 million dollars. If we get this money into the bank, it looks very good for the valuation and cash flow!

https://genelenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Genel-Resumption-of-override-payments-FINAL-11.12.20.pdf 

https://www.danagas.com/media/press-releases#sec-5986 

https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/gulf_keystone_petroleum/news/rns/story/w6qe47r  

Why doesn't SNM do the same? And why don't they answer the question of refunds and give feedback to the market when I ask them? Is this in Taqa or what is it that is taking so long? Here I see the closest trigger for the stock! So it's very frustrating that they don't communicate this course-driven information to the market! 

I think they can be much better at communicating to the market, what the stock needs are new buyers and higher turnover to attract interest from larger investors. Which is an absolute prerequisite for an higher valuation of the company. Here, the company management needs to become much more active in its actions regarding marketing the company. Why don't they do more to be seen?






Increase in Company Gross 2P Reserves

We should expect an update before February is over. There can certainly be positive surprises here. What is interesting is our reserves in relation to our production and what has been communicated around development plans for the field. I can't make up the math here. www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5222/corporate_presentation_-_dec_2020.pdfPage 2 108.5 million barrels 2P/C It produces today according to page 4. An average of 46,300 barrels per day with an ambition to raise these significantly. To 80 000-100 000 a day!108 500 000 / 46300 = 2344 / 365 = 6.5 So in about 6.5 years, you're out of oil? No, I don't think so. More oil will be transferred to 2P/C but the question is how much and when it will happen? 

How much oil is there in Atrush? I believe in a lot of oil...



KRG and Baghdad
Will we finally see a solution between KRG and Baghdad on the budget? And what will it mean for IOCs operating in KRG if SOMO receives 250 bpd, will Baghdad see the contracts as legal? And how will investors view the companies operating in Kurdistan? Does some of the risk disappear? And the companies get a completely different valuation?

Sarsang and Total

Very exciting things are happening in the neighboring block, Sarsang, where Total is possibly on its way to sell its share of 18%. According to Bloomberg, Total believes it can get up to $ 500 million for its part. And if they get close to that price, that would be very positive, for the valuation of nearby Atrush! And who could be the buyer? I think that the Russian companies in particular is strengthening its presence in the area. But time will tell. 

www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-04/total-said-to-be-in-talks-to-sell-stake-in-kurdistan-oil-field   


Plan for expansion

It will be very interesting to see if there are any decisions, about expanding the field to 80-100bopd. This was to be decided on, in 2020 but was put on hold when Covid-19 became a fact and the oil price crashed. But now it's time I think to make a decision on the issue regarding the future expansion of the field. 

Page 3. www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5158/2019-12-snm-cp.pdf 

Here I see the greatest potential for an upgrade of the company. Here, future company value and future belief regarding Atrush's ability to be the company's basis for stability and sole asset are determined. I would like to see the use of cash flow to acquire new assets. And that the company can grow further with higher share prices as a result! 





”Installation of Second Trainat Early Production Facility""

I think it is very interesting to look back at information that the company has given before. To create an image of where they are today or in the near future. If you look at the presentation from August. 

Page 8 www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5196/corporate_presentation-shamaran-rev10.pdf 

So it will be very interesting regarding the opportunity to see an increase of production in the very near future. Wonder how far the company has come?

”Installation of Second Trainat Early Production Facility. Second productiontrain (EPF.T2) brings current Atrush processing capacity in line with well capacity circa 58Mbopd.” 

Is it already installed and they can easily screw up prod 10,000 barrels / day? There is a lot that justifies this, among other things, if you get the debt back from Nov-Feb faster. That calculation becomes much more appealing if you count on 55$ barrels/brent, which we are a bit over now at the time of writing, and a production of 58,000 barrels / day. I do not see it as completely unlikely that in the foreseeable future we will hear from the company that they will increase production to these levels. This is, after all, information from August and it is quite reasonable that we are there today.


Conditions for earning. As everyone knows, the price of oil is very important. And here I think we will see a surprisingly large re-inhibition of the prize in 2021. What happens to the oil price is always uncertain as it can change overnight both up and down. But there is much to suggest a strong recovery in demand. And this, at the same time as investment in the sector has been declining for several years. This could be a perfect storm for oil prices if supply cannot meet demand. Shamaran produces at a very low cost and here there is an incredible leverage with a higher oil price.
www.macrovoices.com/guest-content/list-guest-publications/4009-art-berman-macrovoices-jan-7-2021/file
And for every dollar that the oil price increases by, the higher the earnings for snm. Here I think the market will change attitudes towards oil stocks overall in line with a higher oil price.

36mil in volume is not a lot! These guys shorted around $5 so unless the stock hits $5 you're fine. Even then, you're fine if we don't sell. Don't be paper handed. Most retailers are still holding.

This is a once in a lifetime chance. Red is just a color, it will change if you hold and buy the dip. I plan on buying more near end of day myself!

**The short itself will probably happen after Thursday Feb. 4th.** This is because that would be the 13th consecutive day of Failure to Deliver on a threshold security. But this only happens if the shorts can't deliver the shares they owe. They're trying to illegally drive the price down so when they buy back they can avoid a squeeze. I'm a literal retard, but I have a feeling the price is gonna start going back up on Thursday or next week. Maybe someone can explain more

**Retail investors own over 100% of the actual shares. This means the price goes as high as we want it to go. It will keep climbing until we sell. They are using every trick in the book because they know they're f*cked! This is literally free money if we all hold. There is nothing they can do but try to scare you.**

I sold my meager 40 shares like a paper handed bitch a few days ago, but have seen the error of my ways and I've been buying back in. I'm going to buy over 40 shares this time to make up for it. HOOOOOLD.

Lastly, remember to remove your stop losses so you don't sell!

For SEC interns, this is not financial advice. Idk what I'm talking about. I like the stock. Ryan Cohen is great.

**EDIT:** [More on the whole 13 consecutive days bit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/layb2c/cutting_through_fud/)

**EDIT 2:** I am speculating on when the short squeeze will happen but I'm a retard. You hold this stock even if Feb 4th comes and goes.

I know it’s a joke around here, too many words can’t read, I get it. Information is a valuable weapon, stop voluntarily ignoring it.

I am not a financial advisor, I just like the stock, and that is why I am going to provide some insight into how GME arrived to the position they are in, and how WSB arrived to the position we are in now.

**GameStop Backstory**

I will briefly cover the backstory of GameStop, but for more accurate information and in depth discussion I recommend you listen to Rod Alzmann’s GME DD as a guest on the Modern Guilt podcast found on Spotify. 

Essentially, GameStop began to slip as E-commerce grew and management went through several changes before arriving at what we have now. As a result, earlier management tried to pivot away from GameStop’s core competencies (large user base and trade-in/second hand sales) which pushed it further into misfortune. Eventually the board we have now chose to double down on their core competencies and improve upon them rather than restructure entirely.

**WSB Backstory**

Leading up to the now viral GME bonanza, this sub and the strategies used were much different. GME started off as a value play, although a significant subsection of that following always had their eyes on a potential squeeze play. The following was small at first, but grew as GMEs potential grew. The core competencies of the following consisted of excellent DD, knowledgeable users willing to share research, and less knowledgeable users willing to learn.

I no longer feel as though this is the core competency of GME gang, the strategy has shifted towards strength in numbers and raw unadulterated conviction. That is not a bad thing and I will get to that later.

Once the GME squeeze became apparent and the sub was soon consumed almost entirely by GME gang, the original competencies actually flourished. Users provided excellent research on the mechanisms at which hedge funds could be held at bay in the midst of the squeeze. The prevailing strategy was to buy shares only, never use margin or over leverage yourself, and not to purchase options. 

Those competencies were what made WSB unstoppable in the begging, and they were based on pure reason alone. Buying shares would reduce float and put pressure on HFs, avoiding margin and over leveraging would prevent users from panic selling or liquidating due to margin calls, and avoiding options would concentrate power into a strategy that gave hedge funds little wiggle room.

These strategies worked, and you can check the first week and a half of the GME movement to confirm that it was rock solid. But then something happened, people saw opportunity and started buying options on the side or completely instead of shares. Because of the original momentum this actually ended up benefitting the strategy significantly, it resulted in all calls ending ITM on the Friday before last week, it produced a gamma squeeze.

But that tactic is short lived, the MMs quickly started writing a vast spread of options and priced many users out with premium. **The options strategy is no longer feasible in the near term, momentum is gone and the options ladder spreads traders too thin.**

I understand the allure of options, but just consider the amount of money that vanished last Friday. Calculate the cost of all of those options from $330-$800 and consider how much ammo was wasted. Yes, it was stolen form you, it wouldn’t have happened if not for manipulation and brokers blocking GME buys, but it is time to adapt and overcome.

**Return to your core competencies, and improve upon them. Stop ignoring thorough DD and stop neglecting to do your own, do not allow your fellow members to post information without scrutiny. Return to the original thesis**

**Improve the Core Competencies**

We are in a grim stage of the squeeze and many are nervous, but it is essential at this point to steer into the skid. **If you read anything in this post it should be this.** The stock price falling gives us strength if you look past the fear. The squeeze is about leveraging the small amount of float that is urgently needed by hedge funds. Hedge funds have an abundance of money, but they lack the volume to close their positions. Individual retail investors lack money but they are capable of leveraging the scarce volume available against HFs. 

Think about this, HFs are burning money to drive the price down but they need shares to stop bleeding. When the price is low, retail investors become more capable of obtaining shares. The price being low puts HFs in a **bad position**. At low prices retail investors are able to hoard large quantities of shares, further increasing the scarcity. For those of you who bought or are willing to buy at $250, $300, $400 etc, I salute you but I don’t encourage this behavior. 

Buying high spreads your resources thin and results in diminishing returns. **Let them trigger the short sell rule, let them give you a discount**

A squeeze can start at $1 or $1000, it doesn’t matter, and the base cost of the stock equally doesn’t matter in an infinity squeeze.

Return to your core competencies, allow hedge funds to bleed themselves dry in their effort to deter us by lowering the stock price. Buy when the price is cheap, allow it to inflate naturally, and wait for it fall again before loading up more. Once the resources are entirely out of reach for the hedge funds, there are three ways to win. A positive catalyst, natural price growth, or simply allowing them to bleed themselves to death.

Options are no longer effective, consolidate your efforts.

Do your part to spread and scrutinize important information. 

Stop slacking and letting others pick up the work for you. If you’re still on Robinhood, set up a fidelity account or an alternative immediately. If you’re still on margin take it off. If youre still allowing your broker to lend your shares call them. Get extended hours trading. Get off toxic brokerage platforms.

Return to your core competencies and stop running in circles.

I am not a financial advisor, nothing in this post should be used as investment advice. This is my take on a purely speculative situation, and I recommend you do your own research before entering or exiting any trade. I like the stock and own GME shares.🚀🚀

**TL:DR: for starters, stop slacking off and actually read DD posts, information is essential in warfare. Stop buying options, they were an effective weapon that was purposefully neutralized by MMs and now works against us. Return to the strategy that got us to this point.**

**The price dropping allows retail investors to maximize the effectiveness of the only weapon they truly have against HFs**

This is for the GME boyz

Just like last week, we are under a low-volume short ladder. And just like last week, bulls are hindered by brokerages' restrictions.

However, a remarkable thing happened today: GME tested a previous ATH/resistance ($76.76). GME first pulled back from that price point on Jan 21st, when the price opened at $42 and closed in the $60s. It was the first day ever trading was halted intraday, and our first massive win against hedge funds. $76.76 slapped us in the face and called us his bitch.

**So, why is today's price action bullish?**

Because when a stock tests previous ATHs and it **BOUNCES OFF OF THEM**, thus turning a resistance into a support, it's a sign that the stock is still healthy and has potential for an even more powerful run. **PLTR did that, NIO did that too in the past.** They went sky high (not as GME duh), tested previous ATHs, then kept flying to their own moon trips.

Now look at GME recovery.

And imagine how high it's going to fly again once brokerages let us monkeys out of our cages by lifting restrictions. Yes, GME could test the $500 resistance again after testing the $76.76 resistance now turned into support.

Guys, I don't have the vocabulary to explain how bullish this is in my opinion. I am blessed I can buy GME on my broker, looking forward for an amazing run through Q4.

**To GME newbies: this has always been a Q4 play. I was expecting the squeeze to happen after Q4 ER revealed what a powerhouse GME is, and I still do. Accumulate, hold, squeeze, cheer.**

I am sure we have many soldiers with dry powder ready to go once their RH debacle frees up. 

But we will not last until more troops arrive if we do not push back now. Etoro forced sales on GME, cash app restricts buying, many more platforms restricting buy side; they’re throwing everything they got at us. They’re trying to change the narrative of short interest. This isn’t just about the hedge funds anymore; it’s the whole system up to the market makers who have dropped the ball.  We need to buy in order to live to fight. Chamath and Cuban hints at the power we have, holding isn’t the right message now. Our power lies in retard strength. And now, I am willing to get even more retarded!

First, non of this is financial advise&I'm not a financial advisor
Secondly, I'm not sure if this fits in DD since this is more psychology so mods please correct the flair if I'm using the wrong one.

That being said:
I know y'all retarded apes don't want to read, but bear with me here. 
The current fact we all first need to acknowledge is that the price of GME has dropped significantly, and that the volume, albeit still low, is higher than yesterday to say the least. People have started to sell, and other where on Reddit people are starting to belief this thing is all over and we're a bunch of cultists.
Now the question I know y'all want to know: Is it over yet?
Short answer:Likely not, but it depends on us.
The very basis of the reason many of us believe GME with go to the moon in the first place, that it is HEAVILY shorted, *still holds true*. According to the volumes for the last few days, the restrictions still going on, and the media fake-silver hype, the HFs likely haven't covered their positions yet. Many of them likely even added new ones, as they believe the price is going to fall. The potential for going to the moon is always there, it never changed. What has changed, and can potentially truly wreck this spaceship, is our mentality. Due to the price drop, which, started with the HFs with their dirty tricks, people are starting to panic, and this panic, which is caused by a false manipulation, CAN wreck GME. People are less likely to buy in as they're afraid this is not ending well, and people are more inclined to sell due to the dropping and seeing all the other people selling.
*Spamming 💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌 will NOT stop people from selling or panicking. It only serves to make them think we're a cult*

*What to do*
What is important as of now, whether you're still in, already sold, or has been speculating the whole time thinking this is over and all these poor cultists are going to end up in shit. Is to understand, and not just blindly belief, that *the stock is still heavily shorted, and this fact NEVER changed*. If we all understand this fact we *win*. The only potential source of this failing is our doubt amongst ourselves. I urge everyone to take a deep breath, and ask yourself: *Do you really belief that the HFs are truly out?* If the answer is no, than the best thing we can do is to recollect ourselves, regain the faith(which should not be blind faith but faith backed by reason) we had in each other and in this stonk, and HOLD AND BUY. 

TLDR
*Our whole reason of doubt is our own doubt. The entire thing is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If we all believe we win we win, if we all believe we lose we lose.(Yes this includes you bystander, we are all in this together) The fundamental reason the we believed GME is going to the moon has NEVER changed. HAVE FAITH that is BASED ON REASON. Blind belief is NOT solid, and can only get you so far*.
The stock is at a low, and this is a great opportunity if you sold earlier to get back in again. If we come together and have faith in reason, we have a greater chance than EVER to send this to the moon, wreck Wall Street, whatever you're in this for at the beginning.
*Unity and belief in reason, not fear, makes us strong*
*GME TO THE MOON BUY AND HOLD*

To rebuild faith in reason: 
-Welcome discourse, don't call everyone a bot
-Actively engage in discussions and focus on the fact that the stock is still heavily shorted as ever
-Spam less emojis, more rational discourse, appear more collected so people don't think we're a bunch of crazy cults sinking with the ship"|2021-02-02 17:09:36.920627|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170939.csv|DueDiligence|['GME', 'IS']|['GME']|['DD', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'AVILY', 'CAN', 'GME', 'NOT', 'NEVER', 'I', 'HOLD', 'AND', 'BUY', 'TLDR', 'GME', 'NEVER', 'HAVE', 'FAITH', 'BASED', 'ON', 'EASON', 'NOT', 'EVER', 'GME', 'TO', 'THE', 'MOON', 'BUY', 'AND']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

BUT THIS IS WHERE YOU LISTEN. To all the new investors that have just joined this sub over the last week and a half: Buy, the fucking, dip. It’s really that simple. So when I was eating crayons and having not fucking a groundhog five years ago, my novice dumbass investing brain thought you sold to save anything you had left - that was WRONG. Instead, when you buy more shares at a lower price, you LOWER YOUR COST BASIS.

What does this mean?

It means if you bought 10 shares of GME at $300 and then bought another 10 at $80, your cost basis is $190. Essentially, you’re not only lessening losses but you now have the potential to make even sweeter tendies. Now, when the price goes back up to $300 (which it will, because we are lubing that groundhog anus), you will now have a gain of $2,200.

I’m a former financial adviser that left the business back in 2012 because I was tired of the manipulation by large institutions. The game is rigged but understand the game if you are going to play.

What is GME worth- for all of you that like the stock. I think what you are saying is that you like video games, and the culture around gaming, and you want to support is a company that promotes those ideas. I can fully get behind that. And I can hope the GME management took the run up in stock price as an opportunity to bring some of your new capital in, and continue to restructure and develop a really amazing company around the future of gaming.

At some point though the price of GME stopped being about GME fundamentals or even a restructured growth story and started to be about a short squeeze. A very valid reason to buy the stock. Watching this all play out I noticed there was a point that short interest stopped going down. Institutions are sharks and will sell their grandmothers for a few dollars but many belong to larger entities that are not about to let a small trading arm take down their whole company. When the shorts stopped covering it wasn’t because they were continuing to hold onto their losing bet. But it was because they had already lost. The legal entities and their clearing houses holding these short positions were already theoretically bankrupt. It did not matter what the overnight borrowing costs to short the stock were and it didn’t matter what the price went to if the entity was bankrupt at $300, it is not More bankrupt at $400. You can be right about bankrupting some Wall Street institutions but still lose money if you are paying more for your trade than you will ever get back. My theory on the trading range over the past week is that some long side institutions said it wasn’t worth owning over a certain amount and were willing to buy at maybe $150 but wanted to sell at $300 (these numbers are theoretical). Bankruptcy payouts take a long time, and if your money is tied up waiting for a bankruptcy judge to approve who gets what money... well that can take years. Not ideal for portfolio returns.    Summed up there is some value that can be extracted from the shorts but that dollar amount is not infinite. There is an upper bound on the short squeeze price.
Also, and this is more speculation the longer this goes on the better Wall Street will be at extracting value out of the bankrupt institutions and shifting more risk to the bankrupt entities, and unwinding risk off of the other entities. If you are bankrupt you don’t borrow your last dollars from your credit card to put it on black, you put it on fucking 17 and hope the payout bails you out. And if you and your friend are both in trouble you talk your friend who is already bankrupt into borrowing a few more dollars (because no one can save him anyway) and “giving” you that money so you can get out debt.

Long-time lurker but decided to post because we need to keep this sub fun and bring positivity!

I've  truly enjoyed this sub over the last few years and at first I came for  the memes (guilty) but stayed for the community. As with most of the  world and especially the US life has been pretty challenging  over the  last year.  For me, that's meant an anxiety and depression cocktail  which not even my wife's boyfriend could help me get out of. I stopped  caring for myself and caring about anything really and although I keep  trying to do my best nothing had been able to get me out of this.

That  changed two weeks ago when my friend and I decided to go in on GME and  just see what happens. I went from checking this sub a few times a week  to pretending to read nearly every quality post and the excitement,  banding together, and support I have seen and felt over the last 2 weeks  have been amazing! It jolted me back into caring at least a little bit  about myself and life. It didn't solve the challenges I face but I feel  more alive than I have in over a year and it has helped me see I can get  out of the dark place I was in with some help and putting in a little  effort each day to change my behaviors.

I  appreciate all of you (Not you paper hands though) and please drink  water, exercise, try and eat healthy, and take time to disconnect once  and a while. Care for the people in your life and any strangers who are  not billionaire hedge fund managers or billionaire wealth hoarders.

WSB stocks have been rising and falling together for days now, even though they are very different stocks that people are in for very different reasons. This has the potential to create some bargains. I wanted to do a quick rundown for those who are unclear on why. The stocks I'm going to cover are GME, AMC, BB, NOK, and I'll touch on SLV (and why it's not a WSB stock)

**GME: The squeezening**

GME was trading at $4 a share 6 months ago. People on Wall Street were treating it like it would be the next Blockbuster. The fear was the people would buy their video games online and make the company obsolete. Hedge funds started heavily shorting it, expecting it to go bankrupt within a few years. Even if it was, 138% short interest is insane. They were asking for a squeeze. 

Also Gamestop is not that much worse positioned than any other brick and mortar retailer. The pandemic cost them in the short term, but they can survive. Is Macy's going out of business because of online shopping? Maybe eventually, but for now they're trudging along. Gamestop even has some advantages over other retailers, in that they can buy used games for pennies on the dollar and resell them for dimes on the dollar. If you do that with clothes you're a goodwill. In other words: **we like the stock**

There was really good news concerning vaccination, so the pandemic sell-off started reversing. As the stock price came back to pre-pandemic levels, Ryan Cohen joined the board (previous CEO of Chewy) there was hope for the future trajectory of the company. This absolutely screwed the short sellers, leading to the short squeeze. Gamestop has become a short squeeze play. It's speculative right now. It won't be worth $500 a year from now, and no one believes that. But it also won't be worth $4 a year from now. 

**AMC: GME's little brother**

AMC has a similar story to GME, except less hope. The cinema industry has been decimated by the pandemic, but that doesn't mean that the company is closing imminently. The company became undervalued, and with hope that the pandemic was coming to a close, the price started coming back to pre-pandemic levels. Short sellers got caught with their pants down. They got squoze, and lost a ton of money.

AMC is different that GME in that cinema's were having huge problems even before the pandemic. Also unlike GME, there is no e-business guru joining AMC's board. I think GME has hope long term, whereas I am much more skeptical for AMC. The short squeeze means that the stock will have crazy volatility in the short term, but long term I'm not sure where it ends up.

**BB: Not GME**

Blackberry is known for making cell phones for boomers, but they have shifted dramatically. At this point, Blackberry is a cybersecurity company:

https://marker.medium.com/how-blackberry-yes-that-blackberry-became-a-cybersecurity-company-efae02912751

BB is also interesting because they are really involved in the cybersecurity of self driving car technology:

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-software/blackberry-launches-cybersecurity-software-for-self-driving-cars-idUSKBN1F42LX

And with the solar winds hack, they were listed as a possible beneficiary. 

Blackberry has a partnership with Amazon, and has partnerships in China as well. BB is nothing like GME or AMC. It's a medium risk high reward stock that could hit $100 within 5 years or could do nothing. 

**NOK: Definitely not GME**

NOK is similar to BB in that people think of them for their phones, but they... don't do that anymore. NOK is a 5G company now. They have 2 major competitors in Europe, Ericsson and Huawei. Yes, that Huawei. The one that no one trusts because they are probably selling your data to China. It is likely that Huawei gets regulated out of Europe, which is a gift to Nokia. The company has partnerships with T-Mobile and Google:

https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/nokia-nok-secures-key-deals-145002461.html

Nokia is a low risk medium reward type of stock. It's trading at around $4.50 right now. I would be surprised if it didn't hit $5.50 by EOY. But I would be just as surprised if it hit $9. They look to be giving out a consistent dividend, which might bring some big pension accounts on board. 

**SLV: Not a WSB stock**

I think I saw 1 post on SLV here, and suddenly it is a WSB stock in the media. Someone posts here about SLV every once in a while, talking about silver to gold ratios or some shit. SLV is a scam. SLV does not create value. It's a commodity. Institutional investors are all over it. There's no law that says it has to have some ratio to gold. Literally the first law of the stock market is that past performance does not determine future results. 

Notice how SLV is the only stock out of all the ""WSB stocks"" that is not trending together. GME, BB, NOK, and AMC are wedded to each other even though they are obviously very different. SLV does it's own shit. I really think this SLV thing was just a way for some hedge fund to cover some sneaking shit they were pulling.

**ALL THAT SAID**

If GME or AMC crashes after the squeeze and that leads all the other ""WSB stocks"" to crash, BB and NOK present huge opportunities. I personally am going all in on NOK if it goes under $4 a share. 

**TL;DR**: GME and AMC are short term, high risk, high reward short squeeze plays. BB is a longer term, medium risk, high reward play. NOK is a longer term, low risk, medium reward play.

The game has changed.

Hedge funds seem to think that driving the price down is in their best interest, **it is not.** Here is why.

A short squeeze results from a low availability of shares. The price of the share does not necessarily matter for a short squeeze, and it does not effect the magnitude of an infinity squeeze.

Hedge funds need a lot of shares, and they do not want to buy them for a lot of money. They do, however, have a lot of money. Hedge funds believe that it is in their best interest to drive the price down and scare other out because they are way too over leveraged. **But the price decreasing is actually not in their best interest**

Driving the price down allows retail investors to maximize their ability to hold shares. Once the amount of free floating shares is too low, hedge funds panic much like the VW short squeeze. For the price of one share on Friday (~$330) you could have purchased 4 shares today (~$82). Hedge funds can outpace us when shares cost a lot of money, but we can fight back when they are cheap.

Furthermore, allowing hedge funds to drive the price down can trigger the short sell rule which restricts their ability to drive the price down further. Let them drive the price down, let them trigger that rule and then load up.

Slowly the resources will be out of reach for the hedge funds, and they will have no choice but to cover. That is when you get to name your price, everything in between is just for show.

I am not a financial advisor, nor a professional by any means. All information and discussion in this post is purely speculative and hypothetical. I am retarded. I own GME shares.

I found a great quote on [nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com) that summarizes how fucked the shorts are going to be.

""Here’s An Example Of How To Short A Stock

For example, let’s say ABC stock is currently trading at $10. After doing your research and due diligence (DD) you think that ABC stock could fall to $5 a share. You will then contact your broker, and your broker will lend you shares of ABC stock that you will then sell in the open market. In this example, let’s say you short 10 shares of stock. 

So, after selling those 10 borrowed shares of stock, you now have net positive $100 cash in your account. Next, ABC stock drops to $5 a share the following week. You will then do what’s called “cover your short position” by buying the stock back. In this case, you buy back at $5. Lastly, you will pay your lender back the shares you borrowed and profit the difference. So with 10 shares as the example, you, as the investor, would profit $50 shorting ABC stock from $10 to $5 a share. 

It’s crucial to note that, despite some investors having made their fortunes by short selling, it’s considered a high-risk investment strategy. The reason being is because short selling has infinite risk. In simpler terms, the amount you can lose by shorting a stock is unlimited.""

What we are seeing today is the HFs trying lower the price of GME in order to scare retail investors. They squeeze has not been squoze.

(insert a lot of rocket emojis, diamond hands and all that.)

I am a degenerate and this is no investment advice. Do your own DD and don't spam me. I increased my GME position today at 80$. But what do I know? I just buy GME and today it was cheeper than yesterday.

This was part of 6198 options already exchanged today and 19,261 contracts bought since Friday. 

iShares Global Clean Energy ETF is the largest clean energy ETF and has the most liquid options market of any of the ESG funds. Jan 2023 began trading last Monday, and July 2021 and Jan 2022 have also seen tens of thousands of contracts traded almost entirely at highest strike price available ($45) in recent days. 

Why? IMO These options are hella cheap with IV around 50% on an ETF that has QUADRUPLED (from low of $8) in past year with top holding (PLUG) up 1800%+ in past year. 

If ICLN “only” doubles to $60 in next year and IV reverts to historical mean of ~80%, $5.8 options @45 would be worth at least $20 with still a year left to expiry. 

And this $10M is really nothing compared to Trillions in capital already deployed by the US, China, and Europe as part of economic stimulus plans all centered around clean energy (the US joined this wave with Biden’s plan). TRILLIONS in direct subsidies in conjunction with TRILLIONS in quantitative easing by the Fed and other central banks. As just one example, PLUG has completed two secondary offerings in past few months to capitalize on stock price and raise billions to build 5 hydrogen plants, 2 operational next year. 

So in summary while the focus has been on GME etc in recent days, over 10 million dollars was quietly invested knowing TRILLIONS in Stimulus + TRILLIONS in Cheap Money could make for very nice returns."|2021-02-02 17:09:36.920627|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170942.csv|DueDiligence|['M']|[]|['I', 'ICLN', 'ETF', 'ETF', 'ESG', 'IMO', 'IV', 'ETF', 'UPLED', 'ICLN', 'IV', 'M', 'US', 'US', 'LIONS', 'LIONS', 'PLUG', 'GME', 'LIONS', 'LIONS']|['ICLN', 'ICLN', 'PLUG', 'GME']

Alright retards, listen up. Move your shares from your broker to direct registration. This puts the stock in YOUR name and not your brokerage (this is the electronic equivalent of a physical stock certificate).  
Meaning it will FORCE them to secure a REAL share. If our theories about the ladder attacks and naked shorts are true (significant counterfeit shares), the 
hedge funds will have a DEFINITE date that they will no longer be able to cover (3-21 days depending on how / when enough shares get moved over), even with the bullshit tricks up their sleeve. And when that happens.... fuck the moon, we're going to a new fucking dimension!

Someone tell me I'm wrong. Until then, fucking **HOLD**. 


**How to move your shares:**

It should be as simple as phoning up your brokerage and having them move the shares to DRS. They will have all the info needed as long as your account is up to date.

After that, you simply need to sign up with the registered transfer agent for GME, which is found here: https://news.gamestop.com/shareholder-services/investor-faqs

I contacted both Fidelity and the transfer agent (https://www-us.computershare.com/Investor/#Contact/Enquiry) and verified all of this. The transfer agent will offer the same trading services as a brokerage,
except they aren't pooling our shares together and you have COMPLETE control over how your share is used. This account would be only for GME. 


In reality once the % of float was moved over we'd start seeing the effects. I'm sure someone better at math than me could figure out the exact % needed.

Am retard. Not fin adviser. Additional DD on this subject in my profile.

Edit: 

More info on DRS ""DRS provides investors with an alternative to holding their securities in certificate or “street” form. Under DRS, investors can elect to have their securities registered directly on the issuer’s records in book-entry form. With DRS, the investor does not receive a physical certificate, instead receiving periodic account statements (at least yearly) from the transfer agent or issuer evidencing holdings. Dividend/interest payments, proxy materials, annual reports, etc., are mailed from the issuer or its transfer agent directly to the investor.""


Edit 2:

Big sad my fellow retards. While this plan would technically work (even somewhat validated by the fidelity equity rep I spoke with, he said they'd have to ""locate the shares"" first), I no longer think it is cost effective. The fidelity website page I saw for DRS transfers had them listed as free, but upon talking in more specific details with fidelity it would cost $100 PER SHARE to transfer. You literally cannot convince me that the system is not entirely rigged against the retail investor - we can't even truly own our fucking shares. I expect other brokerages are probably similar.

You really only have 3 options at this point:

1. Make money
2. Make a ton of money
3. Lose money

So how do these 3 come into play?

1. HOLD.  If you hold the shares you currently have, we will climb back up and you will have your tendies.  The squeeze is coming.  The hedgies are beyond fuk right now.  Hold, and sell at $10k.  This was always the plan and still is.
2. HOLD and AVERAGE DOWN.  You already know you're going to make money because the hedgies are fuk.  Want to make more?  Lower your cost basis!  If you bought in at $300, right now the stock is cheap as hell.  If you bought 10 @ $300, and buy another 20 @ $120, your cost basis has now dropped to $180.  In addition, you have now have 30 stocks in total, further fuk'ing the hedgies.  This is the smart play.  The people who will be driving Teslas to Valhalla dripping dip sauce all over themselves while eating tendies are doing this.
3. Be a paperhanded bitch and sell cuz you're scared.  You lose money and have no hope of profiting off the hedgies being fuk.  You lose a ton of karma and WSB calls you a poonanny for the rest of your life.  You will eventually see the massive amounts of profit everyone else takes and you will cry.  Your wife's boyfriend won't even let you smell his taint anymore.

The choice is yours.  I'm in it to further fuk hegdies, make tendies, and aspire to be DFV.  I'll take option 2."|2021-02-02 17:09:36.920627|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170939.csv|DueDiligence|['$GME']|['GME']|['I', 'WSB', 'HOLD', 'HOLD', 'ERAGE', 'DOWN', 'WSB', 'DFV']|[]

* the number of shares sold short (short interest) divided by average daily volume.
* This is often called the ""days-to-cover ratio"" because it determines, based on the stock's average trading volume, how many days it will take short sellers to cover their positions **IF THE PRICE GOES UP**

# EILI5

* a stock has a short interest of 4 shares
* average daily volume of shares traded is 20

# What is Short Selling?

&#x200B;

* Short selling is the opposite of buying stocks.
* It's the selling of a security that the seller does not own, done in the hope that the price will fall.
* You can borrow the stock from your broker-dealer, sell it and get the proceeds from the sale.
* **If the stock price declines, you can close out the position by buying the stock on the open market at the lower price and returning the stock to your broker. Since you paid less for the stock you returned to the broker than you received selling the originally borrowed stock, you realize a gain.**

What was the price of $GME last week? It was over $200, over $300, over $400 even...What is the price of $GME now ? $117 and as low as $74.

# If I opened a short position at $300, and closed it out at $74.22 the very bottom of the day.....maybe the price goes up a bit because lots of shorts closed for a profit....and sold to all of you who thought you were ""buying the dip""

Based on Reddit Logic, it's impossible for any other person or company to have shorted the stock after it went above $200. Of course they did, that is an absolutely ridiculous price. Everyone knows what happens AFTER a short squeeze...look at the VW chart. It's easy to understand that a $300 price of GME wouldn't last that long, so if you short it at $300...why would you close your positions now when it will continue to drop? More it drops more you make.

Just wanted to give you an update on the IFF Short and gamma squeeze opportunity I brought to WSB yesterday.

It is great news! The cost to borrow shares continues  rocket upwards (44.7%), and they continue to use borrowed shares to try and keep down the price.

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/IFF

There is a good options ladder this week (at $135 and $150), and there is a monstrous option gamma squeeze at $150 for Feb 19.

This is also a very valuable company, which will see significant growth in their price to sales multiple, now that their acquisition of DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences is complete.

Here is the Ortex data, showing the current number of borrowed (short) shares is at 61m:

Now I'm in pretty deep and been following the story relentlessly.

Robinhood replaced restrictions on the stock RIGHT AS THE SHORT LADDER ATTACKS STOPPED. They seem to only place restrictions on trade when it goes up, never when it plummets. They're trying everything to freeze the price or lower it at any cost to stop its momentum. Robinhood restricting last Thursday could've been a fluke in market manipulation since they were completely broke and literally couldn't afford to buy anymore stock. But THIS, THIS IS BLATANT MARKET MANIPULATION WITH NO ROOM FOR SPECULATION. They now have ample funding as seen in their stupid ass tweets and the correlation between NYSE stopping short ladder attacks and them placing a max cap on how many GME stocks can possibly buy is just TOO MUCH! They're doing everything in their power to stop this stock and it's actually scaring me a little. If they can pull this illegal crap with no punishment, I've completely lost faith in our free market. I've already filed a complaint to the SEC about this issue and I hope you guys do the same. This war is far from over.

(Edit): I know that exchanges freeze stocks not brokers. Robinhood is contributing to the price stagnation right now (a price freeze in my mind) by putting restrictions on how much you can buy yet again.

Since my last comments got buried, I figured I’d do my autists who haven’t gone full qanon a favor and paint you the bigger picture of how this shit will go down. It’s long so strap in kiddos. 


The squeeze is over. It’s happened. It happened on Wednesday into Thursday when it hit the intraday high of 483. This squeeze was when we fucked over Melvin to the tune of 50% of their portfolio who were shorting at a fucking ridiculous $3 entry. We did it. We won. 


Now where you retards went wrong is you failed to realize that there was a whole new flood of shorts at $400. This is why short interest (more on short interest later) stayed at roughly 60m shares short which is where you get your divine 110% short number. 


This is when all hell broke loose and wall st. did their usual fuck the retails and the poors tactic, and guess what. It worked. It went from intraday highs of $483 down into the 200s for a lot of Thursday and Friday. THIS IS WHEN THEY COVERED. Let’s get one thing straight. Wsb’s greatest advantage AND weakness is diamond handing. You either hold to become DFV or you hold to become the guy who lost 500k on luckin coffee. HFs don’t give a shit about diamond handing. They drool over .001% alpha on volume trading so no fucking shit they’re going to cover from 400 to 200. 


So now the short interest sits at roughly 50%, but probably closer to 30% when you take into account various hedges. It means these new shorts fucked you all to the tune of over 6b when they covered. Daily interest rates are a fucking joke when they’ve made their profits already. The remaining shares short are their yolos. 


Now here’s where you retards really fucked up. You keep expecting the same short squeeze potential when we first squoze. That pressure was legitimate as Melvin was sitting on shorts initiated at $3. Every move upwards fucked them hard. Anyone who’s held ITM options knows the joy of high delta. But you retards don’t realize that these new shorts are initiated at $400. HOW THE FUCK IS RETAIL GOING TO PUSH THIS TO 400 WITHOUT A SQUEEZE? The only reason it got there was the squeeze from the $3 short. Diamond handing at these levels does fucking zero. You fucks need to purchase at 400 - then push beyond that to 500-600 to put any sort of pressure on these new shorts. Diamond handing does literally NOTHING because they’re under no pressure besides laughable interest rates. 


In a way, it’s actually beautiful. You’re all holding OTM options with a delta of .005 with zero catalysts and zero hope for a squeeze. It’s wsb at its finest. At this point, aside from the automated ladder attacks, you’re all just bidding against each other and there’s not enough momentum to turn the tide. One last time for you dense motherfuckers out there - diamond handing does not pressure these new shorts. You need to buy to $350+ and then buy again at those levels. Buying dips does jack shit. 


Now, a quick primer on short interest. The only reliable info on short interest is the SEC report that comes out every 15 days. There are a stupid number of outlets reporting 15 day old (all melvin) figures. Which brings us to the slimy fucks at S3. Yes they have citron-like marketing, but it’s the only publicly available model for short interest. They showed that during wed/thurs, short interest was still at 110%. The problem was that you yards thought it was Melvin instead of the new shorts. They then updated again to show that short interest was now down to 50% levels or 30% if you take into the hedges I mentioned earlier. You can reeeeee all you want, and accuse them of being shills, but just take a look at this price action. Is it possible they’re lying out of their teeth? Sure. But It’s pretty fucking clear what is taking place so just fucking Occam’s razor it you tards. You’re all bagholding for “ideals” and “justice”. If you all want to sacrifice your money to these vampire fucks out of your unwavering sense of virtue, be my guest. Just post some loss porn for the rest of us.

Couple this with the ladder attacks, including today’s where it dropped to almost $80 at open and then popped up to $150.

Is it not possible that shorts have been covering during the short ladder bottoms and popping it back up (today’s especially) to cover and then re-shorting the stock to profit as it drops?

With the Democratic sweep, impending national cannabis legalization turbocharges this already sexy investment. More legal states = more cannabis retailers to list on Weedmaps = more revenue. Even better? I see a future where consumers buy their cannabis from local retailers in their state online via Weedmaps. The company is already profitable and has high brand equity with those who smoke the ganja. I posted about this SPAC around two months ago at $14 and it has since reached a peak of $26. At $20 where it currently stands, this a great time to jump in before the merge/ticker switches to $WEED. I see this stock reaching $50 before this Summer.

Aphria (**$APHA**) and Tilray (**$TLRY**) are merging to create the world’s biggest cannabis company. Close to 1B (874M to be exact) in annualized revenues which will only grow.

Anyways the merger states:

“Under the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Aphria (the “Aphria Shareholders”) **will receive 0.8381 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of Tilray for each Aphria common share** (each, an “Aphria Share”), while holders of Tilray shares (the “Tilray Stockholders”) will continue to hold their Tilray shares (the “Tilray Shares”) with no adjustment to their holdings. Upon the completion of the Arrangement, Aphria Shareholders will own approximately 62 percent of the outstanding Tilray Shares.” [Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201216005519/en/Aphria-and-Tilray-Combine-to-Create-Largest-Global-Cannabis-Company-With-Pro-Forma-Revenue-of-C874-Million-US685-Million)

This means Aphria should be trading at **.8381** of Tilray’s share price. Tilray is at $22.50 x .8381 = **$18.86**. Aphria should be trading at **$18.86**, yet it’s only at **$13.95.** That’s a whopping **34%** difference.

Considering Aphria is the stronger company and controls 62% of the combined company, it’s very rare for it to be trading so far away from the merger ratio. I’ve never seen a merger discrepancy like this before. If anything, Aphria should have the premium. Also, Tilray has high short interest so I doubt it will dip as shorts have to cover, it's most likely Aphria should catch up to Tilray's level.

**Aphria/Tilray vs. CGC**

Now let’s compare Aphria/Tilray to Canopy Growth. Canopy did 135M revenue last quarter which is approximately 540M annualized revenue along with a 96M net loss and a whopping adj. EBITDA loss of negative 85M. Furthermore, Canopy has -190M free cash flow, ([Source](https://www.canopygrowth.com/investors/news-releases/canopy-growth-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-2021-financial-results/))

Aphria did 160.5M revenue with Adj EBITDA of 12.6M. This will only increase as their next financials will have SweetWater Brewing on them. [Source](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/aphria-inc-announces-record-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2021-results-890905217.html)

Aphria expected to potentially be cash flow positive either this Q or next. “And we continue to work to be free cash flow positive in Q3, all subject to the intensity of COVID-19 restrictions in the markets where we operate. “

Canopy is valued at **15.8B USD**. Aphria/Tilray will be close to 1B annualized revenue, is EBITDA positive, and is valued at only 4.4 and 2.9B respectively. Not necessarily hating on CGC, the backing from Constellation is definitely solid, but when comparing the two Aphria should be valued higher.

Aphria leads Canada in market share ahead of CGC:  [Source](https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235)

Aphria also has a solid presence in the United States thanks to their EBITDA positive craft beer company, SweetWater who sells [cannabis-inspired beer](https://www.sweetwaterbrew.com/brews/420-strain-g13-ipa/).

Lastly, the U.S gov could act on some sort of cannabis legislature soon:

**TL;DR:** Aphria should be trading 34**% higher** than its current SP due to the .8381 merger ratio with Tilray.

If you are interested in cannabis, I believe there is much better value in Aphria/Tilray compared to CGC.

First – Monke Diamond Hands Banana Rocket Rocket Rocket Rocket Moon

**This is not financial advice. This is speculation based on my limited understanding of SEC rules and documents. Sources linked. Please read edits 2 & 3.**

**TLDR**: My opinion is that Shorts will continue to drive the price down with ladders and try to break the chain of consecutive days where GME is listed as a threshold security. **They need at least 1 non-Failure To Deliver day before EoD Thursday. If they get even 1 day without aggregate Failure To Deliver then the entire 13 consecutive day count restarts. They need 5 consecutive days without aggregate Failure To Deliver to have GME fully removed as a threshold security. Selling is good for them and bad for diamond hands. Ape strong together. Diamond Hands get the Rocket Ship.** No idea if achieving 13 consecutive days will force the squeeze or not.

My opinion is that Shorts don’t plan to cover their position by Tuesday. They don’t have to. Instead, they will drive the price down for as many days as possible and attempt to break the chain of consecutive settlement (read: business) days where they fail to deliver. GME has been listed as a **threshold security** (see below) for 10 consecutive business days (please check my math. I had to count on my fingers). Shorts need to break that chain before it reaches **13 consecutive business days**. “Participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in ‘threshold securities’ if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.” \[SEC Rule 204\] (link below)

**If diamond handed monke can HOLD strong and reach 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, then the shorts will have to cover the position by buying GME shares or equivalent shares of like kind and quantity. If maths good, that puts Thursday Feb 4th as day #13. Ape hold strong.**

We've seen confusion, fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding what happened Monday Feb 1st. Remember that FUD is one of their greatest weapons against retail investors right now. They want to use it to divide retail and to convince people to sell based on emotion. I’M NOT FUCKING SELLING!

Warning: I am not a financial professional or a financial advisor. I read at a grade-3 level. This is not financial advice.

\*Read below here if you can or care.

1. Why no squeeze Monday after $320+ close on Friday?

Shorts weren’t required to cover their positions on Monday. I think that they have T+2 (time of close + 2 business days) to cover their position. If true, this means they have until EoD Tuesday to cover. After that, they will have failed to deliver on the security. That isn’t good for them, but it isn’t as bad as it sounds. Failure to deliver is like a steppingstone in the process. After 5 consecutive business days with Failure To Deliver, the stock is listed as a security threshold. NYSE Threshold Securities can be checked here [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

It takes 13 consecutive days being listed as a security threshold before the positions must be closed (If the rules still apply to them).

So, instead of covering, shorts spent the day driving the price down to a more favorable position for them. They may have scared away some paper hands along the way too.

2. How does that help the shorts?

Lower price means it costs less to cover and the Shorts have more room to negotiate with other funds. A cheaper darkpool buyout is good for them. If they can lower it enough, covering becomes a non-issue compared to a full on squeeze.

Shorts want to avoid days where GME fails to deliver and they want to create non-Failure To Deliver days to break the chain of consecutive failures to deliver. This is easier for them if the price is lower.

3. So squeeze on Tuesday/Wednesday right?

I don’t think the squeeze happens Tuesday or Wednesday. I think the shorts are setting up the next part of their plan. I think if the squeeze happens this week, it happens because the shorts reach 13 consecutive days where they fail to deliver. This means diamond hands and limiting the number of cheap shares that shorts can buy after ladder attacks aka diamond hands.

4. We’ve heard this before. So what?

I agree with the idea that adding RC & friends to the board had a positive influence on the stock price. I don’t think that was the only thing happening when we saw price rise during mid-January. Going back to the idea of 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, we can refer to our NYSE tracker [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

Starting at the beginning of the year, we see that Jan 4th is the first day GME is marked as a threshold security. It stays listed as a threshold security through Jan 15th. Remember we don’t count weekends so the count resumes January 18th. On the 18th, it falls off the list for the day and comes back on January 19th. Without this single day drop-off, the 13-day countdown would have ended at EoD Wednesday Jan 20th. I believe that the price jump we saw can be partially attributed to the fact that shorts NEEDED to avoid another Failure To Deliver or they would risk being uncovered. That was pre-spike. Now they are in a similar position closing in on the 13th consecutive day. They will do whatever they can to avoid that 13th consecutive day because that means they will avoid having their record books searched through by someone outside their firm/fund.

**Threshold Securities**

Def: Threshold Securities are equity securities that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for

· Five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency; and

· Totaling 10,000 shares or more; and

· Equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer’s total shares outstanding.

If you see any mistakes or if I missed something, let me know. Looking to keep this as accurate and up to date as possible.

Conclusion: Hold banana with diamond hands to board the rocket ship

Edit 2: It has been brought to my attention that I didn't count Jan. 18th as a holiday when checking the threshold securities list. Going back to check my work now and will mark any edits that are made. Information will not be removed, but I will do my best to address any mistakes I have made. Thank you for your help.

Edit 3: Dec. 25th, Jan. 1st, and Jan 18th were all holidays and NYSE was closed. Going back we see Dec. 8th has GME listed as a security threshold. It was correctly pointed out ( u/AlexGu812 ) that this brings us to 37 consecutive days. I don't know enough about this stuff to confidently say what that means. I think it may have to do with the close-out requirements or it could be a sign of bad faith actions.   ""The requirement to close out fail to deliver positions in threshold securities that remain for thirteen consecutive settlement days does not apply to any positions that were established prior to the security becoming a threshold security"" <-- This may explain why we haven't seen mass closeouts despite passing the 13 day threshold.

I've posted on here a couple times before, I'm just interested in continuing to exchange quality plays to keep our tendies flowing. If you have any doubts, check out my last DD on $SRNE from a few weeks ago:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky63a8/srne\_to\_the\_moon\_again/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky63a8/srne_to_the_moon_again/)

Now, I know everyone is kinda busy right now with GME, AMC, BB, and the rest. However, if you do happen to be out of those names (or missed the ride and never got in), I have another stock that I would like to bring to your collective attention. Corsair Gaming (CRSR).

I've seen DD about this stock on here before, but it's been a little while and I feel like it deserves some more hype. For those who are not familiar, Corsair makes keyboards, headsets, and other peripherals for use in PC gaming and livestreaming, which is a rapidly growing market, especially in the wake of COVID-19 lockdowns.

Corsair IPO'd back in September, and they crushed their Q3 earnings report. Their quarterly revenue increased 60% year-over-year, and their net income was up **384%.**  They also released full-year guidance, and they expect to finish the year with $1.6B in revenue and $187M in EBITDA. These are huge numbers when you consider their market cap is only $3.4B! At this revenue level, they would only be trading 2X sales, which is not high at all considering the current market and the high-growth industry they operate in. It's also possible that they see a revenue boost due to the recent console cycle. This brought increased attention to gaming equipment, and generated a demand that other major players couldn't keep up with. If you wanted to buy the new PS5 at any point since it was released in November, odds are that you couldn't. I don't really have any data to back this point up, but in my personal opinion, that factor could have lead more people to invest in computer gaming in order to play the new next-gen games that were released with the new consoles.

Holiday shopping season + console cycle + low supply of competing hardware could equal a blowout quarterly report.

After the recent events with GameStop, I am surprised that this stock isn't getting more hype because its situation should be right up this sub's alley. Corsair has about 90 million shares outstanding, but most of those are owned by company insiders until the lockup period expires at the end of this month. Right now, the float is only 25 million shares, and half of that float is owned by institutions and another 2 million of those shares are sold short.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crsr/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crsr/institutional-holdings)

In other words, there are only about 10-15M shares available to freely trade on a daily basis. This low float means that this stock can be easily manipulated by the big players, but this scarcity also means that in the event of good news, this stock could fly. Even if enough people try to pile in before earnings, the price could jump $5-$10 like it did last Wednesday. 

Corsair is going to report their Q4 earnings on February 9th, and I think that leading into that report, they could move back into the $40 range. After their last earnings they ran from $21-$51, so another move over $50 is not out of the question. I still haven't figured out options, so I have no idea what strike price or expiration date you should be looking at, if any. I'm playing this the only way I know how, accumulating some shares while it's under $40 and holding 'till next week.

TLDR: High-growth gaming stock could crush earnings next Tuesday. Low float = high volatility, so any good news could shoot it up.

This is **NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**, please do your own research before entering into a trade. Simply presenting a trade that I’m excited about, and I’d love some feedback.

Now I may be a smooth-brained autist but it seems that TTCF is actually quite different from BYND and has a niche in that it offers other popular food shit like stuff with cauliflower flour substitutes as well as plant-based meat. Also, in case you didn’t know, Beyond Meat’s ingredients lists are longer than your wife’s boyfriend’s dick, and health-conscious people don’t like that. TTCF pushes a more “farm to table” notion that makes its products seem closer to the source, so it also differentiates itself from BYND that way. 

Last quarter's net income was shitty compared to previous quarters (loss of 3.1M for Sept 2020 compared to 916K and 4.88M for June and March 2020 respectively). They said that the major loss last quarter was due to a “non-recurring” expense, which is not unexpected considering these plant-based companies have a lot of innovative shit to deal with in order to scale and preserve food made from natural ingredients that naturally go bad. 

Another major thing to consider is their revenue last quarter compared to BYND: DESPITE THE FACT THAT TTCF HAS NEARLY 1/10 THE MARKET CAP OF BYND (1.65B compared to \~11B ), ITS REVENUE LAST QUARTER WAS ONLY ½ THAT OF BYND (41M compared to 94.44M). 

Also, given that unlike BYND the big institutions haven’t jumped on board for this one yet, there is solid room for growth. Their earnings will be at the end of the month or at the very beginning of March. The last earnings report moved the price up big time despite net loss and this upcoming one likely will too.

I hate to say it, but I think the jig is up and I'll show you my reasoning. In this document:

1. Melvin was telling the truth about covering their entire short position last week (.
2. Why the GME chart doesn't match the VW chart
3. If all the shorts have covered, then why are there no shares available to short?

# 1. Melvin Capital DID close their shorts last Monday

[Melvin Capital announced last Tuesday they closed their short positions](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/hedge-fund-targeted-by-reddit-board-melvin-capital-closed-out-of-gamestop-short-position-tuesday.html). There is more than enough evidence they accomplished this last Monday.

First, check out GME price action and volume last Monday (1/25). I want you to pay close attention to the period between 10am and 11am.

[GME price action and volume on 1\/25](https://preview.redd.it/vn98pna6p3f61.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=73b9000a233bd0a522fa6d25c68ea4025bbecc92)

Now take a [Look at Melvin Capital's last reported holdings](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link). From what I can tell, it looks like Melvin liquidated a percentage of their positions across the board. I chose to sort this chart by % Ownership with the thinking that selling a stock for which you have high ownership is sort of a reverse squeeze (you create a large amount of float in comparison).

For their top owned holding (8.7% of shares owned)  **L Brands** (ticker LB), notice the price action on 1/25. They liquidated their holdings from \~10am-11am, which coincides directly with the jump in GME price.

[LB Brands price and volume action on 1\/25](https://preview.redd.it/e99gwq6io3f61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e3b9f78b6892dfadf936a087398917f9d1865e0)

Furthermore, we can get a very rough estimate at how much Melvin raised to cover their GME shorts. From [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/LB:NYSE) we can see LB volume on 1/25 was 17M shares. If we look across the previous 4 Mondays, the average volume on a Monday is <3M shares. It's likely that when Melvin offloaded their shares, they caused stop losses to trigger and unintentionally caused others to sell their shares, but if we assume Melvin raised the cash from all the sales, they made \~$200M from LB sales alone.

Here's another holding (7.2% Ownership) American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) with the same price and volume action. The volume on 1/25 was 13M vs 3-5M for previous Mondays. Using the same napkin math as above, we get \~$200M netted above average volume.

Extrapolating this across their 119 holdings they could easily have raised the capital required to close at least most of their GME position. Although there is no data on their short position, assuming it was 10x their reported position in GME puts (50M), they could have easily covered the position in trading volume that day (178M)

[American Eagle Outfitters price and volume action for 1\/25](https://preview.redd.it/h75olhmgr3f61.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=0390813919218e2cd528b6737df9bf576f00a22f)

Although I checked for quite a few of their holdings and saw the same pattern, I'm a retard when it comes to making these graphs and I'll leave it as an exercise to further validate.

# 2. Why isn't GME going to rebound like VW?

Most of you have likely seen the below graph used to describe the VW squeeze in 2008. One of the most notable parts about the graph is the massive drop in VW price right before the squeeze - why did that happen?

[Volkswagen AG share price during 2008 short squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/kgnshh3os3f61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdfcad33bff94490b2b0301e13befa602b854673)

[This is a great article I found gives a mostly objective view on the VW short squeeze](https://www.ft.com/content/0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39a26) and I think /u/notasabretooth gives a good explanation [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l624yc/why_did_vw_dip_before_the_big_squeeze_in_08/gkxu360?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) The great financial crisis crashed markets globally and VW followed suite - in fact, when VW stock began to fall, short sellers doubled down on their bets as VW was not in great financial shape which caused the very noticeable down spike in the graph above. Porsche had other plans, however, and announced to the world that it had stealthily accumulated shares and now \~90% of VW stock was out of circulation. This caused the sharp uptick and I would point out that there are no further rebounds following the initial squeeze.

Although GME still has many shorts, many of these shorts are likely not the ones that started before the squeeze and instead sold near the top with a much better cost basis. In fact, one of my subscribed newsletters sent out the below sage advice 4 days ago - and if I was smarter I would have listened :)

>""GME is one of the greatest shorts of all time. If you can get the borrow… short it he told me. ""

# 3. If all the major shorts have covered, then why are there no shares available to short?

This was another thing that had not been sitting well with me. If there are no shares available to short sell, then how has the number of shorts decreased? 

First, touching on above - the current short sellers likely have a much higher cost basis and are unlikely to be squeezed like those caught in the initial squeeze. 

Second, it's not clear how shares are made available for borrowing. I found [this very informative article](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investor-education/can-my-broker-lend-out-my-shares-to-short-sellers-without-asking/article32393872/) which gives the meaningful lines of text

>If you want to short sell a stock, your broker needs to call his or her firm's loan desk to see if the shares are available for lending... If the firm does not own it in their own portfolio they have to attempt to borrow the stock from other firms.  As a client of a firm, **your shares cannot be lent out to someone who is looking to short sell**. Shares are held in trust for each client and are kept on separate books. 

If this is true, then the GME squeeze was likely a victim of its own success. By retail investors buying all the stocks, we prevented a continuous short squeeze by evaporating the supply of shortable shares."|2021-02-02 20:42:41.183949|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_204247.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'VW', 'DID', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'L', 'GME', 'LB', 'GME', 'LB', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'LB', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'VW', 'VW', 'VW', 'AG', 'I', 'VW', 'I', 'VW', 'VW', 'VW', 'VW', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'LB', 'GME', 'LB', 'LB', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Sources in comments.

tl;dr: Given current situation and positive changes implemented by the management team I see $*MACE* having a great future (personal safety and security industry is projected to reach USD 5,5kkk by the end of 2025, registering annual CAGR of 11.00%. Growth is fueled by political changes, worsening climate situation and changes in human behavior). This is one is to hold for long time. I’m not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice.

Longer Version

My investment strategy is finding a stock that will perform well in medium/long term. I usually try to take profits or cut losses within one year, so look for companies that should benefit from what is happening around the world (be it Covid, civil unrests, green revolution, semiconductors scarcity). Today I’ll share my opinion about personal safety and security industry in light of current events.

Guns in USA – Democrats have control, RNA went bankrupt, society at large agrees on stricter gun laws. In near future this might result in policy changes that makes it more difficult for people to get lethal weapons as means of self defense. However, a need for self defense is not going away any time soon and here’s why:

· We have seen that during the recent civil unrest weapons and ammunitions sales skyrocketed. I think that fundamental issues which fueled these events are not going away anytime soon. Portland still rumbling in protests and Q is searching for space lasers… People will want to protect themselves – pepper spray or stun gun is better than nothing if gun laws change.

· Covid lockdowns and restrictions pushed people to spend more alone in the nature. You know who else is in the nature? Bears! Demand in animal deterrent sprays should increase.

· All the talks about defunding and rebuilding police. Sounds like there is a room to expand use of non-lethal weapons in most situations.

· Dating world. Online dating accounts for most dates out there and that introduces risk of meeting some creepy person. Demand for personal safety alarms should increase. Good LinkedIn post on this: **Source 1**

· Climate change creates a lot of wealth disparity that fuels societal disorder. Throw on top of that explosive mix of economical, Covid, political issues and in my opinion what we are seeing now around the world is just the beginning of new normal. Critical mass of anger is achieved and this won’t go down so smoothly. When there’s anger on the streets people look to defend themselves.

In my opinion all of these are external catalysts for personal safety industry. Now about $*MACE*, one of the old timers in this industry.

**Company**: Mace Security International, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells personal defense and security products to retailers, distributors, and individual consumers worldwide. Brands: Mace, Tornado, Vigilant and Take Down. The company distributes and supports its branded products and services through mass market retailers, wholesale distributors, independent dealers, e-commerce channels, and installation service providers. Headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. [https://www.mace.com/](https://www.mace.com/)

**History:** Founded in 1965, but it looks like company has lost its way at some point – $*MACE* had carwashes as their line of business up till 2013 (**Source 2**). Old management team neglected company’s online presence, so brand and sales suffered. Not much else to say here.

**Now**: new management team since 2019. Has been working on changes and got struck with Covid shenanigans, but is adapting quickly to a current environment. Recognizes missed online opportunities and now is focusing on online sales. Q3 increase in online sales compared to Q2 is in triple digits (meaning 100%+) (**Source 3**, **Source 4**)

Check out their amazon shop – has lots of positive reviews.

When searching for ‘best pepper spray’, ‘best animal deterrent’ I find articles, posts with Mace products. That leads me to think that online exposure has improved a lot and there will be large number of people getting same results when looking for self-defense products.

**Latest Financial Results**: Q3 2020

Net sales increased $2,310,000 or 94% versus prior year, primarily driven by organic growth, addition of new customers both in retail and e-commerce segments and new product line extensions at retailers.  
Gross profit for the third quarter increased by $1,016,000 or 108% over the same period in the prior year, driven primarily by increased sales volume, labor efficiencies, and higher margin digital sales.  
SG&A expenses increased by $177,000 to $1,183,000 for the quarter, or 25% of net sales, driven primarily by higher variable sales commissions and performance-related incentives. Net income increased by $843,000.  
Cash and cash equivalents increased to $549,000 as of September 30, 2020, an increase of $242,000 over the $307,000 on hand on December 31, 2019. Working capital increased by $1,860,000 compared to December 31, 2019. The company paid off its loan in the amount of $600,000 on September 30, 2020.  
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $889,000 (1.4 cents per share on an undiluted basis for the quarter).  
From earnings call transcript: **Source 5** (I recommend to go through it – gives nice outlook on new management team results and their future plans)

**Recent Catalyst**: Protest in US and increased demand in personal defense products, 94% revenue increase in Q3 vs last year, ‘2021 OTCQX Best 50‘ award (**Source 6**), one-year $2.0 million Revolving Credit Agreement with Fifth Third Bank (meaning cash on tap: **Source 7**)

**Upcoming $*****MACE*** **Catalysts**: New product launch in Q1 2021 (mentioned in call transcript above), FY 2020 results (which due to all recent political tensions should show even better results than those reported for Q2 and Q3)

**Upcoming Industry Catalysts**: Personal safety and security industry is projected to reach USD 5,5kkk by the end of 2025, registering annual CAGR of 11.00%:

$*MACE* just touched 5 months bottom resistance point. In January after Capitol riots stock soared due to the whole industry (guns, ammo, self-defense) gains. I think that end of the month drop-off is due to people taking gains from speculation on January events.

Summary: I don’t expect here SPAC or pharma level returns, but steady growth instead. Would like to see $*MACE* trade in $1.5-$2 by Q3 and consolidate there by the end of year. It also used to pay dividends, but that has stopped in 2011. Who know maybe good results will reward investors with some dividends? :)

My position: 3.3k shares at $0.412

All of us have been feeling the ups and downs of this ride and, to be honest, don't forget where it all started and how far we've come. And by 'we' I mean the people who like this stock.

Big hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time).

But, just in time of Mark's Cuban AMA, I will spoil the message in his own words:

«If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.»

This is the message, this is what I want to say to every single of you retards who are in doubt. It's not all fun and games. Some suits are fighting not to lose billions. We, the people, are disrupting the market. You thought it would be easy?

They are doing everything they can to get those shares in your pocket, that's the only way to cover their naked ass. When people have been saying to **HOLD** this is precisely what they fucking meant. **TO FUCKING HOLD**. **THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD. NO, IF YOU WANT THOSE FUCKING TENDIES YOU CAN'T LET SOME WALL STREET CORRUPT TRASH PARASITE TO COME AND TAKE IT FROM YOUR HANDS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT HOLDING THEIR PANTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL AFRAID AND SELL. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD - AND ARE - FUCKING DESPERATE.**

You genuinely think that if they weren't scared all of this circus would've happen?

Hold your shares, and, if you can, buy some more. Volume is low, price is in discount. We still have the cheese in our hands. Plus (and correct me if I'm wrong because, you know, I'm a retard as well) they still have contracts to cover. I'm confident we might see the price to rise again today. But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, **patience is key.** Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): ***«Patience. Disruption is never easy or straight line».***

Guys, one last word: this is the epic journey people have been speaking for months. It's starting to spike (remember VW chart, i.e.). Today we are experiencing one of their last attempts to buy shares from the ones who panicked. This is why people keep yelling to **HOLD!** This is why you should not invest with money you might need, because you don't know how much time you'll have to **HOLD!** This is why you have to know your risk tolerance, to **FUCKING KEEP HOLDING**.

**JUST TAKE A LOOK TO THE MESIAH IT SELF, DO YOU SEE DEEP FUCKING VALUE SELLING?**

MAN UP BOYS, AND KEEP HOLDING THE FUCKING LINE

GME Is currently valued at 7.94Bn USD

The gaming industry was valued at 151Bn in 2019 according to grand view research. 

GME made 6.3 Bn in revenue last year with no new consoles to sell. 

Now let’s compare this to Chewy. (You all know about Ryan Cohen). 

Chewy is currently worth 41.76Bn!!!!

The pet care market according to the same analyst is about 150.72Bn in 2019. (Was 131 in 2016 with a CAGR at 4.6%)

Chewy had a revenue of 6Bn last year. 

So what does this mean?????????

GME is fairly valued at 41Bn if not more. 

That translates to 591.92$ a share.

I don't know what the fuck I'm doing but here's my Ding Dong:

* ICLN debuted in 2008 with the highest price of 60$/share during the time of oil fear but quickly got dumped back down over several years. The stock is currently trading at around 30$, only half from the peak.

[ICLN Timeline](https://preview.redd.it/5g9sw9hf14f61.png?width=1224&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ec7ca2c10425c1a5de851872324fa0fe898c8e6)

* **But here's the catch**. Back in 2008, the renewable energy industry was literal trash. The technologies at the time were expensive and inefficient. Miniscule progress was made even with huge subsidies from many countries. Fast forward 12+ years and with improvement in technologies, prices for renewable energy have been significantly reduced -> more adoptions from the average households.

[Prices for various renewable energies](https://preview.redd.it/0um3rmoj14f61.jpg?width=959&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08b89572ee4e2530ab5bbd396175a73d1eab8d26)

* Many companies in the industry are quickly growing in size and turning profitable. Amongst ICLN's holdings, there are: Enphase Energy $ENPH (which doubled in size from 2018-2019), Verbund AG (largest hydropower provider in Austria), big solar players like First Solar $FSLR, SolarEdge $SEDG, Sunrun $RUN, and some other foreign companies.

* Biden's Green Energy policies include plans to move the United States to 100% clean energy by 2050, boost jobs in the renewable energy industry, and up to $5 TRILLION incentives over the next 10 years. [https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/](https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/)
* Search results for 'clean energy' on the rise worldwide according to Google Trend.

* Premiums still cheap as fuck with 2023 call options only around $500-800$.

I will be holding this position for at least a year and will be adding more on major dips. I will also update this position monthly to the sub. Join me on this crusade for a brighter, greener, and richer future. This shit literally can't go tits up.

I eat yellow snow. Proceed at your own risk. 

***Of course hold GME*** but it's always a good idea to stay aware of other things that are going on.\*

I am a simple man. I will make a simple case for EXPI. 

1- If any industry is primed for disruption it is real estate brokerages. Information is becoming more and more available. Who the fuck wants to keep paying 6% commission so some college drop out can unlock a door and read some info off of a sheet? Nobody. Real estate agents can go get in the go fuck yourself line right behind the investment firms. We don't need them anymore. It's not 1985 anymore. 

2- Lets look at EXPI and how it's financials compare to two of its peers. Redfin and Zillow.

# Market Caps

Expi- 8.4b

RDFN- 8.2b

Z- 34b

# Net income

Expi- Profitable

RDFN- Not profitable

Z- Not profitable

# Revenue

RDFN's has half the revenue of EXPI

Z has slightly less then double the revenue of expi

# Simpleton's Math

Redfin has half the revenue and is not profitable and yet it has the same market cap as expi.

Z has 4x expi's market cap but only 2x the revenue. And its not profitable.

Even a dumbass like me can see that expi is trading way below the value of it's peers. A fair market cap would be around 16b which would put the stock price around $240. It's currently trading at $120

Here's my shitty DD, take it with a ton of salt cause I actually, truly have no idea what I'm talking about

&#x200B;

**Thesis:** 

This Friday and next Monday/Tues is going to experience the drop of all drops for GME due to expiring options being HEAVILY skewed towards puts

&#x200B;

Looking at the yahoo options chain ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME&straddle=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME&straddle=true)) and we end the week around the current price (say, $107):

&#x200B;

Total calls expiring ITM (strike price <= 105) : 16,337

Total puts expiring ITM (strike price >= 110) : 25,797

Net difference : 9460 more put contracts expire ITM, leading to an added **946,000 shares worth of selling pressure** 

On top of this selling pressure, similar to the gamma squeeze we saw on the way up with MMs buying shares as prices increase to cover the calls they wrote, **they will be selling shares as prices drop** to cover/hedge puts they wrote which are now ITM

&#x200B;

I have no idea if this makes sense

Realistically we can probably get $35,000 a share on average. This would put GameStop roughly around the same market cap as Apple. It could go up to $50,000 a share. Anything is possible.

I'm writing this to talk about GME objectively, not that ""to the moon""  or ""10k isn't a meme"" bullshit or some stupid misplaced crusade against wall street. I'm here to make money.

Right now GME has $586M in CACE ($140M of which is restricted so really $446M to do whatever they want with). Their assets have shrunk most notably from writing down almost $2 BILLION in goodwill over the last couple years. Right now the company has ZERO in goodwill, basically saying it's brand is worthless. I disagree with this after the hype WSB has created for this company. On the liability side, as of Q320, they have $224M and $216M in s-t and l-t debt, respectively, for total debt of $450M.

**GME PLEASE ISSUE STOCK.**

I know it will dilute the shit out of SHs and drop the price but I think it would be a huge buying opportunity. The fact that they haven't already is incomprehensible and arguably negligent. They could've issued 4-5M shares when this thing was over $300 at $200-250/sh and brought in $1B cash. But that's irrelevant now. What they could do is still issue stock, I'm not sure what price they could get for it but I'd be a buyer. Let's say they issue 5M shares at $100/sh, that's $500M cash... $500M would be HUGE in transforming the business. Up that to 10M shares and they bring in $1B. I think $1B is > than $500M but I'm wetahded.

So I titled this ""WSB POTENTIAL FOR ACTIVISM IN GME?"" because collectively we own a shitload of shares. Could we not push for the company to issue stock here? Could we not send a letter to GME like HFs do but with **🚀**🦍🌈🐻💎🙌🏽.

They could use $250M to pay down debt and the other half to really catalyze the transformation.

Video gaming is a growth industry and yes, brick and mortar is slowing dying, but as DFV said in his original thesis, that's a long way off.

GME needs to use the hype that WSB CULTIVATED for its brand and capitalize on it. The company couldn't have asked for a better xmas present than what's happening now. People are buying fucking billboards for GME. The company could be to gaming, what Chewy (a >$40B market cap) is to the pet industry. And clearly Ryan Cohen feels this way, too. GME needs to entrench itself into the gamer lifestyle and I really think raising funds now would accelerate this.

**Financials**

Right now I'm estimating GME will make $5B in revenues in 2020, so we're trading at 1.4x depressed revenues. For comparison CHWY trades at \~6x revenue, per yahoo finance. This is a company that made >$8B in 2018 and 2017.

They recently reported holiday sales (Nov and Dec) of $1.7B, down 1.9% yoy with 11% less stores open. SSS comps +4.8% yoy. But here's the most positive, digital sales were +309% yoy, and $1.35B ytd. As digital sales grow, this should help alleviate SG&A expenses which have historically crushed profitability. In 2017, 2018, and 2019 SG&A was $2B, and for 2020 it's looking like it'll be \~$1.4-1.5B.

**Valuation**

This is a very basic back-of-envelope calculation. But if GME can return to \~$8B in revenues (which is entirely possible and reasonable IF they can execute). And maintains historic GM's of \~30%, we get $2.4B in gross profit. And if digital sales continue to make up a larger chunks of revenues and they close redundant stores, they should be able to keep that SG&A expense under $2B. Let's say they can get it to $1.6B, which is about $100-150M above what SG&A will probably be this year (accounting for store reopenings).

So $8B revenues, 30% GM, $2.4B gross profit, $1.6B SG&A = $800M in operating income.

Assuming \~30% tax rate => $560M in net income.

If this plays out, we're currently trading at \~12.9x ($7.2B/$560M) what could be a reasonable net income # in the next couple years. My point is that GME might not be as overvalued as people think...

Anyways, please call me out on any bullshit in my thinking/logic."|2021-02-02 17:09:36.920627|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170942.csv|DueDiligence|['WSB', 'NTIAL', 'FOR', 'IVISM', 'IN', 'GME']|['GME']|['I', 'GME', 'B', 'GME', 'GME', 'M', 'CACE', 'M', 'M', 'LLION', 'ZERO', 'I', 'WSB', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'GME', 'LEASE', 'ISSUE', 'STOCK', 'I', 'I', 'M', 'B', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'HUGE', 'M', 'B', 'I', 'B', 'M', 'I', 'WSB', 'NTIAL', 'FOR', 'IVISM', 'IN', 'GME', 'GME', 'M', 'DFV', 'GME', 'WSB', 'VATED', 'GME', 'B', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'B', 'CHWY', 'B', 'B', 'SSS', 'B', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'GME', 'B', 'IF', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'M', 'A', 'B', 'GM', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'M', 'M', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'SSS', 'GME', 'GM', 'GME']

I tuned into Mark Cuban’s AMA and got wood at him saying hold if you can afford to. 

That all being, if the short interest truly is 36%, what is left of the original play toward a gamma squeeze. The only reason this play was ever a play to begin with was because of the 120%+ short interest GME originally had.

Once you become a stockholder and are able to vote on things, that info gained from such meetings and votes is what is considered to be insider information and if a stockholder sells due to such information being given to them legally, is an illegal action as it is not the true reason behind why one should buy a stock.

What is that one true reason behind buying a stock? It’s that you LIKE the stock. You LIKE the company. You LIKE that industry, and specifically that company within it.

People who buy a stock to just profit off of it in a short term, or to just profit off of the company’s bankruptcy, is a poor excuse of a human as they are wanting others to lose their jobs. Buying a piece of a company is/should only be for those who want to see the company do well, or enjoy the products and services offered by such company."|2021-02-02 17:09:36.920627|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170941.csv|DueDiligence|['$GME']|['GME']|['$GME', '$GME', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'DFV', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'DFV', 'DD', 'I', 'GME', 'LIKE', 'LIKE', 'LIKE']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Mad about what happened today and trying to recoup losses into and then some throughout the rest of the year? I might have a play for you that could 4x your current investment. I consider myself in a lot of ways to be an investor that spends a lot of time research high-growth stocks that have a clear market fit/product that will grow into the future. I was actually an early investor in NIO at $12 a share and sold around the $55 dollar mark with 4x profits. I like NIO, but I feel that the general EV market is in a bubble considering we are still years and years away from EV adoption in all cars. If you asked the EV manufacturers to supply the entire American public with EV cars and infrastructure - it would be impossible as they cannot scale and produce that rapidly. With NIO in particular - I mainly sold because I see the renewable energy stocks to have a more promising future in 2021 than EV cars since it's going to take them time to scale, and I don't expect them to repeat the same success in 2021.

Where did I put that profit? I put it right into GEVO as I believe BioFuels are the most sensible short-medium term solution for the world we live in. I am not crazy how GEVOs revenue numbers have been in the last few years, but I'm going to let that slide because of environmental/political factors that will sure to make it a major player in the future. On top of that, Biden elected the former co-founder of GEVO into his science cabinet which only increases my confidence. Right now, GEVO has $500M+ in cash on hand, zero debt, and over a billion dollars worth in potential contract value.

If you've been following the news - you would see how the big oil companies are growing concerned regarding regulations on the new administration - as even they see the writing on the wall. What I predict is, GEVO has the renewable patent technology they could license to these oil companies. Big Oil will partner with proven technologies before trying to re-invent the wheel (look at what happened with FCEL and Exxon). Big Oils conversion to clean energy is going to need to happen - and I'm expecting GEVO to land some partners soon.

I am currently holding 1600 shares at a cost average in the high 9s and feel that GEVO on the low end is $30 by end of year, and $60-70 on the high end. I think a lot of partnerships will start popping up soon and new adoptions in the green energy space by the Biden administration will cause this to really pop.

As many in the #BANG GANG have always known, $BB becoming a meme stock has been a **mixed** blessing, to say the least. to say the most, it's fucking sucked.

Look at this chart. Look at this fucking chart. I don’t need to run a regression, let’s be just as retarded as all the candle-stick reading dipshits with a Bloomberg terminal (*#Ben Graham GANG# FOREVER AND ALWAYS)* \- Look at the lines, and how they’re moving together. Try to wrinkle that smooth brain of yours for a second.

**Why THE FUCK would an (a) Endpoint / digital security company, a vidya retailer (yeah, sure they sell funko pops too now great ), a movie chain (half of you morons have 3 streaming subscriptions and last I checked you’re not allowed to watch in your underwear while getting tendie crumbs everywhere @ AMC), and some Fininsh 5(g) provider (I don’t know a fucking thing about NOK) move in tandem other than just being meme stocks on this fucking board?**

By the way - There's been a ton of great technical analysis posted on the others in $BANG. the short squeeze on GME was real and a once-in-a-lifetime catch and i respect the hell out of it (and am also a sad bagholder of a few shares). It's just that the reasons for liking each of the stocks is different.

For better or worse - There was a post, I can’t find it but somebody else can, that showed the Robinhood dashboard that basically said the three most commonly held shares in any given account was, you guessed it $BB, $AMC, and $GGME.

As you know, Mark Cuban took a break from his busy calendar of being the least retarded Sharktank (No offense Daymond John, I have a soft spot for FUBU but my wife’s boyfriend no longer lets me rock it) and touching tips with Luka Doncic to [answer some questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey_everyone_its_mark_cuban_jumping_on_to_do_an/). Somebody asked why $GME was taking a nose dive off of Mt. Everest. Per Cuban -

*Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.*

*Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.*

So. Two things re: $BB’s volatility.

# #1 Stopping buys (but allowing sales) tanked $BB, just like it tanked the other meme stocks. The tin foil apes can keep hawking about citadel etc. but the truth is likely that RObinhood is a tech-focused firm with shitty financial controls and even shittier risk management (GUH). Never ascribe to malice what is usually (and always with that shitshow of an excuse of a company) incompetence. Those dumbasses had a liquidity problem and solved it in the worst way possible. I hope their IPO fails and Vlad steps on a lego.

# #2. The current free fall of $GME / $AMC is still dragging $BB down. Why? What happens when people get margin called? Their entire account sells off some or all of a portion to satisfy the account. For those of you more discerning retards you know that the same thing happened to the hedge funds last week.

**It’s called** [**degrossing**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-30/a-reddit-army-descends-on-hedge-funds-chained-by-risk-models?sref=NJllTNWZ)**,** and is what caused the broader market to perform **inversely** to $BANG.

*BTW - It was really fantastic for me to watch my MSFT calls get fucked because of the morons of this sub. Satya Nadella daddy dicked earnings and the stock (along with the whole fucking market) was down…Live by the retard, die by the retard. But look at the bounceback this this week, when all the hedge funds looked around and said – Wait, J. Powell is still printing money like Zimbabwe and stocks only go up.*

***What do you think will happen once things calm down, the stimulus checks hit, and retail investors start looking around again for stocks they might like?***

So now what? Well, I REPEAT, **wrinkle that smooth brain of yours. What does #1 and #2 have to do with the** [actual reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4ehan/blackberry_dd/) **that #BANG GANG likes $BB?**

If you said – ""Huh, not much"" then congrats you’ve evolved slightly beyond a retarded monkey playing at a slot machine and shitting out sub-par memes.

**TLDR - $BB WENT DOWN TODAY BECAUSE OF FACTORS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO ITS STATUS AS A MEME STOCK. $BB $BANG GANG EATs WILD DAILY PRICE SWINGS FOR BREAKFAST. THE BIGGEST LESSON OF GME / AMC IS THAT RETARDS TOGETHER STRONG. ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT ENOUGH RETARDS BELIEVE, IT EVEN HAS A CHANCE TO ROCKET AGAIN IN THE SHORT TERM.**

**TLDR the TLDR - $BB #BANG GANG IS IN FOR THE LONG HAUL. WE’RE TERRAFORMING MARS, AND TAKING MATT DAMON WITH US.**

POS – balls deep in $BB shares, planning to buy more today

If you look here on [NYSE website](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse-arca/notices)

click the 'short sale restriction list' you will see a bunch of spreadsheets with stocks including GME.

Because I have a brain as smooth as an F1 car, this means that as of the 3rd of February 2021 (tomorrow),  **~~GME will no longer be under the threat of a short ladder attack~~****.**

A direct link to the spreadsheet which includes GME is linked [here](ftp://ftp.nyxdata.com/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_2021/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_202102/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers20210201.xls)

**But why?**

**There is a naughty list for stocks that have been fucked due to shorts**

Directly quoting [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thresholdlist.asp),

A threshold list, also known as a Regulation SHO Threshold Security List, is a list of securities whose transactions failed to clear during the previous trading days. Threshold lists are published in accordance with regulations set out by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Regulators review this information as part of their efforts to detect **market manipulation**.

* A threshold list is a list of securities that failed to settle in the previous five trading days.
* They are published by various exchanges in accordance with SEC regulations.
* These settlement failures may be indicative of naked short selling, although they may also be caused by benign factors, such as administrative errors.""

Also, if you read on the official [SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#:~:text=Rule%20204%20%E2%80%93%20Close%2Dout%20Requirement,of%20like%20kind%20and%20quantity), 

"" 

* *Rule 204 – Close-out Requirement*. Rule 204 requires brokers and dealers that are participants of a registered clearing agency[\[8\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn8) to take action to close out failure to deliver positions. Closing out requires the broker or dealer to purchase or borrow securities of like kind and quantity. The participant must close out a failure to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+4. If a participant has a failure to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona fide market making activities, the participant must close out the failure to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. If the position is not closed out, the broker or dealer and any broker or dealer for which it clears transactions (for example, an introducing broker)[\[9\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn9) may not effect further short sales in that security without borrowing or entering into a bona fide agreement to borrow the security (known as the “pre-borrowing” requirement) until the broker or dealer purchases shares to close out the position and the purchase clears and settles. In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out failures to deliver in securities with large and persistent failures to deliver, referred to as “threshold securities,” if the failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.[\[10\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn10) Threshold securities are equity securities[\[11\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn11) that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency (e.g., National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)); totaling 10,000 shares or more; and equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer's total shares outstanding. As provided in Rule 203 of Regulation SHO, threshold securities are included on a list disseminated by a self-regulatory organization (“SRO”). Although as a result of compliance with Rule 204, generally a participant’s fail to deliver positions will not remain for 13 consecutive settlement days, if, for whatever reason, a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency in a threshold security for 13 consecutive settlement days, the requirement to close-out such position under Rule 203(b)(3) remains in effect.

So buckle up my fellow autists, the ride is only beginning.

As a follow-up to my post yesterday about BB, I wanted to attempt to place some of your worries at ease as many of you may be having second thoughts about your investments.  A link to my post yesterday will be provided at the end.

Yes, BB is dipping . However, please keep in mind that it is not dipping as hard as GME or AMC. There are reasons for this. BB had growth potential based on recent changes and it was never meant to be part of the current madness because the short interest just wasn't there compared to others.

It is apparent that of the BANG gang, AMC and GME got more media coverage than the rest despite having \*relatively\* less news than BB.  Referring to the premise of my DD yesterday, BB is a value play and NOT a get rich quick or anything play of the sort. This is a company that is reinventing their place in the corporate world, moving from phones to software development.  My smooth brain is holding on, even if it goes back to $7 because I believe in this company to reach new highs within the next year. 

If you invested yesterday after reading about how great I said BB is, I am sorry you can't buy a new Rolex today and you will need to go to Popeyes for your chicken tendies. However, that post was not meant to imply you would be posting gains porn by the end of the week. 

What we are seeing is likely a combination of paper hands getting scared of the pullback, and a correction in the stock after an unsustainable momentous gain based on the present value of the company. As they grow into their new position and make more and more deals to get their technology in everything, the stock will likely raise with it. When will this happen? Impossible to say, but the future looks bright. 

Before the recent momentum, BB was trading around $7.43. Even after the last few red days, BB is still holding over $11.50. Sure, this isn't as great as >$25, but like other stocks that go parabolic, there is an inevitable pull back. 

TL;DR - Stop being mad at your BB losses. Paper hands are for the weak. 

(Not financial advice, I am just a regular dude)

Good luck and may tendies rain down

Also before we get into this, for all the Logitech nerds on my last post, nobody cares that your mom bought you a $10 Logitech keyboard and you like the noises it makes, it doesn't change the fact that Corsair have better quality products for pretty much everything besides mice(my opinion).

&#x200B;

Ok so first things first, we all know that the gaming industry as a whole had boomed due to COVID and has had an increasing TAM for quite some time now and is projected to continue its growth. For that reason alone I'm bullish on a lot of gaming companies other than a few that I believe have way too high of a valuation.

&#x200B;

Lets start with marketing. If any of you have as poor of a social life as I since COVID started then you'd know that Corsair has been very active in social media marketing/sponsorships on Twitch. It feels like I keep seeing more and more streamers show sponsor slides of Corsair gear. This is amazing because in my personal opinion, I believe Twitch and YouTube sponsorships is easily one of the best ways to promote your products(referring to gaming products only). Just look at recent games that have all blown up, Fortnite, Apex Legends, Warzone, and Rust have all blown up due to their large presence on Twitch. Apex Legends and Rust quite literally paid streamers to play the game and look at how well that worked out for them.

&#x200B;

Next up we'll take a look at financials, don't worry I'm not going to sit here and tell you to do your full in depth fundamental analysis reasoning report but I do think we should at least pay attention to it. Even before COVID and still during COVID Corsair has increased revenues, net income, and cash flow. This just adds extra proof that its not like Corsair was a failing company before they got the boost from COVID. Another major positive would be that Corsair has increased focus around R&D which has only proven to significantly help tech companies move ahead of their competitors and acquire more market share. Just a couple companies that also focused R&D would be Tesla(all praise father Elon) and AMD. There's obviously more to the financial aspect however I'd rather not sit here and type out their entire 10-K in a reddit post.

&#x200B;

Lastly, I think with all DD you must point out the negatives as you go along. As I stated before, Logitech definitely beats Corsair when it comes to mice. However, I typed this entire post without using a mouse so who really cares about mice. Secondly, Corsair's CEO is Andy Paul. How can you put a billion dollar company in the hands of a man with two first names and to be honest, I don't know how they do it. Although that is definitely a big negative, their logo is extremely cool which I think makes up for it.

&#x200B;

Thank you for your time, now lets preheat this oven and start baking some tendies!

&#x200B;

Note: Logitech fanboys please don't attack me in the comments, I don't care about your mice, just leave me alone and go play pong or something with your amazing mouse."|2021-02-02 17:09:36.920627|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170942.csv|DueDiligence|['RSAIR', 'TO', 'THE', 'MOON']|[]|['DD', 'COVID', 'TAM', 'I', 'I', 'COVID', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'COVID', 'COVID', 'COVID', 'D', 'D', 'AMD', 'K', 'I', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'CEO', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['AMD']

More details below, based on 3 observations.

**Disclaimer: This is my DD, hence the flair.  Please do your own research. Disclosures below. This is not financial advice.**

Three observations:

1)	Elon Musk is increasingly praising a specific financial instrument on his twitter

2)	Musk needs a serious amount of silver for several of his holdings: SolarCity (owned by Tesla), SpaceX, and Tesla

3)	Musk has a history of sending out tweets that wind up changing prices of assets


Breakdown:

1) Elon Musk is hyping something on Twitter, talking about how it is on the verge of being accepted. If money goes into that thing because people anticipate a spike in value, it can't go into buying up silver metals.

Source (Elon Musk's Twitter):

2) Musk needs silver metal for many reasons: solar panels for SolarCity (owned by Tesla), solar panels for Space X satellites, electrical conductors for EVs (Tesla).  Musk wants the price of silver to stay as low as possible, since his companies will need to buy it for industrial purposes regardless. 

Sources:

SolarCity:

https://www.streetwisejournal.com/5-reasons-silver-is-gaining-in-value/  

https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/solar-driven-silver-demand-set-to-dim-as-sector-innovates-60533352

<- States that Solarcity (and others) are seeking to move from Silver to Copper, which is cheaper, but has not done yet.  Most photovoltaic cells still need silver to be built, though this may change by 2028.

SpaceX: All these satellites have 1 solar panel, and likely use silver for internal electrical components + electrical shielding.

Tesla:
https://goldsilver.com/blog/why-elon-musk-secretly-loves-silver/#:~:text=Electric%20cars%20and%20trucks%20require,management%20system%20all%20require%20silver. <-- Claiming EVs use more silver than combustion cars.

https://banyanhill.com/silver-rally-tesla-cybertruck/ <-- Same as above.

https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-01-13/The-surprising-driver-of-future-silver-demand.html <Same as above.

**So what?**
If the price of silver skyrockets, so does the cost of manufacturing solar panels (for Earth and Space) and EVs, all of which eats into $TSLA's margins, as it owns SolarCity and uses silver for electrical components (also SpaceX's). 

So Musk, in my opinion, is understandably trying to get as many impressionable retail traders over to another safe haven ASAP **so that they DON’T go into silver.**  And that's why he's pressing it so hard.
  

And I love the guy, but he does have a history of tweeting things and then prices swinging around them (#TSLA420YOLO). Silver has a lot of strong pressures to buy right now, short and long term, and **Musk knows this**, and he would prefer to avoid a major spike if possible, since his companies will need to buy silver no matter what: you can't just sub in another metal right away.


**TL;DR**: If silver goes through the roof, solar panels, satellites (panels + internal components), and  EVs become more expensive to make, all bad news for $TSLA.  Theorizing Musk is pushing another safe haven on his twitter as a distraction, hoping to divert retail funds and thus dodging a silver price retail surge from hell. 


Disclosures: I am long and currently hold positions in $PSLV, $AG, and silver mining company ETFs, $TSLA via ARKK, and 4 silver dollars my great uncle gave me when I was a kid. I also hold a small position in what Elon's pushing.

Yesterday I posted a DD on Tilray and why it was headed to the moon. Link below.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lail27/tlry_dd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

I’m returning today to inform everyone about how the $TLRY and $APHA merger happening Q2 will work. 

Based on the terms of the merger, $APHA owners will receive 83% of their $APHA shares as $TLRY stock. For all you smooth brains, this means that $APHA should be 83% of whatever $TLRY stock price is on a given day. This is currently not the case.

I have predicted that $TLRY will moon based on short interest and other DD. Link above. This means that $APHA is discounted and will follow this move. So smart money will buy $APHA to take advantage of this discount along with the impending moon of $TLRY.

Hope this helps. Don’t miss out.

I believe 6pm tonight is when new official short interest data comes out.

Basically, they keep shorting we keep holding, they will have to give out eventually given the interest one way or another. I did hear on another post these may be synthetic shorts but have a timeline as well.

It might have also lost you a lot of money. Because you just participated in what can only be described as a cultural phenomenon that turned into a massive rally against hedge funds you might have forgotten, or even never knew some things.

Everybody here is retarded, so it's retarded to use it as a kickstart platform for a social movement.

Everybody is also here to make money.

So let's talk about making some money. The entire reason GME became a target to make money on this sub had jack shit to do with a short squeeze. Initially, it was because some speculation after changes in the board. The fundamentals were not as bad as the company was priced, and it had a future.

Now the price has blown out the fundamentals, so think about the future of the company. At it's current trading price it's worth about 6 billion. Is Gamestop potentially a 20 billion company? If so, you will see retracement. If so, how long will that take? Years. Is that okay with you? I can't answer that for you, but what I can say is remember this was not initially about a short squeeze. If you still believe in the original thesis, a decrease in price means average down. If you own 10 shares @ 350, getting 100 shares again at 30 reduces your cost basis to 54, and if you think it's an $100 stock, you profitted.

The exact same thing is true for BB, and AMC. If you bought any of these for an actual reason, fix your cost basis now for the actual reason, and hold. DFV didn't get here by following a hype train, he made a solid thesis and held. Emoji's are nice and everything but take responsibility for yourselves and treat these like actual positions and fix your numbers.

Also avoid the options of these stocks if you don't understand what IV is.

Then the RH crap happened and a lot of short was covered, blowing up the stock price.  It recovered some on Friday as positions were covered before close of the week.  

Something else happened though - they started shorting even more.  They saw that a squeeze happened and believed that would end it and it would all be done.  I don't think there are ladder attacks, any secret formula, or any other conspiracies going on.  What is happening is we are in the middle of a battle between various whales.  The more of us there are, the more the balance shifts towards the longs.  Looking at short interest, it is still >50% so that is good for the squeeze.  But we have to realize - this isn't the same game anymore.

The old shorts have been covered, we are now up against the new shorts.  It is still incredibly heavily shorted.  The old reason of the stock blowing up was the exponentially increasing media attention bringing on new buyers.  They are gone now.  What happens next?  

I don't think we have to dig super deeply into key dates, failure to delivers, expirations.  I think the squeeze can start again when another market factor hits.  When GME makes a statement, when market conditions change, something.  We saw a downward trend as folks were paper handed out of this stock.  We saw an uptick when it hit the bottom and folks had some hope of a squeeze.  I predict nothing big will change in the next few days unless there is a significant change in information.  But nothing will happen if we don't hold, that's the only thing for sure.

If you look at its business the four years prior to 2020, it was fairly stable with revenues during that 4 year period ranging from $25.3-25.9B with EBITDA greater than $2.1B for each year during that period. They were aggressively deleveraging during this period having reduced debt from $7.6B to $4.2B (these number exclude capital leases). Then in 2020, the COVID crisis occurred and Macy’s business suffered mightily as stores were closed due to local restrictions. Management took a number of actions such as raising additional cash, suspending the dividend, cutting CAPEX, closing unprofitable stores, reducing inventory and cutting SG&A. In 2020, sales will likely end up being down about 30% to $17.8B with EBITDA being slightly positive (\~$50M). But I would argue that 2020 will be the trough in revenues and earnings for Macy’s. As we move into 2021 and the pandemic mitigates, people will return to shopping in stores and Macy’s sales will start to show Y/Y positive comps as they progress through the year. Current average analyst expectations for 2021 call for M to make $0.65/share.  


However, I believe that Wall Street is way too bearish on this company. Currently 6 analysts rate Macy’s as a sell with one brave analyst going positive on the company in December with a Buy rating. But if you look at the last two earnings releases, Macy’s blew away analyst’s weak expectations by wide margins with upside surprises of $0.96/share in Q2 and $0.60/share in Q3. With this bearish slant, I believe M will blow away expectations again in Q4. The average analyst expectation only calls for earnings of $0.04/share in the holiday quarter. But I project they will make just shy of $1/share (ex. items) assuming sales come in about $6.7B. Part of the reason for the bearish stance is many of these analyst’s clients are short Macy’s stock.  


One of the biggest arguments shorts make is the Macy’s in too indebted with high interest debt. But at the end of Q3, M had $1.55B in cash on the balance sheet and had net debt of only $3.8B. The cash level will only improve coming out of the holiday quarter where EBITDA will be greater than $700M. When revenues return to normalized levels, the debt level is <2x EBITDA. With the cash on the balance sheet, they have ample liquidity to cover interest payments of $80M/quarter. Also, no significant debt maturities are coming due in the next couple years that are not already covered by existing cash and future cash flows. Some of M’s debt is secure by their real estate holdings which is valued at double the current market cap of the company.  


When I look at how they compare against competitors, their stock price currently is priced at a discount. Macy’s sells for a P/S of 0.24 compared with Kohl’s (0.42), Dillard’s (0.43) or Nordstrom’s (0.51). One could argue that share price should be selling for around $30/share to have comparable valuations. But I would argue that Macy’s should have a higher multiple due to their e-Commerce business which made up 38% of sales in the most recent quarter growing at a 27% Y/Y clip. Macy’s is currently the 10th largest e-Commerce retailer in the US (Amazon is #1 and sports a 4.5 P/S). If I look at those on the list that are slightly bigger players, all are brick & mortars and sport much higher P/S ratios, #7 Best Buy (0.62), #8 Target (1.04) and #9 Costco (0.91). If valued with a similar P/S ratio, Macy’s should sell for $38-65/share.  


Part of the reason Macy’s share price is depressed is because it is heavily shorted. Currently over 28% of the float is short the stock. The shorts are unjustifiable bearish on a company that is undervalued compared to its peer even though has a greater e-Commerce presence and will be returning to profitability in 2021 post COVID. But I think other players in the market will exploit this heavily shorted situation in the near term by pushing the shares higher. Heavy buying of Feb. 19 calls would suggest the price will be pushed higher ahead of the company’s earnings release which will likely happen late in February. If Q4 earnings exceed analyst expectations by a large margin as I expect, we could see a short squeeze due to the heavy short interest.  


We will see what happens with Macy’s this month and longer term. My contention is it is worth a lot more than $15/share, more realistically it is worth $30-40/share, which is why I am long."|2021-02-02 17:09:36.920627|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170941.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['B', 'B', 'BITDA', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'COVID', 'CAPEX', 'A', 'B', 'BITDA', 'I', 'Y', 'M', 'I', 'I', 'M', 'I', 'B', 'M', 'B', 'B', 'BITDA', 'M', 'BITDA', 'I', 'S', 'I', 'Y', 'US', 'I', 'S', 'S', 'COVID', 'I', 'I', 'I']|[]

Listen to me when I speak these words (mods pls don't delete). Today is the worst it can get. We hit a floor at $80 due to short ladder attacks over the last few days. $80 is the neutral price target that the guys over at [www.gmedd.com](https://www.gmedd.com) assigned, realistically it can't drop lower without it literally being an undervalued stock. No one of GME gang is selling, so stop pointing fingers at eachother. Only margin call marvins are forced to sell, may their hands rest in paper. Overall this is blatant artifical price lowering that will come back to bite the hedge funds in the ass eventually. Just wait and see.

Let's cut to the chase: everyone that saw their unrealised gains evaporate over the last couple of days and turn into losses needs to chill the fuck out. The best thing to compare this to in your mind is a tsunami. **At first, there is an earthquake**. This is our subreddit getting GME on our radars and massively buying in, this has become an international movement against corporate greed. The shock was felt throughout the entire financial ecosystem.  
**Then because of the earthquake, the ocean pulls back from the shores.** This is the hedge funds attacking us with all kinds of illegal manipulation right now to try and pull us apart, they try to make us sell our stock at prices that are below five digits (what are they thinking?). **But what the hedge funds forget is that when the ocean pulls back, a big wave is forming silently in the distance**. A wave (the MOASS) with such a colossal force that it will wipe out anything standing in its way. And when that wave hits, there will be hell to pay.

You guys only need to **diamond hold on for your dear lives** while the wave builds. I know things seem bleak right now, but there is no way the squeeze doesn't happen at this point. Remember, the hedge funds initially got in at a price of $20 and pushed it down to $4. The $80 floor is still 4 times their initial buy in price. Of course, over the times old shorters sold their positions to new shorters, but the positions remain the same. Those loons are still betting for a GameStop bankruptcy. Hedge funds have been bleeding ever since the price recovered to $20 and continue to bleed at this very moment, eventually they will have to throw in the towel. Despite what you may read on this forum from very motivated autists with good intentions, it is impossible to know when exactly the squeeze will happen because that is up to the hedgies themselves. **All I know is that right now the tsunami alarms are going off and all hedge funds must be evacuated. Because the Big Wave is building up at this very moment and will inevitably hit the shores.** Thanks for reading this until the end. Stay healthy, stay safe and most of all: hold GME because *you like the stock*.

Daily loss porn posts have turned into large text posts of motivation / $GME speculation / insane $GME profit. Like many people here, I kinda like the direction things are heading in right now. That being said, we all need to start putting in work.

So many people who don't even own shares are commenting in the Daily Discussion threads causing quite a few people to feel a semblance of doubt. So many bots / interns are trying to sway the hivemind into being scared. Neither party realizes, as sad as it may be, none of us here can read.

I hold 25 shares of GME, I went all in with my savings @ $80. Yes, I can afford to lose that amount of money. No, I am not complaining about anything money related in this post. I, like many others, have seen our accounts reach numbers that before last week, we didn't even think possible. Mine personally hit a high of $12,000 or so. I have never had that much money in my life. Did I cash out? No, of course not.

Come today, where I have less than $500 profit, and I am still very happy with how everything is going. I'm going to start telling some information that some people are going to question: on Thursday we will prevail. Thursday is an important day - I predict tomorrow we will see status quo with the last few days - but on Thursday, everything changes for us.

To begin with, it is the day in which I become one year more retarded. Secondly, the phase of the moon that night correlates perfectly to millions being added to our side. Third - hear me out - we are too fucking powerful for these Hedge Fund looking assholes to withstand 4 days of this shit.

This is where we fight, this is where we stand, and this is where we will prevail. I will see you on the moon Thursday / Friday, young retards.

A lot of you don't know me, as I don't usually post here. I'm usually over at /r/AMD_stock posting DD there. But I'm posting here because the recent activity in the stock led me to realize a huge, glaring problem with the stock's performance and it's latest earnings.

Let me step back a bit first.

Last Friday the stock plummeted 12% after posting the best earnings it possibly could have posted. At AMD_Stock, we usually brush off the post-earnings crush and continue our bull plays (or the smarter ones wait until after earnings to get back in). But this post-earnings crush was different. For this earnings, there was zero fundamental reason why the stock should go down. The earnings were excellent, the margins were excellent, the guidance for 1Q21 was incredible, and the guidance for FY21 was almost double what the street was expecting. Yet the stock still went down. It went down from $94 pre-earnings to almost $84....*on the best possible news*. 

What more could the street have wanted? Did shareholders want a +60% revenue increase YoY, instead of just +40%? Did they want 3x year-over-year revenue in 1Q20, instead of just 2x? Did the street expect us to beat our FY20 targets by more than they anticipated? Did investors want the fab capacity issues to be completely resolved earlier than 2Q21? Did they want Milan to be released earlier than March '21? Was there any reason to sell off after an earnings as incredible as that? You could even see the [bewilderment](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/27/full-interview-with-amd-ceo-lisa-su-on-q4-results-product-pipeline-demand-and-more.html) on Lisa Su's face as she started an interview with CNBC the morning after.

Why? [No financial news](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-q4-2020-advanced-micro-devices-earnings/), not even [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/amd-amd-earnings-q4-2020.html), could pin a 'reason' on the drop.

And then I realized the problem. It's you.

You buy the cheapest AMD weeklies you can and hold them through earnings like it can't go tits up. You hope that AMD beats all expectations, and that the stock price skyrockets on your tendie-train choo-choo-ing to the moon. Post-earnings you sell your OTM calls just as they go ITM to some suck-ass broker-dealer, and go do some hookers and blow and make a golden shrine to Mama Su and thank her for your amazing luck. Good thing those stupid broker-dealers were so desperate to buy your calls just before expiry.. you would have bankrupted them if you held on to them any longer!

The day after earnings comes and you wake up and the price is down 5% and dropping. You sell immediately, because you can't see it recovering by Friday, when your calls expire. This causes MMs to sell the shares they bought as a hedge against selling you your calls. Stock goes down further. Other people sell their calls, and MMs sell more shares to reduce the hedge even more, on and on until Friday expiration rolls around and bag-holders let their calls expire worthless, along with their hopes and dreams.

Stop losing at AMD! How? *INVEST PROPERLY*

How? Buy and hold shares or LEAPS. Stop chasing the mythical overnight gains. AMD is a *long-term success* and it has [room to double](https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l6jijo/rosenblatt_securities_says_amd_could_double_in/). DO IT NOW - Price is recovering from the crush, but are still trading at a [20% discount to analyst consensus](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast), and at a 10% discount from it's recent highs.

Conclusion: This is a better buy-and-hold than GME, BB, or anything. AMD has grown continuously in the past 5 years and, if you read the DD on /r/AMD_stock, you'll discover that it also has an incredible growth roadmap the next 5 years.

This has been a rough week so far. GME is closing at around 90, and either you are seeing massive losses, or the unrealized gains you had evaporate right in front of your eyes. The media is spewing out 200 articles per day saying 'Gamestop is over', and that anyone who stays in the stock is retarded.

But it's simple. As Mark Cuban himself said,  

>If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.  
>  
>Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of.

And ask yourself, **what WSB is really made of?** Is it just plain autistic and retarded traders? Yes, but we also have our Diamond community. People that are actively trying to beat the market, that do their due diligence, and that want to bathe in chicken tendies.

And we have seen post after post of their DD, reinforcing over and over what we were always here for.   
And let me tell you: **Nothing has changed.**

# The short term plan (SHORT SQUEEZE)

Alright, I'll bust out the numbers quick:   
[https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&submit=Short+Quote™](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&submit=Short+Quote™) says that the Short Interest is stil  61,780,000 shares, or 120%. The shorters have obviously refilled their shorts, knowing that their **market manipulation has driven the price down wonders.**

**Their greatest hope** to **avoid** the *Squozening* is to scare off everyone who is holding. They won't stop dumping the stock using everything they have to keep the price away from execution princes, and **avoid getting gamma squeezed again.**

**But,** this doesn't change that 120% of short interest is still insane. They have RELOADED their own failure, failing to acknowledge the power the retail trading community posseses. 

In fact, the stock has been put in the NYSE restricted list of Short selling. They quite literally can't short this stock anymore. So once this rises again, the MMs have NO REASON to start dropping the price again, as they can't benefit once more from shorting on the way down.

This week we are extremely weak as a community due to the immense number of traders having to transfer to Fidelity/Schwab/other brokers, and the MMs have clearly made great use of this. Hell, Drivewealth, one of the biggest clearing brokers for international traders (such as myself), restricted buying GME, and have said to be able to clear buying GME very soon

But as the fund transfers are complete, and Robinhood acquires more capital to realize their trades, and the other brokers lift restrictions, GME will MOST DEFINITIVELY skyrocket. Once the rocket starts going off again, ALL THE FOMO FROM PEOPLE WHO MISSED 300+ WILL SHOW!

**So the SHORT SQUEEZE STILL CAN HAPPEN.** 

# The long term plan (RYAN COHEN IS GOD, Q4 is still coming)

Don't forget that we still have Ryan Cohen on board, and with expected record sales from this console cycle, Gamestop is very far away from going bankrupt. 

Remember: The ideal situation for shorts is a bankruptcy/delisting.

Ryan Cohen is still in, the Quarterly report for GME is still coming, and the long term prospects of the company are still FUCKING BULLISH.  Even if we can't force a squeeze in february, long term changes done to the company can still trigger a short squeeze. In fact, most of the rise of GME so far has been done through investors buying in, not through short squeezes. 

Yes, it is fact that many shorts have covered (At BILLIONS of losses), but this doesn't change our fundamental thesis: *Gamestop + Ryan Cohen = Rokit mun*. The VW squeeze happened after DAYS of red, you better believe we can end up waiting for a month for the squoze.

# TLDR: HOLD OR BUY MORE, YOU FUCKING APES. IT'S NOT OVER. You know why? BECAUSE

# WE. LIKE. THE. STOCK.

I know this isnt GME DD, (and you mother fuckers better not sell GME to buy into this) but this is too good to miss out on.

Chart Analysis:

Dollar General is near its 6M low, incredibly oversold and anything near 190 is a fucking steal. Overall, the RSI is 41 on the yearly and trading well under the 50 and 200 SMA.

*Processing img 0a4wq3jco4f61...*

I know the F word is shunned here and I don't use it very much, but the FUNDAMENTALS ARE FUCKING CRAZY. With these fundamentals the price it's trading at it is criminal. After consulting the Bloomberg terminal, the monkey analysts have a price target of $235 and the majority of them have buy ratings on the stock. In addition, Dollar General has an estimated revenue of +20%  YoY and a P/E ratio of 19. Overall the sentiment on DG is very bullish, and If you don't give a shit about what the analysts say the value of the stock is shown in the fundamentals, they are just confirmation bias.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Play/TL;DR:

Earnings is on March 11, I expect a good run up correction before then. The Fundamentals show that IT LITERALLY CANT GO TITS UP.

You might think that you would never FOMO into a stock or you might be wondering if this applies to you. Ask yourself these questions to find out if you need the checklist. 

- Have you ever thought of buying some super hyped shares at ATH?

- Have you thought about joining ‘the team’ in the squeeze on stockthatshallnotbenamed? (Ps. there are no teams in retail investing it’s every man for himself)

- Do you use WallStreetBets? 

If you answered yes to any of the precursor questions below then you are in danger of a FOMO trade and need this checklist. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HOW NOT TO FOMO CHECKLIST 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Ask yourself why you want to buy the stock. Are you jealous of others gains? Do you want to be part of that weeks big thing? If yes to either then do not buy. Jealous trading is bad trading. 

2. Warren Buffet said “be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.” Ask yourself if people are being greedy with the stock you want to buy, do not buy if they are. 

3. Ask yourself “am I being a sheep?” Sheep do not make money on the stock market, they don’t even understand the stock market, they are sheep. Don’t be a sheep. 

4. Where did you see the stock? If it was on the news don’t buy it. If it’s trending on one of the subreddits then it’s probably too late. 

5. Is it often appearing on the subreddit and being regularly pushed by the same small crowd? Watch out cause without proof they are probably bag holders hoping to pass the bag to you. 

6. Can you explain to somebody what the company does and why it is a good idea to buy it? If not then you shouldn’t buy it yourself. 

7. Is the market mostly red or mostly green that week? Sell on green weeks and buy on red weeks. It might feel like the other way around at the time but that’s emotional trading. 
8. Is it a meme stock? If yes then be an early adopter or don’t adopt at all. 

9. Have you got spare capital? If money is no issue to you or if you are making a small punt that won’t harm your finances then go ahead. If you are making a big, late move into a meme stock then you’ll be seeing red. 

10. Does it have emojis in the DD’s? If yes then disregard all previous steps and bet your house on it."|2021-02-02 17:09:36.920627|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170941.csv|DueDiligence|['A', 'FOMO']|[]|['FOMO', 'ATH', 'FOMO', 'HOW', 'NOT', 'TO', 'FOMO', 'KLIST', 'I']|[]

***TLDR: I think I've found at least 3 violations of SEC regulations?***

Compiling some research, post not complete but being used for dumping SEC regulations that appear to have been violated based on last weeks GME shenanigans:

1) ***Rule 201 – Short Sale Price Test Circuit Breaker.*** Rule 201 generally requires trading centers to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to prevent the execution or display of a short sale at an impermissible price when a stock has triggered a circuit breaker by experiencing ***a price decline of at least 10 percent in one day.*** *Once the circuit breaker in Rule 201 has been triggered, the price test restriction* ***will apply to short sale orders in that security for the remainder of the day and the following day,*** unless an exception applies.

2) ***Rule 203(b)(1) and (2) – Locate Requirement.*** Regulation SHO requires a broker-dealer to have ***reasonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed*** so that it can be delivered on the date delivery is due before effecting a short sale order in any equity security.[[7]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn7) ***This “locate” must be made and documented prior to effecting the short sale.***

3) ***Rule 204 – Close-out Requirement.*** Rule 204 requires brokers and dealers that are participants of a registered clearing agency[[8]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn8) to take action to close out failure to deliver positions. Closing out requires the broker or dealer to purchase or borrow securities of like kind and quantity. 

The participant must close out a failure to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+4. If a participant has a failure to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona fide market making activities, the participant must close out the failure to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. 

If the position is not closed out, the broker or dealer and any broker or dealer for which it clears transactions (for example, an introducing broker)[[9]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn9) may not effect further short sales in that security without borrowing or entering into a bona fide agreement to borrow the security (known as the “pre-borrowing” requirement) until the broker or dealer purchases shares to close out the position and the purchase clears and settles. 

In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO ***requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out failures to deliver in securities with large and persistent failures to deliver,*** referred to as “threshold securities,” ***if the failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.***[[10]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn10) 

Threshold securities are equity securities[[11]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn11) that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency (e.g., National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)); ***totaling 10,000 shares or more; and equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer's total shares outstanding.*** 

As provided in Rule 203 of Regulation SHO, threshold securities are included on a list disseminated by a self-regulatory organization (“SRO”). Although as a result of compliance with Rule 204, generally a participant’s fail to deliver positions will not remain for 13 consecutive settlement days, ***if, for whatever reason, a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency in a threshold security for 13 consecutive settlement days, the requirement to close-out such position under Rule 203(b)(3) remains in effect.***

Still reading through it myself but it seems that there have been violations of ***SHO Rules 201,203, and 204, any input would be greatly appreciated!***

***TLDR;***

***1) NO SHORTS should have been executed Thursday when GME dropped down to $132 because it fell more than 10%***

***2) No new shorts should have been issued because there's no reasonable belief that they could find actual stock to lend given 140% short float, and I doubt they secured it PRIOR to issuing new stock***

***3)They should have already executed the failed to delver shorts ASAP because of the high number of FTD's and the high number of shorted shares***

So to start off I wanna disclose my GME position. I bought 1 share at $20 and 🧻🙌 at $30. I then rebought in with .9 shares at a 152 avg and I am still holding them but we all know what happened Thursday and me literally living paycheck to paycheck I couldn’t invest more on fidelity or Webull without selling my 122 shares of AMC at 5.69 (nice), and my 24 share of BB.

With that being said I am still HOLDING even at a loss and here is why:

So to start off I need to clear something up THE VW CHART IS OVER A YEAR AND GME IS OVER A MONTH. If you zoom out to 3 months or further you see how high GME jumped. So to be a 🌈🐻 here Thursday might have been the short squeeze and due to RH and other companies cutting off trading stopped the squeeze. The problem here is that a lot of GME investors then became emotionally invested which lead to this sub being flooded with RH hate and post about the squeeze has not been squoze. Now this MAY be true still but I may also be wrong.

WHY I AM HOLDING

1. 💎🙌 what if the squeeze hasn’t been squoze?

2. I only have $150 in which although is a good amount for me it is nothing compared to what I see some people have in it and if they can hold/ stick it to the HFs so can I.

3. I think GME has a future now. If Ryan Cohen can do what he did with Chewy then there is no reason GME won’t have a solid low price stock that will slowly climb.

4. GME is now the brand of a “movement”. I see a lot of talk on here about going to GameStop now and in the future for anything video game related in order to ensure that they don’t get bankrupted by HFs and if this continues that would be good for the company since there are 8+ mil of us on this sub. Combine that with the insane amount of free advertisement from media and billboards (I even bought one in New Orleans for a few days with $20 since RH wouldn’t let me invest) and even people who aren’t on WSB now have GameStop in the back of their minds. This company now has a second chance to do it right.

5. This is more of a personal reason but lets say GME bottoms out and doesn’t squeeze, I’m just gonna BUY THE DIP and this will average down my cost of $152 per share and since I like this stock I can just hold long term and as the company grows so will my stock and profit. Now I understand this might not work if you have a ton of money in but for people in my situation who believe in Ryan Cohen and GameStop this is a viable strategy to 💎🙌 your way to a profit.

So I just wanna thank everybody on this sub for the week of memes, calling out of a corrupt system, donations to charity and hopefully the saving of GameStop I’m glad I was and still am a part of this history.

TLDR; VW squeeze and GME squeeze are different don’t compare but if you can afford to and truly like the stock 💎🙌 GME worst case scenario you save a company that has a new lease on life and best case 🚀🚀🚀🚀 to the 🌕 while the HFs go down.

Edit 1: I also just realized they GME used to pay dividends.

Today we saw our precious $GME fall to a level we have not seen since last Thursday - and then ever further beyond that point. We entered AH today at a lowly $90 per share. We may be entering our darkest hour yet.

Today we also got some good news too - the Mark Cuban AMA went well, and AMC theaters are reopening soon! Some executives are sharing that we may get $GME to over $1,000 soon, and if you compare our graphs with the Volkswagen graph from 2008, we have the M shape, we have the dip, and now we await the spike.

Let's get into what today meant for us. This has been a second hard day this week. Many are seeing either massive losses or unrealized gains evaporating. The media is delivering article after article on GameStop, literally every time the price falls a single dollar it seems. Today we have learned some new things - some of you may have read this, some of you may have learned this the hard way, and some of you might not accept this: if YOU personally can afford to hold this stock, you hold. Why would you sell? We have seen where this can go, we have seen how badly these guys are bleeding, we have seen the stock bounce from 450 to 124 to 300 in a span of 24 hours.

As of today, there are only 2.5 days for Wall Street to cover their shorts. This is a wave that is building up slowly and we are not going to let it go. We could potentially fuck Melvin and the gang THIS WEEK. In another post I made earlier today I had mentioned Thursday as my estimation of t-day (tendies day) - I still stand by that: Thursday will be the beginning, but Thursday will not be the end of anything. Posts today have mentioned that Melvin may be committing massive fraud by illegally covering their shorts - and I believe them.

As investors, we control the market by holding. The people we are fighting against, Melvin and Gang, they can't do this forever. Hell, they probably can't do this for another week. They have spent the last few days sowing dissent in our community, monitoring everything we do, and trying to get the upper hand yet again. The only problem for them - they can't. As long as WE hold our shares, they have already lost. They would need to get people like DFV to sell in order to make a dent in our morale.

**So what does any of what I just said mean?**

We are gonna see status quo tomorrow. Buy the fire sale if you like the stock, if you don't, don't. Thursday or Friday, we start seeing a fire get lit underneath Melvin's hairy nuts and we will watch it spread viciously, all while making ourselves a quick buck.

**Will there be a lot of time for us all to get out?**

Like anything like this, some will make more than others. Selling lowers the price of a stock. If you need $10,000 for a life saving surgery, pull out at $10,000. We joke a lot about how everyone needs to hold, but most people will not hold it against you. We get that sometimes the money IS more important than the cause.

**What if it doesn't happen this Thursday/Friday?**

Then we wait. This is a game of patience. To the patient go the tendies!

**What is a short ladder attack?**

Hedgefunds bid on each other's stock, lowering the price artificially. There is little volume on these trades - since nobody can buy, it plummets the price. The only effect it has is if we sell, which not many people are doing.

**Why are so many people still holding? Why didn't we cash out earlier?**

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. This event has the potential to change lives and change rules. Personally, as long as I sell over 80$, I won't be sad.

Position: 25 shares @ 80$

Note: this is not financial advice in any way, I have a PhD in Apenomics, but I sadly am illiterate and have no thumbs. Thank you u/SEC.

I've borrowed and dumbed down this chart from [this savant's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l97jbo/gamestop_big_picture_market_mechanics/).

As the free-flowing stock dries up (due to ppl buying and holding), the volatility increases. It becomes easier and easier to move the needle with less money. As long as you keep holding and buying, the volatility will only increase. **Expect huge swings in the next few days.**

Hedge funds know this. They tanked the stock this morning with ladder attacks. Right now they intentionally leveling the demand to keep the stock price stable; to make it look like the ride is over.

HOWEVER

The short float is still high, and the [volume has been steadily decreasing](https://i.imgur.com/eRH3S2b.png).

**Furthermore, GME just got put on the** [NSYE Short Sale Restrictions List](https://www.wallstreetdaily.com/2019/05/20/ssr-what-it-is-and-what-you-need-to-know/). Tomorrow (for one day only)  short-sale orders can only be executed at a price higher than the current best bid. This will put a huge damper on the shorties ability to lower the price.

Keep in mind the VW squeeze happened with far less short-interest than is currently in GME. The main problem is that retail investors, unlike huge firms, can't vacuum up all the supply fast enough, which enables the hf to slowly wiggle their way out buying up paper hands. They've likely exited their worst short positions and reshorted at a better price.

Some people are saying the squeeze might be more of a slow gradual upward pressure, rather than a sudden event. The truth is that the hedge funds are walking on a tightrope, and this stock is still extremely volatile. Any big movements in demand can drastically impact the price.

Disclaimer: I am a poker player, not a day trader.  In poker, this is what we call an ""implied odds play"". The risk is relatively small for us bulls (relative to the short position), but the expected value is potentially huge if it works.  But these plays are still risky despite being +EV. **You have to be prepared to ride the swings and embrace the variance.**

As I'm sure many of you who have been following the ""Counterfeit Shares"" theory about the various short attacks on $GME have seen, the SEC publishes lagged data on the cumulative number of Fails to Deliver for every company. If you aren't caught up with the latest info on the counterfeit share theory, take a second and read [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/)'s \[post\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the\_real\_reason\_wall\_street\_is\_terrified\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)) laying out the issue with hedge funds counterfeiting shares and how it relates to GME. Much of the analysis in Johnny's post comes from an article \[""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""\]([http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)) which is definitely worth a read if you have the time and patience to do a deep dive into the evil shit carried out by hedge funds.

**TLDR of Johnny's post:** Hedge funds create a bunch of stock out of thin air and short it, selling the counterfeit shares on the open market and driving the price of a company down. They then fail to come up with the shares they sold in time, so the ""counterfeit"" shares are never backed up by real shares. This could be happening on a massive scale with GME, and Hedge Funds could have far greater exposure to GME than previously thought.

&#x200B;

**The Data:**

I noticed that while [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and later [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/) used data from the SEC releases in their posts, the data they actually showed was only a small piece, and lacked very important context. So, with that in mind, I took the SEC Fails-to-Deliver data \[releases\]([https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)) for both halves of November and December and the first half of January and took a look at what was going on using some pivot tables. I thought given the sheer amount of data (1.5 million cells) it would be tough to load in Excel but it actually ended up being pretty easy. (probably helped that my day job is just alternately making pivot tables and slamming my head into the wall, I've gotten pretty good at both)

IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS RELEASE EXTENDS TO JANUARY 14TH, 2021. THESE ARE NOT CURRENT CUMULATIVE OUTSTANDING FAIL-TO-DELIVER LEVELS

&#x200B;

**Fails-to-Deliver Distributions:**

First, take a look at this handy histogram(ish) of companies with outstanding Fails-to-Deliver and their outstanding ""counterfeit share"" (cumulative Fails-to-Deliver) numbers:

https://preview.redd.it/6dmfpfql47f61.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf38fea8f5de2e45b36b48853f4d7afaca8f6c28

As you can see, GME is way outside of the pack when it comes to Fail to Delivers, and has significantly more ""counterfeit shares"" (FTDs) than almost any other company. The exact number comes in at a cool 621,483 shares. The x-axis scale isn't even linear, and you can see significant jumps in the last quarter.

&#x200B;

If you think that's some crazy shit, wait until you see the distribution of Fail-to-Delivers per company by the dollar value of counterfeit shares ((Closing Price)\*(# of Outstanding Fails-to-Deliver)):

https://preview.redd.it/024mdiv147f61.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=270fc53a5455994545a864e8b8e9c304b0e57b5c

GameStop has the SECOND HIGHEST Fails-to-Deliver net dollar value of all 5,147 stocks with current fail-to-delivers (as of 1/14/21). NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS of stock floating around that was simply created out of thin air. Here the x-axis isn't even linear either — if it were to scale, GME would be several meters to my right. Wild.

&#x200B;

**Cumulative Fails-to-Deliver of GME over Time:**

Moving on to more interesting (and potentially more troubling) data, I took a look at the Fails-to-Deliver values over time for GME. I decided to go back to the beginning of November, then look at every number the SEC had released since on FTDs for GME. This is crucial context for the numbers that have been thrown around by [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/).

https://preview.redd.it/myt4zxy347f61.png?width=1328&format=png&auto=webp&s=603b5d5f0a623dc0dc9ef0df1f3da05e7361340f

Now, this one is a lot less clear-cut than those histograms I just wrote about. As you can see, there have been huge fluctuations in the amount of ""counterfeit stock"" (Fails-to-Deliver) on the market. There is a definite pattern of Hedge Funds running up Fails-to-Deliver during GME surges and then covering once the price slumps a bit. I've talked with one of my sources involved with hedge fund operations, and he said this is pretty standard procedure — when you sell a naked short and the price spikes, you talk it out with your broker and get a few more days to cover. So really, this pattern is more or less normal. It's the stupidly large amounts Fails-to-Deliver that are getting churned that is the irregular part.

Here's a good spot to bring up my main concern with the kind of analyses that [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/) were putting out. You can see that there were 1.8 million Fails-to-Deliver on GME on December 2nd, but that number was basically completely covered by the 16th. Based on that data it seems at first glance that, for the most part, these reported Fails-to-Deliver are Hedge Funds/Brokers trying to avoid covering while high and simply waiting for the next dip. This data alone IS NOT SUFFICIENT to prove that there is an enormous, market-moving quantity of Fails-to-Deliver floating around the market. Of course, right after this data cuts out, GME shoots to the moon (300+), and I would expect a lot of naked short vendors were caught with their pants down. Maybe they all covered on the recent dips, maybe loads of Fails-to-Deliver are still out there.

A table with that GME info from the graph above for any lurking nerds:

https://preview.redd.it/0pj2hh0647f61.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcf2d64f6777218dece7735075b779fb51e28cca

&#x200B;

**Some Questionable Inferences and My Retarded Conclusions:**

So, what's the takeaway here, other than don't trust everything you read on WallStreetBets? I think there are a few lessons. First, even though Fails-to-Deliver numbers were bouncing all over the place, including being completely covered on 12/16, I think it's important to keep in mind that GME having this volume of Fails-to-Deliver, both in shares and in dollars, is extremely irregular compared to everything else. Could just be the fact that GME is an insane stock with insane volatility,\* or could be indicative of something more.

*\*Yet, this data is from back before GME became mainstream — GME in December was not an ""unprecedented situation"" like we have now. Thinking back to then, the high Fails-to-Deliver numbers are even more significant.*

&#x200B;

**A Possibility of Hedge Fund Armageddon:**

I want to take a second to talk about one of the diagrams from the good folks who wrote \[""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""\]([http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)), detailing both the ""surface level"" indicators of Disclosed Shorts and Fails-to-Deliver, and the below-the-surface hidden pathways that they believed pumped counterfeit shares into our financial system. Here it is:

https://preview.redd.it/v3io9bj847f61.jpg?width=1086&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21d67bbec3d7d4e3b2012b3d51cdaf462ae3318d

As you can see, the Counterfeiting 2.0 authors believed that Fails-to-Deliver were just the tip of the iceberg. Below the surface (and out of the sight of the SEC), they believed there was a massive volume of shares that had been ""laundered,"" through foreign exchanged, offshore funds, or even gaps in the Continuous Net Clearing system at the DTCC. These stocks, theoretically, go from Fails-to-Deliver to simple counterfeit shares, or even straight to counterfeits. The arguments in the Counterfeiting 2.0 paper go way over my head as a simple retard, but I get the gut feeling at least some of them are accurate.

If, hypothetically, (please read this part in your best Ben Shapiro voice), the arguments in Counterfeiting 2.0 are true, then it is highly likely that the huge Fails-to-Deliver churn on the surface is just the tip of a massive illegal counterfeit short position. GME BULLS, listen up. If this counterfeit short position does exist, then it was probably entered back when GME was being driven towards bankruptcy, at a share price somewhere in the $15/20 range, and possibly expanded when GME was being driven down below $5. There are actually interesting data to suggest that this is a plausible scenario. First, the fact that, as [/u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) noted a year ago, the market cap of GME was driven below the net value of its assets. Obviously, this happens from time to time, but it's indicative of an extremely artificially depressed valuation. Secondly, the central use of illegal naked shorting is in driving companies to bankruptcy, and it did seem like GME was on its way out. Looking at GME as a scummy hedge fund manager, it would have made a very attractive target for a naked-short dilution attack.

These illegal short positions, if they were not covered by cautious (lol) Hedgies at the beginning of the GME runup, would have increased 50-100x in dollar value as the share price of GME rose. That's 5,000-10,000% for those who can't do basic math. Now I don't know if this scenario would be enough to crash the market, but it would certainly be enough to make a lot of extremely powerful people (currently engaged in a criminal enterprise) desperate and very, very angry. This hardly needs saying, but rich bastards have killed for far less than a billion dollars. Here, there could be tens of billions on the line.

So, that's the mega-bull case. We, the tards of WSB, expose billions in financial crime. The SEC rappels into Citadel and arrests everyone, Robinhood goes bankrupt, and all our wives and their boyfriends get filthy rich. However, there is also a very significant BEAR case here. If the regular, everyday investors who wrote Counterfeiting 2.0 were in fact retards like us, then there's a significant chance that they simply got it wrong. Maybe there is no sea of hidden counterfeit short positions, and maybe this whole Fails-to-Deliver thing is just rich assholes using extra trading days to cheaply sell shorts. What then? In that case, I would bet my left nut that all of the outstanding Fails-to-Deliver have been covered in the recent slump, and this whole exciting report is largely irrelevant to the future performance of GME.

I'm not going to make the case that either the bulls or the bears are right (even though my gut is with the bulls) because I simply don't have the information or mental capacity to make that call. Look at the data yourself, and draw your own conclusions. Retail is facing an enemy with more capital, more information, more experience, and fewer morals. Whichever way it goes, it's going to be an ugly fight.

Positions: 12 shares (Bought 50 at $20, sold 50 at $250, bought back in 12 at $300). I plan to hold until either $4,000 a share or things go to shit.

&#x200B;

I am not a financial advisor, and I do not advise any readers to make financial decisions based on my opinions or the information presented in this report.

&#x200B;

# TLDR: the cumulative Fails-to-Deliver volume on GME is massive compared to the rest of the market. However, is also extremely volatile, and small compared to the float. It is possible that high Fails-to-Deliver volume is a result of massive illegal share counterfeiting by shorts.

Corsair IPO'ed in September at $17.00 and the stock went rocket rocket straight upto 30$+. The all time highs has been 50$ ish and is currently trading at 38$. They absolutely destroyed Q3 earnings and beat expectations in every department.   


**Here's some of the highlights of their Q3 earnings, Source :- globenewswire & their Q3 report.**

Net revenue was $457.1 million, an increase of 60.7% year-over-year. Segment net revenue was $161.6 million, an increase of 128.8% year-over-year. Gaming components and systems segment net revenue was $295.5 million, an increase of 38.3% year-over-year.

Gross profit was $127.9 million, an increase of 112.4% year-over-year, with gross margin of 28.0%, an improvement of 680 basis points year-over-year.

Operating income was $49.7 million, an increase of 353.6% year-over-year.

Adjusted operating income was $61.4 million, an increase of 193.7% year-over-year.

Net income was $36.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.5 million in the same period a year ago, or $0.02 per diluted share.

Adjusted net income was $48.5 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, an increase of 384.0% year-over-year compared to adjusted net income of $10.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.

Adjusted EBITDA was $63.7 million, an increase of 184.9% year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.9%, an improvement of 610 basis points year-over-year.

As of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $370.1 million.

The stock ran from 21$ to 40$ after their Q3 earnings report so there should be no brainer that stock won't do the same again. **Like I already mentioned, that anything discussed on this DD is not an advice and its a personal opinion.**

$CRSR had a non-dilutive offering last week at $35 per share. This didn't add shares, just gave their initial PE firm a chance to cash out. With 7M shares sold at $35, this built a solid new ""floor"" for the stock on high volume at $35. Corsair has 36% short interest (obviously lower than GME), but the main IPO lock up period doesn't expire til March. Corsair's current available float is only 20% of total shares outstanding while short interest is 36%. Not a lot of shares available for shorts to cover if the stock starts moving against them.

&#x200B;

The Market Cap for this stock is \~3.31 B and their Revenue for Q4 is half of that? Insane. I'm likely expecting it to be way over the estimations above just like when they doubled expectations the quarter before. The floor for this is 35$ as shown by the past month and a half and It peaked at 51$.

https://valueofgrowth.com/recent-posts/f/the-3-best-stocks-to-watch-in-2021-with-huge-upside?blogcategory=stocks

**Summary**
TLDR version: Cloud/email/data security. Huge growth, recent acquisition, fair value estimate showing ~50% upside, earnings in 2 weeks at which point the fair value will likely increase even further as the recurring revenues from acquisitions and the continued growth push the data averages higher. 

**Positions**
Call volume for March-May expirys have been spiking, so that's where I'm at. Since the fair value is over $12, I'm buying $11 and $12 strikes.

**Harley Davidson DD- WILD HOGS🐖🚀🐖🚀**

WHO IS READY TO GO HOG WILD! Harley announced earnings and got spanked- no worries… we will go the moon.

If intellectually disabled (🐒) look at the TL;DR

**BULLISH SENTIMENT:**

Jochen Zeitz gives massive hope as a CEO and leader for HOG. The future is EV for the vehicle industry and motorcycles are no different. A niche market for powerful EV bikes has yet to be untapped and is what will push Harley Davidson into the future.

· he became CEO of Puma – making him the youngest ever CEO of a German company at the time – and turned the near-bankrupt business into one of the world's top three sports brands

· he now sits on the boards of Harley-Davidson, financial services company Cranemere, and the Kenya Wildlife Service, as well as running his own charitable foundation and co-chairing The B Team, a non-profit that he co-founded with Richard Branson in 2012 to promote sustainable business practices.

His previous ventures gave him a strong backing socially and experience with sustainable energy which is a must for Harley Davidson.

Touring and Large cruisers remain to be the biggest driver in profit and production for the company. Even through COVID-19 these remain steady. Introduction of their new bike, Pan-America Adventure Touring Motorcycle, is much more appealing to the younger crowd.

**ELECTRIC MOTORCYLES:**

Harley-Davidson is striving to be the leader in electric Motorcycles which will quickly set them apart from all other competitors and introduce a new segment of consumers for HOG. The executive staff is fully committed to a distinct product with go-to market strategies.

**BEARISH SENTIMENT:**

BOOMERS RIDE MOTORCYCLES XD

My opinion is that unless I can find compelling evidence that the squeeze is truly done for and off the table, my conviction has only grown stronger.

Most important things that stick out, all of which really build a case that must not be dismissed:

1) If shorts have covered, we should have noticed reasonable strong upwards momentum, as buying pressure consists of short covering along with retail buying, and a limited float.

2) Past few days we've seen trading volumes below average, likely suppressed demand caused by broker restrictions on buying. Lower volume can make any dump pull the price down easily. Especially when the demand side is getting locked out. Have to mention the timing of which Robinhood locked buying last week as well, coinciding with a massive dip.

3) Look at [this image](https://preview.redd.it/dralf2uks4f61.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=52223e916aacb4f65681da1cfe4f5e1ade7cea30)

Notice how AMC & GME have almost identical candlesticks, and the same is in the BB-NOK pair. It is undeniable that a lot of people are buying this stock and holding this stock. Not just in America but all across the world. We have global support.
You would think that with this many people in the trade (whether they are on the buying / selling side) we would see greater variance. This correlation to me looks like obvious manipulation by higher frequency and higher volume algorithmic trading.
It's hard to look at these charts and say that this is natural supply and demand. Seriously, same candlestick patterns on unrelated stocks. This price action is influenced by targeted manipulation to a high degree. Even if people were really selling off like crazy, wouldn't we see more natural candles?

4) We have mainstream media (MSM) covering the ""reddit mania"" extensively. MSM says reddit is trying to squeeze silver, which is false. You will not find anyone pushing to buy SLV on reddit. In fact, you will see a warning about silver and how many HFs have long positions in it.

5) We've seen an influx of bots on social media (reddit, FB, twitter) promoting silver, spamming that GME squeeze is finished, diverting attention away from the more uninformed audience. Why? If it's finished why the need for these?

6) MSM says the short squeeze mania is over and shorts have covered. If that is true, why are we seeing trade restrictions still on more and more brokers, and nonstop coverage all over TV and the internet. If it's over, why are there so many articles bashing retail to stay away?

7) GME is an outlier in the ""failed-to-deliver"" statistic, and has been put on NYSE short restriction (uptick rule). Something fishy is going on with the shares in the float.

8) SI% numbers are very conflicting. Especially the numbers that came around 30-50%. It was then later mentioned by someone in S3 that a different calculation was used. If you convert to the old calculation, you still get over 100% SI%. Why are they trying to change it all of a sudden?

To me, this is enough to say we're still in the game. If it's over, let them prove it by crushing GME to $20 and on February 9th we hear the official SI% being low. Then it's finished. Something tells me that it's not over, and this is all a ploy to mitigate the damage they are about to receive when GME eventually triggers the MOASS.

Can't say for sure it's a 100% trip to the moon and beyond, but what's really suggested otherwise? This whole misinformation campaign + price manipulation combo is too important to dismiss.

Remember I'm retard and please make your own financial decisions. This post is based on my observation and speculation.

Position 50 shares GME $210

So onto why the pheasant's FUD ended up only causing an hours long instead of perma brain damage.  BECAUSE HE IS A SMOOTH MOUTH BREATHER:

1. Fact one: Buying has been greater than selling. Buying has been greater than selling. Everyone knows that if we buy and hold, a payday will come at some point thanks to the hedgies continuing to double down on GME shorts.
2. Fact two: multiple stonks have mirrored movement.  See AMC for an example.
3. Fact three: Volume is too fucking low.  Volume was only 77mil today looking at RH.
4. Fact four: the hedgies aren't closing their positions, see #3.  There are no more shares available to short.
5. Fact five: I haven't gone FULL retard.  Never go FULL retard.

&#x200B;

My personal opinion is that we are never going to be able to build up enough momentum alone to turn this thing around.  But we don't have to.  We do not need momentum anymore, we just need to maintain scarcity of the shorted stocks.  Literally, just need to hold until the hedgies starts to close their positions, hold for as long as possible, then its all over.

This isn't a bubble, this isn't some overblown hype train, this is just the way of these meme stonks.

**TL/DR at the bottom**

I do not see nearly enough love for MGNI on r/stocks or WSB so I want to give you all a look in at a one-way ticket to gains.

**What does Magnite ($MGNI) do?**

\- **World’s largest independent supply-side advertising technology company**. This means they help fill advertising space, primarily on websites, apps, and **connected TV (CTV)** platforms. Price per share at time of writing: $40.20

**CTV -** Basically anything that is not cable TV is connected TV. Connecting through your xbox or roku or apple TV or however you want to stream TV. This is the **primary source of revenue** for $MGNI. Are you on the poor people version of Hulu that runs ads? Those ads run through MGNI.

So let me ask you - is there a movement towards cable TV, or a movement towards finding other ways to watch TV through streaming services? I think you know the answer. And that is reason #1 to buy in. **As CTV increases in popularity, so does demand for advertising space, and so does $MGNI revenue.**

**Industry comparison -**

Trade Desk ($TTD). TTD operates on the buy side of ad tech, so while not exactly the same, they are within the same industry. TTD is currently **up 2800%** over the last 4 years, with a market cap of $38.5 billion. Where is $MGNI? A shade under $5 billion. Now is it realistic to expect MGNI to be the next home run play like TTD (who my brother sold for $50/share, RIP)? Predicting anything to go up 2800% in 4 years is unlikely but who knows. But **if MGNI can get to even half the market cap of TTD, that is a price target of $160.** (Current: $40/share, Mcap 4.75 Billion)

**Past/future earnings:**

Past earnings and future earnings show the story of a company with fairly rapid growth. Take a look for yourself:

Q1 2020 Revenue - $36.3MM, up 12% YoY from Q1 2019

Q2 2020 Revenue - $42.3MM, up 12% YoY from Q2 2019

Q3 2020 Revenue - $61MM, up 62% YoY from Q3 2019

*Q4 2020 Revenue - Expected $72-75MM, up \~50% YoY from Q4 2019*

**$MGNI is up %335 in the past 12 mo, am I too late to the party?**

Answer: **NO,** and although I already outlined some reasons why above, here is a list for you:

&#x200B;

1. CTV will      only increase in popularity, which is where the bulk of MGNI revenue comes      from
2. $MGNI is      showing accelerated growth, great for a mid-cap company to try to make the      jump to large-cap
3. Trade Desk      (TTD), who is not a competitor but is in the same industry, is valued      nearly 10x higher than MGNI.
4. Earnings      coming up 2/24, which I expect MGNI to crush, and I do not think that      earnings are priced in yet.
5. Needham      analyst Laura Martin makes MGNI her top pick for 2021, saying 500% growth      is possible (Jan 13 [Why Wall Street analysts think Magnite may be the      next hot play in ad tech (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/why-wall-street-analysts-think-magnite-may-be-the-next-hot-play-in-ad-tech.html))
6. Survived a      short hit piece by Spruce Point Capital on Jan 8 (Thank you for a low      entry point for some calls)
7. **PR Today: Launch of “Unified Decisioning”,** a new MGNI product/software. From article:

*“Publishers are eager to tap into the efficiencies that programmatic provides without relinquishing the control they are used to when selling directly to buyers. Unified Decisioning enables them to do both and we’re excited to bring these capabilities to leading CTV publishers.”* Link: [*Magnite Introduces Open Beta of New CTV & OTT Solution Named Unified Decisioning | Business Wire*](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210202005138/en/Magnite-Introduces-Open-Beta-of-New-CTV-OTT-Solution-Named-Unified-Decisioning)

If you’re interested in companies that are trending from bottom-left to top-right, then I encourage you to invest in $MGNI. I believe it is a **good short-term play**; having just went on a weeklong dip from Jan 22 - Jan 29, I think you have a decent entry point here at $41.50, although I believe any entry point is fine at this stage in the company’s growth. Also in the short-term is earnings on 2/24 which I believe will be good for MGNI. It is also a **good long-term play** for reasons above, my EOY price target is $125, although it would not surprise me if it goes significantly higher. The $MGNI train hasn’t even left the station!

Positions: 100 shares @ $16, 2/19 35c x5, 2/19 40c x2, 2/19 45c x10, 2/19 50c x2 (Slight degeneracy)

**TL/DR:** MGNI is a growing company in the growing industry of advertising in (primarily) connected TV services (Think: Roku). Same realm as $TTD but 1/10th the market cap. Much room to grow. Earnings coming up 2/24 and Laura Martin’s stock pick of 2021. Just released beta of new software today.

AMC is a great stock anyway and after the pandemic it will naturally rise back up to $25/30 (I'm currently 50 shares deep at $9.50. (That's about a profit of $750 WORST CASE SCENARIO)

WSB/and other people who are helping us around the world, own collectively 5. Melvins hedgie buddy’s and paperhands own 1. 

Meanwhile, Melvin has to buy 9 bananas.  

Currently, the “market” is made up of hedgies swinging their banana around doing the helicopter (ladder attacks) and paperhands cracking under the pressure of “omg the price is so low 😫”

We unwaveringly want 50,000 for each banana and melvin doesn’t want to pay shit. Fortunately for us, they don’t have a choice. They HAVE to buy these bananas eventually.

Buying the dip accelerates the squeeze by taking the swinging/paper bananas out of the market, giving us greater control over the future price. This is because swinging their bananas around is super expensive. So, with every swing we make their banana just a little bit shorter 😉 Also, because they have to pay premiums on the bananas they owe and we don’t, time is on our side. Not theirs.

I'll start by explaining the difference between Box Office sales vs Streaming.  Streaming is like DVD sales, where the production company must sign over rights to the movie to the service which eliminates any chance at residuals such as Box Office sales which is where a majority of their profit lies.  My theory is that this is why we've only very few ""good"" movies recently, most of the production companies are sitting on their canned file waiting for COVID to be over.

Why I think AMC dropped the ball...  AMC, like other movie theaters already have agreements in place to share ""Box Office"" proceeds with the production companies.  I'm not sure why they wouldn't get creative and offer this same model up during COVID and get a leg up on their competition (Amazon, Google, etc...).  My guess, the same reason that I had to spend an hour doing DD just to find out that the only reason I could see them being viable into the future, they ALREADY had a product for and just don't do anything with.  Their leadership is completely incompetent and the company was being shorted into bankruptcy for a reason.

S3 and Ortex data are estimates, but FINRA data (from which the bimonthly official short interest reports are generated; this is the best there is) have shown that for the last five days, more than 50% of shares sold have been sold short:

[http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210202.txt](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210202.txt) (search GME; see also [2/1](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210201.txt), [1/29](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210129.txt), [1/28](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210128.txt), [1/27](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210127.txt))

[https://nakedshortreport.com/company/GME](https://nakedshortreport.com/company/GME) (pretty plot, though the data are slightly different from the official data given in the links above; both sources confirm that short volume has been > 50% total volume over the last five days, including today)

As an aside, according to that second website, [""if you see  more than 20% of your overall volume initiated short on a daily basis... you may be under \[a naked short\] attack.""](https://nakedshortreport.com/how-to-detect-short-trades) SEC, a little help, please?

In any case, the day before Robinhood and other brokers instituted the restriction on GME share and option buying was the last day that more than ***50%*** of *all GME shares sold* were not sold short. Shorts have been going in even harder on their shorting while they know buying is difficult for us. We win if we hold.

This is pretty definitive that shorts are causing the current crash, and they definitely haven't covered when doing so. It's mathematically impossible for shorts to cover if more than 50% of all shares sold in a day were sold short. Shorts are instead continuing to double down. GME will eventually rise, especially if Cohen and friends give some good news anytime soon (e.g., official company roadmap released, Cohen and friends buying the remaining shares they can, etc.). It will rise regardless of good news because shorts don't want to pay interest forever if a stock trades sideways. And as soon as all of us can buy an unlimited amount again, we can squeeze them once again.

I've shared FINRA data on here before and gotten some questions which have at this point become predictable, so I'm going to answer them below.

# Couldn't shorts open their position and cover by the end of the day?

No, because more than 50% of all shares were sold short, there were not enough shares for them to cover the shares they sold short even if every single share purchased other than a short share today was sold from a long to a short. It's mathematically impossible. They had to add at least around 10% of the total volume each of the last five days to their short position (most days had about 55% of shares sold short (some even more), and 100 - 55 = 45% not sold short; 55 - 45 = 10% more shares sold short than shares sold long). And I know that I bought more over each of the last few days, as did you glorious autists, so it was probably more than 10% of the total volume they were adding per day for each of the last five days.

# The total volume from those websites is less than the day's volume that my broker or another site tells me was traded

Yes, that's because FINRA only records data from specific markets/exchanges, not all of them. Although the total volume is less than what is sold over the entire market, the *ratio* of short sales to total shares sold is representative of the entire market, because they pull from the biggest exchanges. As mentioned above, FINRA is also the highest quality short data; the official bimonthly short data that is published is by FINRA pulling from these same data. These data are accurate.

&#x200B;

Edit to add: I am not a financial analyst and this is not financial advice. Make up your own mind about everything. Also, I am long GME. 

**TLDR:** Shorts have added a retardedly large amount of new short positions over the last five days.

I am unable to use emojis off my laptop so please excuse me for not having enough rocket ships but I promise you this rocket ship is fueling up and we are a couple months away from blast off if not sooner.

Why should you trust me?

I am an economics major with a concentration in entrepreneurship and a minor in sales. I love money more than hookers love blow and I intend on making a lot of money so I can afford the hookers that like blow. I go to a pretty prestigious university and I love how WallStreetBets can connect ""smart"" money with ""autist"" money. I am 100% all in on APHA with my entire life savings because as Warren Buffett would say, "" ""**Diversification** is a protection against ignorance,"" ""\[It\] makes very little sense for those who know what they're doing.""  and I know what I am doing so I full sent it.

&#x200B;

Why APHA?

They are conservative with their spending is what got me hooked first. Compared to other marijuana companies like ACB or Tilray, they aren't riddled with debt right off the back. (i'll get to the Tilray merger in a bit). This company has the cash on hand to purchase a MSO (multi-state operator) as soon as the US legalizes and my bet is that they are going to go for a MSO that has a heavy presence in Florida as the CFO stated in an AMA on reddit that Florida is where the market is, not California. The difference between APHA and any MSO or other LP is the fact that APHA merging with Tilray creates the first MCO or Multi-country operator. This means the company will be taking a piece of the cake from multiple cakes. You don't need to be #1 in America or Canada whenever you are directly engaged in multiple operations all over the world that increase your market share to be #1 worldwide.

&#x200B;

With APHA and Tilray merging... which stonk do you buy? Easy, APHA.

The arbitrage play has APHA being changed to .83 of 1 Tilray share.

Currently tilray trades at 24.95 x 0.83 = 20.708

The current APHA price? 15.25.

This means that the gap has to close before the merger but is Tilray going to go down with all the pro marijuana news coming out? No, APHA has to go up to close the gap and today alone APHA is up 17.92% based on pro marijuana legalization news. BUT WAIT! Tilray is up 22.98% which means the GAP IS ONLY GETTING WIDER just like your wife's pussy after letting her 5 boyfriends have a turn since you've been so busy focusing on your GME stonk going down due to market manipulation.

&#x200B;

The financials of APHA are strong, they FINALLY posted a profit of 0.01 EPS which may seem like little bitch shit but in reality most cannabis companies haven't hit profitability yet so they are ahead of the game. The one great thing about their financials is that Sweetwater Brewing wasn't factored into the earnings report which is AWESOME (Insert hellllaaa rocket emojis here). They are already turning a profit and THEN they are going to be adding more profits from a brewery that has strong revenue growth and turns a profit onto their balance sheet. While other companies have to figure out how to keep demand up after the holiday season, APHA has a raft to float on since Sweetwater provides a great level of float to the company. (I will post all relevant news articles at the end). The merge with Tilray makes this combined company a player in, Canada, Portugal, France, and then Sweetwater gives them US brand recognition. How does a beer company give US brand recognition? Look up the Sweetwater brand and you will see that this is a beer company for stoners and that is exactly what APHA needed. Right now the stock is stilling at $15 which is still relatively low, I can see this hitting anywhere from $50-75 EOY and like I said, I have my entire life savings in this stonk because I know the end of prohibition means the chance for the next Anheuser Busch which APHA is best positioned to become.

There's even more reasons to invest but I'm sure you get the point. This is going to be huge and if you're looking for a play in the marijuana sector this is your best option. Go on the weedstocks subreddit if you want even more verification or to see some alternative opinions. I made this post as a throwback to the good ole days to when WSB wasn't only about GME and AMC but also new emerging sectors. This is a great stock and I wouldn't have taken the time out of my busy schedule unless the time to blast off was fast approaching. Listen or don't I am gonna make tendies, I just want to share the wealth.

Sweetwater is actually a very big deal that is overlooked. They are expanding into more states which is simply creating a distribution chain for APHA/Tilray to distribute their product through. Imagine already having warehouses, sales reps, and shipping routes established before the US legalizes. APHA is going to be an MSO and MCO. The only thing that scares me is that democrats have said they don't want big companies coming in to sweep up market share whenever minorities have been directly impacted by the war on drugs. Could go both ways but Sweetwater provides somewhat of a foundation for the balance sheet and then the intrinsic value of the relationships/brand recognition that will already be established before any other LPs can get into the market will have APHA/Tilray the clear cut winner of the LPs. I strongly urge anyone that wants to get further into the marijuana investing space to visit the sub reddit Weedstocks rather than spamming WSB with these types of posts whenever their is a different sub dedicated to it. I have been a member of WSB and Weedstocks for over a year and both subs have their pros and cons.

What comes to mind when you think of BlackBerry? Phones? Your a chump if you answered phones.

TLDR up front, BlackBerry has pivoted away from making phones and instead is in the software sector. Some big names that they have include, [SpaceX](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=0&article=1737&context=smallsat&type=additional), [Amazon](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/blackberry-and-amazon-web-services-partner-on-ivy-tech-for-your-car/), **Nvidia**, **NIO**, **Xpeng**, **Ford** and 19 out of the 25 EV companies now use QNX. (*New info as of 2/2/21 at bottom*)

**Software**

BlackBerry has gone away from the phones business and has reinvented itself to become the main player in Automobile OS systems. They have lock and key in this market since many OEMs don't want to start from the ground up making the software themselves. As of June,2020 they have the QNS software in over[175 million cars](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-175-million-vehicles-301081594.html). Nvidia uses BlackBerries QNX for the base of its [self-driving car](https://channeldailynews.com/news/nvidia-to-build-its-ai-self-driving-platform-on-blackberry-qnx/58048). Sony is also partners with Nvidia and BlackBerry for the car they are [making.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/) Not to mention the companies that use QNX are subscription based, so reoccurring revenue. This is speculation on this part but Hyundai is using QNX and has partnered with Apple, and carplay is a layer built on QNX.

**Fundamentals**

BlackBerry recently just sold all of there phone [patents](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-sells-90-patents-to-huawei-covering-key-smartphone/) to Huawai showing that they are no longer in the phone sector. Big Boys have been adding more BB to there pockets and the last 13F was on the 15th (1/15/21) (Fin---tel)

[https://gyazo.com/d9894e59a75885c1506dd3a2ef576ebe](https://gyazo.com/d9894e59a75885c1506dd3a2ef576ebe) 

I had pictures to show it but the braindead bot removed it.

Other big short inst---itutions have a hard on for keeping this low, BB was in the top 20 most shorted stocks but GME was number 1. Just this Friday(1/15) Shorts and inst---itutions sold alot.

The **50 dayMA crossed the 200dayMA** in December and has held since then. Also check out that 188million green.

Morningstar and CFRA both put $BB with a fair value price of 6.40, so you can assume that is the absolute bottom. (copied from [u/ThegreatLoudini](https://www.reddit.com/u/ThegreatLoudini/))

**(New Info 2/2/21)**

Black Berry Call volume is [exceedingly high](https://twitter.com/ACInvestorBlog/status/1356314928446103554?s=09) this month, possible that the big boys know something?

InvestorPlace [recommended](https://investorplace.com/2021/02/theres-potential-in-bb-stock-even-without-a-reddit-squeeze/?mod=mw_quote_news) this stock as a ""Buy recommendation in my portfolio grader""

[Amazons Q4 earnings report mentioned that they have a multi year deal to use BB Ivy.](https://preview.redd.it/k6y9b5edq5f61.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7d8154ca0a5d42b2d0e6ce171e7ecdbde1abd9b)

I know short term meme stocks seem to be all the rage these days, but I believe the real tendies are being produced from the cannabis sector. 

MSOS (Cannabis ETF) is up 6% today and has already gone up \~25% on the year. Basically all the cannabis stocks have been exploding these past few months. I don't see this growth slowly down anytime soon and here are some reasons why.

* Both the **US and Mexico** are closing in on **federally legalizing cannabis**. Both of these countries are going to offer huge markets that will combine to be far bigger than Canada's current market.
* **More people are doing the 420**. Usage is going up everywhere and I don't see it dropping in the near future.
* Lots of cannabis companies are **getting majorly shorted** which is keeping their stock price down instead of going to the MOOOON 🚀🚀

Wouldn't be a fair DD without some risks though.....

* Although **US and Mexico** are strongly considering federal legalization, it **could still go south**. Backlash from legalizing or more important and pressing issues could easily push it to the back-burner or kill the idea all together for the near future.
* Although many health studies are coming out listing the benefits of cannabis, if some **serious health side-effects** come out in some studies it could scare people away from smoking the weed.
* There are far too many companies and lots of them are going to go **bankrupt** probably. Lots of room to get unlucky in your choices.

So what cannabis stonks should I be YOLOing into? A better first question might be: What should I be looking for in a cannabis stock?.

* **Profitable or near it:** Once the market really explodes it is going to be the companies with the cleanest balance sheets that are going to be able to make the big moves and print the real tendies. The companies with piles of debt and minimal profit will be left in the dust.
* **Has a foothold in multiple countries:** The more countries, states, licenses, land, etc., the better. All of these will allow for a head-start in the markets in that area.
* **Undervalued:** with lots of the cannabis stocks getting shorted to death, there are some cannabis stocks out there that I believe are extremely undervalued.

So what are your recommendations Mr. Smooth Brain?

* **APHA:** Tilray and Aphria are in the works of a serious and huge merger that will see them becoming one of (if not the biggest) cannabis company. Aphria's financials continue to be promising and Tilray's are not as solid but still decent. Aphria also acquired SweatWater giving them a solid start on cannabis related beverages. Aphria is the largest cannabis producer in Canada at 12.2% ([source](https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235)).  
So why APHA and not TLRY? When APHA and TLRY merge APHA shares will be .83 of a TLRY share. Because of this it is safe to assume APHA share price should = 0.83 x TLRY share price. TLRY share price is currently $25 which would mean that APHA share price should be around $20. For this reason APHA price being $15 right now is a steal assuming the merger goes through (looking promising for the merger to happen in Q2 this year).  

* **FIRE.TO/SPRWF:** I know what you are thinking.... ""this gay boomer bear smooth brain thinks a penny stock is a good idea!?!"".... hear me out. Supreme cannabis is one of those companies that never quite reached potential in the initial Canadian cannabis boom. Never had a real profitable quarter and has since been crushed to the ground by shorts ([source](https://shortdata.ca/stock/FIRE.TO/)). It has mostly been treated as just a dead stock and over the last few months people have dumbed on me for even mentioning this stock.  
I believe this is all about to turn around though. Supreme is having an earnings call on February 11th where I expect an extremely promising financial report and exciting upcoming news. Considering how undervalued this stock is (97 million market cap) it isn't going to take much to get this stock exploding. Volume and shorts have been exploding in this stock which shows huge promise. Supreme also makes up 3% of cannabis retail market in Canada ([source](https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235)). They also have connections in Australia and Israel markets.  


There are many more promising cannabis stonks out there and I encourage my fellow smooth brains to do their DD. Companies operating in multiple states are a safe bet ([check out this](https://www.greenmarketreport.com/the-cannabis-industrys-top-12-u-s-multi-state-operators/)). Also large companies like Canopy Growth, Curaleaf, etc. should all be decent stocks. If you are a retard interested in penny stocks check out FAF.TO and HITIF (along with SPRWF of course). 

Lots are coming out with earnings in the next few weeks, so keep your eyes out and remember to exercise those  💎🙌

My positions: APHA 20@$7, SPRWF 4480@$0.13, (I know... r/babystreetbets)..... I plan on dumping more into APHA and doubling down on SPRWF after earnings come out.

**TLDR**: Cannabis STONKS  🚀🚀🚀🚀. Exercise your 💎🙌 and HOLD. IMO buy APHA and risk it on SPRWF, but do your own DD on cannabis stonks."|2021-02-02 20:42:41.183949|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_204247.csv|DueDiligence|['TONKS']|[]|['I', 'I', 'MSOS', 'I', 'US', 'I', 'OOOON', 'DD', 'US', 'I', 'A', 'I', 'I', 'APHA', 'TLRY', 'APHA', 'TLRY', 'APHA', 'TLRY', 'APHA', 'TLRY', 'TLRY', 'APHA', 'APHA', 'FIRE', 'I', 'FIRE', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'DD', 'FAF', 'TO', 'HITIF', 'SPRWF', 'APHA', 'SPRWF', 'I', 'I', 'APHA', 'SPRWF', 'TONKS', 'HOLD', 'IMO', 'APHA', 'SPRWF', 'DD']|['FAF']

A lot of retards made their first trade with GME. Awesome and welcome!

With inexperience come a lot of psychological phallacies that Funds are exploiting:

# BUY LOW SELL HIGH.

*The. Core. Principal. Of. Trading.*

You never, ever sell when down. You don't. If you sell at loss you're literally **BUYING HIGH AND SELLING LOW!!!** If you don't 100% NEED this money RIGHT FUCKING NOW. Do. Not. Sell. It would be more entertaining literally burning money then selling at artificially low prices. NO ONE IS FORCING YOU TO SELL. If you're getting nervous about LOSSES ----> DONT LOOK AT THE STOCK. DELETE YOUR APP. DO NOT GET STRESSED AND EMOTIONAL. You are not acting rationally when emotions get involved in trading. NEVER SELL EMOTIONALLY. Emotions are your enemy in trading and you WILL LOSE MONEY. If you're emotionally attached to your invested money, try avoiding any further trades until you're set up where you can (emergency fund, tax advantaged accounts etc. can help you feeling more secure).

It's negative today, it may be negative tomorrow. The DD still stands. GME as a company is in the spotlight of the world. It has a future.

Even if there will be no short squeeze. DO NOT SELL AT LOSS. WAIT. 1 year, 3 years, 10 years. WHATEVER. It can get green again. IT CAN AND IT MAY. If you sell at loss, it wont.

I KNOW THIS IS NO TYPICAL WSB (NON) ADVICE, BUT WITH SO MANY FUCKING RETARDS JUMPING IN WITH NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT THEIR DOING IT NEEDS TO BE SAID.

Some more autistic shit

# Percieved Value:

Remember when you bought your shares. Let's say you bought at $300. You made the decision that this stock, its potential and emotional value, is worth $300 to you and you bought.

Now the Price is artificially driven down. The beginning value hasn't changed. No one says that stock is worth less, unless you do. Unless you yourself decide that you're willing to sell at a lower price.

When selling at $100 -> YOU ARE SAYING IT'S WORTH THIS LITTLE. YOU DECIDE AT WHAT PRICE YOU'RE WILLING TO SELL. If you don't WANT to sell at $100 WAIT TILL YOU CAN SELL IT TO FUCKING MELVIN AT $6000.

Plus: Loss Aversion

A loss of 10% is emotionally more powerfull than a gain of 10%. They are preying on this effect to bring you to make an emotional decision to PANIC and sell at loss. WHICH ONLY MAKES SENSE IF YOUR GOAL IS TO LOSE MONEY.

&#x200B;

HOLD TODAY

HOLD TOMORROW

HOLD FOREVER

IF YOU NEED THE MONEY, WAIT FOR IT TO FUCKING TURN GREEN YOU IMBECILE.

&#x200B;

THIS IS JUST A DELUSIONAL AUTISTIC FUCK SPEAKING AND NO FINANCIAL ADVICE.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

Since WSB became a fucked up game of finding an imposter -> I was active on WSB a while ago on a different account (MICRON, early AMD) and since moved to subs like /r/financialindependence /r/FIRE etc. and switched to low-cost index funds and mainly stick to this kind of investments and kept an eye on WSB for enterntainment. This account has since been deleted by me because friends of mine (and coworkers) got ahold of that accounts username. I had some history that was too personal for them to know about.

I only moved onto the GME bandwagon out of spite, the moment BUY's got blocked on RH. This is the only and last ""WSB"" move I'm gonna do. 

It doesn't have any meaning as I could write whatever, but my username is my job in the banking sector. I know people that work in HF's, used to work decades in HF's. I didn't quite believe what they told me about the possibilities they have. But now I do.

Buy low, sell high is the foundation of any trade you do. Even GME. 

If you thought this move would be a quick buck over a few days, no. If you bought after the surge, it just doesn't make ANY sense selling. NONE. You cut your potential of any breakeven, ever.

Even if the short squeeze wouldn't happen due to highly illegal tactics by HF, GameStop has way more potential now than before. The company is in international spotlight, has an easy way to raise capital after the trade still, has global logistics... It still has potential as a company, if you sell now, you lose out on any chance of ever covering that loss."|2021-02-02 20:42:41.183949|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_204245.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['A', 'GME', 'BUY', 'LOW', 'SELL', 'HIGH', 'UYING', 'HIGH', 'AND', 'LLING', 'LOW', 'NEED', 'RIGHT', 'CKING', 'NOW', 'NO', 'ONE', 'IS', 'RCING', 'YOU', 'TO', 'SELL', 'OSSES', 'DONT', 'LOOK', 'AT', 'THE', 'STOCK', 'ELETE', 'YOUR', 'APP', 'DO', 'NOT', 'GET', 'ESSED', 'AND', 'IONAL', 'NEVER', 'SELL', 'NALLY', 'WILL', 'LOSE', 'MONEY', 'DD', 'GME', 'DO', 'NOT', 'SELL', 'AT', 'LOSS', 'WAIT', 'TEVER', 'IT', 'CAN', 'AND', 'IT', 'MAY', 'I', 'KNOW', 'THIS', 'IS', 'NO', 'PICAL', 'WSB', 'DVICE', 'BUT', 'WITH', 'SO', 'MANY', 'CKING', 'TARDS', 'MPING', 'IN', 'WITH', 'NO', 'CKING', 'CLUE', 'WHAT', 'THEIR', 'DOING', 'IT', 'NEEDS', 'TO', 'BE', 'SAID', 'YOU', 'ARE', 'AYING', 'S', 'WORTH', 'THIS', 'ITTLE', 'YOU', 'ECIDE', 'AT', 'WHAT', 'PRICE', 'RE', 'LLING', 'TO', 'SELL', 'WANT', 'WAIT', 'TILL', 'YOU', 'CAN', 'SELL', 'IT', 'TO', 'CKING', 'ELVIN', 'AT', 'A', 'PANIC', 'WHICH', 'ONLY', 'MAKES', 'SENSE', 'IF', 'YOUR', 'GOAL', 'IS', 'TO', 'LOSE', 'MONEY', 'HOLD', 'TODAY', 'HOLD', 'ORROW', 'HOLD', 'REVER', 'IF', 'YOU', 'NEED', 'THE', 'MONEY', 'WAIT', 'FOR', 'IT', 'TO', 'CKING', 'TURN', 'GREEN', 'YOU', 'ECILE', 'THIS', 'IS', 'JUST', 'A', 'IONAL', 'ISTIC', 'FUCK', 'AKING', 'AND', 'NO', 'NCIAL', 'DVICE', 'WSB', 'I', 'WSB', 'ICRON', 'FIRE', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'RH', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'ANY', 'NONE', 'HF']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'RH', 'GME']

I used Python to download Yahoo! Finance's data via their Python package (source code at the bottom to plot out all volume and short interest).  


Here is why I think selling is terrible:  
Looking at the current week, we see a lot of puts below the $100 strike price:

[Yeah so what?](https://preview.redd.it/wu2mxamgr5f61.png?width=1783&format=png&auto=webp&s=880716c405c8dccea70a7397efee84bbae895d4a)

This seems obvious but why does that matter? Well it means people are betting this will go down, and not just below $100, but a lot of them are betting it will go down to sub $30 levels! We also have ton of people thinking it will skyrocket to $800 as seen in some other posts (do with this what you will).

This seems like a pretty bearish outlook and doesn't give much hope, but take a look at the following week:

[That confident?](https://preview.redd.it/1dmkly46s5f61.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6077ec26ad476c234ba9dfa2dc617cd05e97452)

Everyone thinks GME is now worth less than $30 less than 1-week later. That is some horseshit if I ever smelled it. I am not one to believe in conspiracy theories and neither should you, but if I were short GME right now, I am betting GME will die come next Monday. 

After all that initial DD and GME's positive long term outlook, people are betting 3,000,000 shares GME is basically going bankrupt.

This is and always has been a long play IMO. GameStop isn't going anywhere anytime soon and if you think it is such a bad company that it will fall to sub-$30 levels than give those shares up to people who believe in this companies transformation and PERSEVERANCE through the years and through COVID.

Positions: 250 @ $240 and holding not because why not, but because this company is actually good. I will buy more after my funds clear.

Listen up retards,

Many of you are probably looking for a new direction from which tendies may fly. Well do I have a solution for you. It’s a big reverse course from the boomer dinner this sub ate over the past few weeks.

Yes my friends, I propose aggressive call options/long positions on the Airline industry, specifically Delta. Here’s why:

Past:

\- Going back to a report by Forbes, [Delta ranks best](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurabegleybloom/2020/07/27/covid-report-best-worst-airlines-coronavirus/?sh=48b3b5ff13af) in terms of cleanliness during COVID, meaning prevailing sentiment among travelers is high right now.

Present:

\- Delta is the [last major airline not filling middle seats](https://news.delta.com/delta-only-us-airline-block-middle-seats-limit-onboard-capacity-through-march-30-2021#:~:text=Delta%20will%20continue%20delivering%20on,now%20through%20March%2030%2C%202021), thereby spacing passengers out. 

\- This is good because, again it improves customer safety/feeling of safety during flights

\- This also means that they have been seating fewer passengers throughout the pandemic, while total profits have remained largely equal with their major competitors

\- Tighter self-imposed restrictions may mean fewer international restrictions, but this is more speculative than anything

Future:

\- Expects to hit profitability by July

\- Pandemic expense cuts to older aircraft should present a $400m decrease to annual costs, even when considering a ramp up in overhead as traffic increases

\- Delta expects at least 70% of their large corporate clients to return by the end of the year

Those final 2 points are from their last earning call, which means… well of course theyd be bullish on themselves, but if its to be believed, then Delta is ready to come out of the pandemic strong. With a mix of leisure travel skyrocketing, business travel returning to some extent, and the holidays leading to a traffic spike right in time for Jan 2022 calls, I’m thinking of going hog deep in 65c at $1.61 a piece.

My main price suppressing factor is that [children aren't expected to receive the COVID Vaccine](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/children-coronavirus-vaccine-late-2021-experts/story?id=73364817) until late 2021. If children can’t get the vaccine then families cannot travel. I'm banking a lot here on the vast majority of Americans getting the vaccine in time for Christmas. As a result my theory leads me to the Jan 2022 options, rather than the Sep ones, as the holiday rush will play out before they expire.

TLDR:

Plane no fly good now, but stock not so bad. When plane fly more, stock more better."|2021-02-02 20:42:41.183949|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_204247.csv|DueDiligence|['DD']|[]|['I', 'I', 'COVID', 'COVID']|[]

Feb 5 100p had the highest volume today at 22k with 7k OI, call volumes don't even compare. Like it or not in general people are bearish on the stock and the fact that 100P is now pretty deep ITM doesn't bode well for the stock. What we are experiencing is pretty much a gamma squeeze but downwards. 

That halt today was pretty bullshit because we were on the way up above 100  and an IV crush on OTM $100 puts would've given us some momentum upward. But no it just had to happen on the way up. 

Anyways this week looks pretty bearish and it is possible we could dump some more if we don't take back 100. I've been wrong before and I hope I'm wrong again. Keep diamond handing though, MM has been fucking with us by jacking up the price of options to make it harder for us to buy and profit from this. They can't do this forever and in fact, I've been profiting by selling OTM puts at great prices while holding onto my shares, I know theta gang isn't welcome here but what could be better than getting paid to hold gme at discount prices? or selling puts to expire worthless to GME bears?  

Anyways as soon as IV dies down, which could take a while, it's time to start buying YOLO  FD call options again.

The interest rate on your shorts goes through the roof and you are about to go bankrupt. What do you do? First you up your fire power by bringing in funds. Then you vilify your enemies, telling the world that they are the problem, not you. Then you stop the squeeze by putting a throttle on demand side. Then you divert the money to side show securities that will actually raise your bottom line.  


What next? You still have to pay back the shares. You are not going to get it cheap. How do we limit it? I could buy cheap way OTM call options knowing that when we start to cover, the price is going to explode because the diamond handed apes won't be selling for cheap. How do you maximize this? 

1) you need a cheap OTM call. Since 2 weeks ago, the highest call was 160, and last week was 320, they weren't far enough out of the money to be cheap. 

2) to make it cheaper, you need it to look like the squeeze has squoze, and gain as many shares from paper hands on the way down. Lowering the price per share on the call options. 

3) purchase enough OTM calls to cover your short position after it explodes. Locking in your price to cover at 800 per share max.   


Proof:   
[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options/)  
Here we can see that there is a volume of 28,493 call options purchased. Holy shit...

That is 2.85 million shares. 2.28 Billion dollars worth at that strike price. 

With the volume of trades as it rises to that point, plus the volume of those calls, they could bring their short positions low enough to complete the squeeze.  


Who is left holding the bag? HF will mostly hold the bag. Seeing as they will be paying 2.28 Billion dollars at least. Then the real bag holders will be the writers of the call options. They will have to purchase the shares raising the price above 800 due to a gamma squeeze. 

TL;DR: I believe hedge funds have gotten rid of their risk of having to pay the 10k per share we think is reasonable to a max of 800 by purchasing way out of the money calls, and writers of call options will be the biggest bag holders in history.   


Guys I'm just a retard that has never professionally traded, I don't know shit about shit. I'm holding on to my stocks, and they will have to pry them out of my cold dead diamond hands. Don't listen to this. It's not financial advice.

First off, to all of you diamond handing this stock, god damn I love you apes.

Now listen up and listen closely. GME is still on a moon mission and its launch is imminent. I've seen some fantastic DD here that is far beyond my analytical skills and I thank you all for that because god knows I can't read so the charts help.

This break down is going to be consist of something we tend to lack here, and that my friends, is logic.

So lets get into it. 

This past week has seen GME hit an ATH followed by a steep decline due to market manipulation tactics and the media turning against us at presumably the hand of the hedge funds we stand to hurt the most. We have seen hit pieces on GME, misdirection, and blatant lies regarding the analytics and reporting of statistics on GME. Countless media outlets have claimed that GME has squeezed already and its over! Its done! Move on and move back in with your wife's boyfriend!

But they are wrong.

Think of this from a surface level and look at the big picture. This entire week was a setup for shorts to mitigate their losses which they knew they would incur regardless. First, we saw a price spike that opened up options far, far OTM.  Out to 800 fucking dollar calls. Then, we saw a steep decline in price along with a fundraiser for shorts in the form of SLV being pushed by shills. Following this we saw massive purchases of these OTM 800c yesterday once premiums and IV were reduced. So what does this mean? Hedges set themselves up to mitigate how much they'll lose in hopes of just avoiding bankruptcy while giving their associates a chance to profit even greater on the impending squeeze. 

Now why would it come this week if a lot of the calls are dated out to March you ask? Apparently, and I don't know this for fact, but Fintel will update GME's short interest officially as of next Tuesday, February 9th. If this is true, and short interest is still over 100%, this will confirm that media outlets were bought and paid for by hedges along with their misdirection, thus causing even further public outrage, and another mass buying of GME to get in on the squeeze that is still coming. 

However, if hedges knock the price down as far as possible and trigger the squeeze this week, they will have effectively hedged their bets with calls, shaken out as many paper hands as possible, and stopped delaying the inevitable, all while leaving the media outlets they paid off, now holding the metaphorical bag of lost public trust, all while mitigating their losses to the fullest extent. 

Essentially, if the short interest is still outstanding and above 100%, shorts would fuck themselves even further by allowing an official report of this to come out and they know it. 

We go the moon soon my fellow apes. Good luck and God speed. See you at 10,000.

This is NOT financial advice and I AM and APE.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Hedges have mitigated their losses and have screwed buyers and the media outlets they've bought. When official short interest reports come out, they'll be outed as liars and the retail retaliation will send us even further to the moon than if they just let it happen prior to these reports."|2021-02-02 20:42:41.183949|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_204245.csv|DueDiligence|['GME', 'THIS']|['GME']|['TDLR', 'I', 'GME', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'ATH', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'OTM', 'SLV', 'OTM', 'IV', 'I', 'GME', 'NOT', 'I', 'AM', 'APE']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

That's fucking AWESOME that DFV is still in and is holding with his diamond dong, but first things first, he cashed out $13M along the way and has been very transparent on this. What's losing $20M if you're up $40M? 

&#x200B;

DFV is why a lot of retail investors entered the market. DFV never intended for this to hit as high as it did and that's apparent in his positions, he thought GME was heavily shorted and had a lot of potential, but there's no way he thought it would lead to short squeeze 1k+ territory. 

HE IS NOT THE NUMBERS BEHIND THIS AND ""I"" NEED TO THINK FOR MYSELF

""I"" need to stop making him a martyr for this sub for the day he eventually sells. The SEC is probably watching him like a hawk and I'm assuming that's a big reason that he's still in even though it's in his long play.

Given the massive red days we've seen twice this week I'd really recommend giving it a read. But the one point that's important, and point of this post is:

* Cohen still has a contract to buy another 7% of Shares

He currently owns around 13%, and is restricted to owning no more than 20% as part of an agreement. Obviously he wouldn't want to exercise that right when the price is $350, and he has until the end of 2022 to do it, but if he thinks $100 is the new Floor, or around there, wouldn't this be the best time for him to do so?

Every single one of his share purchases in the past have been about sending a message. Why not this one too?

You're all shouting Wall St is preventing the MOASS through manipulative actions (they definitely are). However you're all losing sight of why the short squeeze was even possible in the first place and pissing your pants wetting your paper hands in the process.

**We didn't invest in GME because the shorts were over 140% of the float and wanted to punish Wall St**

If any of you autists actually did some DD or even watched some of DFV's videos, you'll realize that GME was a value play, *the short squeeze was just the cherry on top*. I have seen over the past two weeks, a huge gaslighting effort from billionaires on TV (and unintentionally reddit users pushing only the MOASS), getting you to believe that Gamestop's value is from the short squeeze. What everyone forgot is how valuable of a company Gamestop is now.

**So what changed about Gamestop?**

In Nov 2020 Ryan fking Cohen joined Gamestop's Board. Who is Ryan Cohen? This is the guy who built Chewy from the ground up, he was in all respects, able to build a Pet e-commerce empire and directly compete with **Amazon**. Not only did Ryan join the board, but he was able to bring along with him Chewy's COO/CMO and CFO. You know who else is on the board? Reggie Fils-Aimé, the previous President of Nintendo Americas. If you don't know Reggie, you definitely know his face. So now you know Gamestop is poised for a shakeup, Ryan didn't join the Board and bring with him two other people because he thought Gamestop was going to get squozed, he did it because he understands there is a lot of money to be made here.

**Valuation**

I'm not going to pretend I'm an expert in valuing companies. Properly evaluating a company purely based on financials does not work in today's market anymore, but to appease the F people.

Here are some facts:

Critics argue brick and mortar retail, and as a result Gamestop, is dying. While they aren't wrong, they fail to also address that Gamestop had **300% YoY growth in e-commerce sales**. Gamestop is also actively shutting down stores and rebranding existing ones as experience centers. Physical Gamestop stores are going to be where all you autists hang out when you're outside of your rooms.

Gaming is huge, anyone who argues otherwise is living under a rock. As cringe as it was, Ninja hosting the NYC ball drop is testament to this. Singular game titles like Fortnite and Minecraft are worth billions alone. The gaming industry itself is worth nearly **$200 Billion** and slated to grow double digits YoY.

[There is a great DD written by a VC on why Gamestop is going to the moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/)

>This market cap (matching industry standards) should for an appropriate valuation for a growth stock be $50B.....This is why the short squeeze is distracting many. In 5 years if you diamond hands this company, the fair value of shares can range from $800-$2400 and not be in any sort of bubble or unjustified by fundamentals speculation.

To repeat that, based on fundamentals alone (nothing to do with a short squeeze), GME per share could be worth $800 conservatively, or $50 Billion. Chewy at this time is worth roughly $40 Billion in a smaller market, Pet products vs Gaming.

So polish your paper hands and turn them into fking diamonds. There is nothing Wall St can do can make you sell. And when this company starts turning itself around, you'll have been at the ground floor. 

**TL:DR Gamestop not worth nothing if shorts not squoze. Everyone wants you to believe it so you can sell now. Gaming is huge, Gamestop is positioning itself to be big.** 

P.S. For all you retards, everyday you hold your shares is another day Melvin and co need to pay interest. Hold your stocks for at least a year, and you even get to pay long term capital gains tax as opposed to short term counts as ordinary income.

Due to the massive losses to the hedges. Why wouldn’t a couple of hedges. Once they have covered. Start massively going long in order to start a massive squeeze to get rid of all the other hedges that are still short. (Still a large short interest) It would only take a small push I think from some big hedges to kickstart the perpetual upward rise.  Retail would join in. The whales are already in.  They would then bail when the squeeze is sqoze and their competition is gone. 

Why would they do this. 
1. It gets rid of the competition 
2. It minimises their losses from the previous shorts. If done right it could actually make them profit. 

Why wouldn’t they do this
1. It would make retail think they won and were right.  Cant have the little guy declaring victory. Is pride more important than money to these despicable miscreants. 

If this is correct then those holding could be rewarded by the hedges.  It would also explain why there was $25m in $800 3/19 calls.

Gotta combat some of this shit.

I keep seeing so many posts around here about this squeeze and that the 2008 VW squeeze are totally the same. Or that in 2008 the VW squeeze happened with a much smaller short position. 

They are not the same full stop and the VW squeeze didn't have a smaller short position.

First and foremost I'm holding 9 shares at an avg cost of $352.00 I'm still in it but all the shit DD needs to stop. 

Sorry if this hurts your feelings.

So first and foremost just because they are both short squeezes does not mean they are going to behave the same. Part of the reason for this is the suprise and speed at which the VW squeeze happened to funds.

Second and the main part of this post. The short position was not actually smaller in VW. I'll explain. 

In 2008 the VW short squeeze happened causing VW to become the most valued company on the entire NYSE. The reason for this situation is similar to the current situation there were more shorts out than shares to cover. 

Now I already hear your stupid screeching ""BUT IS WAS ONLY 12 PERCENT SHORT!!!""

Now I'm sure you had to kick off your shoes and socks to count that high and really I'm proud but here is the whole story.

Porsche had quietly bought nearly 75% of the company. This was done in a few sneaky ways but ultimately that's what happened.

Now before this there were only 45% of the shares available anyways due to Porsche having an existing 30% stake various index funds 5% and finally 20% covered by the german government.

To break it down 30+20+5 = 55% already owned. and 13 percent or so short.

Now let's add in Porsche's new stake 75+20+5=95%

And since these shares are now bought by people who have no interest or in some cases no ability to sell we there is a 13% short position on only about 5% of trading shares.

The final catalist was VW issuing a statement to the shorts letting them know they were super duper fucked. Like you forgot to pick up your wife's birth control and now your rasing her boyfriends son levels of fucked.

This caused the short squeeze from hell.

Now as to our current dilemma. Nothing is guaranteed to behave the same however if the shorts have not closed their positions sufficiently this might happen again. So good news for we big dick diamond hand fuckers if that is the case. But anyone who this is your first time at this shit know that you might be about to learn a painful fucking lesson that just because 2 similar things happen it doesn't mean shit.

Listen up retards,

I know BlAcKbErRy make phones is a solid meme, but I think it is actually a very worthwhile investment regardless of the current hype (or lack thereof) around the stock.

BlackBerry Spark was launched just earlier last year and so far is winning some decent contracts. I think it has plenty of room to grow. As governments and countries start to connect more with the internet due to covid or just technology advancing cybersecurity solutions will be more relevant. I think BB has positioned itself to be a solid choice.

The United States Airforce in September selected BlackBerry Spark “for their secure productivity needs.”

They “won” the patent infringement lawsuit against Facebook, so that payout should be coming at some point. I know the stock already jumped because of the news, but still being able to uphold their patents means in the future they can sue more people for infringement and make more money.

Blackberry is out of the cell phone game which is good for them I think their software and security was really what made the phones popular to begin with so now they can focus more on that. (Also they are the largest patent holders in Canada not sure if that a really that important though)

Also I think the CEO is very motivated to make it work with 5 million in shares being locked up until the stock can reach $16-20 over a 10-day trading average. Also the sweet sweet $90 mill if he can get the stock to $30 before November of 2023.

*Redefining gaming, eSports, and streaming*

Company Overview

Corsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California.

They acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market, Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom-built PC systems and console controllers markets, respectively, and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam, and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market.

Corsair went public on September 23, 2020, with its IPO priced at $17, valuing the company at about $1.3B.

Understanding the Business

**Value Proposition**

Corsair provides specialized, high-performance gear for gamers and streamers. Their products are designed to provide speed and reliability for competitive gaming, high quality content for streamers, and powerful PC components that allows gamers to run modern games smoothly.

**Revenue Streams**

Currently, Corsair groups its product offering into two segments: gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems.

Gamer and Creator Peripherals:

which represents around 25% of net revenue, includes gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets, streaming gear, and high performance console controllers.

Gaming Components Systems:

which represents around 75% of net revenue includes computer cases, power supply units (PSU), high performance memory products (40% of net revenue), and custom-built gaming systems.

Acquisitions and Partnerships:

During 3Q 2020 Corsair acquired Gamer Sensei, a gaming coaching platform, EpocCam, an app that allows iPhones to serve as a webcam, and partnered with Pipeline, a course-based education platform for streamers.

Industry

**Market Size**

According to Jon Peddie Research, the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach $40B by the end of 2020. Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.

Additionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.

**Industry Fundamentals**

Growth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.

Popularity of gaming is increasing:

According to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.

Tech-driven improvements in game quality:

Advances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.

Increasing gaming and streaming engagement:

Some interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks’ State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:

* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games
* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves
* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive
* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.

**The eSports and streaming flywheel**

The rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.

Competitive Landscape & Risks

**Competition**

The gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair’s product offering includes:

**Gaming keyboards and mice** \- Logitech and Razer

**Headsets and related audio products** \-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX

**Streaming gear** \- Logitech and AVerMedia

**Performance controllers** \- Microsoft and Logitech

**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake

**High performance memory** \- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron

**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower

**Competitive Strategy**

The company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.

**Market Share**

According to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.

**Growth Strategy**

Move into the Asia Pacific region:

The Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.

Complimentary acquisitions:

Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.

New Markets:

Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.

**Threat of New Entrants**

Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).

**Threat of Substitution**

A significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair’s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.

Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user’s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.

According to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.

Additionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.

**Moats**

There does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair’s market share across their product offering.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

[Here is a blog entry](https://stu2b50.dev/posts/why-robinhood-d3580b) attempting to explain the calculation.

As far as I understand, the situation is like this.  RH needs to maintain an amount of cash (maybe with DTCC, but possibly just separately within RH since they have their own clearing house) that, with 99% probability, will cover the entirety of the cash needed to cover their unsettled T+2 positions.  This is generally much smaller than the actual buy volume on a given day because the amount that's due two days later is max(vol_buy - vol_sell, 0).  Let's call this the net buy volume (NBV).  In a situation where RH is buying and selling in an unbiased way, this would be on the order of sqrt{vol_buy} since sell proceeds offset buy proceeds (not for a particular symbol, but *across the entire portfolio*).

It seems highly unlikely to me that most of the buy volume on Tues/Wed last week was from cash, and not also from sale of equities.  And, moreover, if it was from cash, then in order for the NBV to remain high, it would require a constant influx of cash into RH accounts.  Therefore I assume that the massive increase in deposit requirements actually came from the ""99%"" requirement and a massive increase in the estimated variance of the NBV on DTCC's part.

But the fucking situation is not symmetrical.  If RH did suddenly adopt a huge net long position (due to users primarily buying $GME), then the volatility to the *sell side* becomes huge, but not the volatility to the buy side.  But a huge move to the sell side is not risky to DTCC.  They want more deposits to protect the net buy side.  This isn't modeled by a normal distribution because the only way to keep having massive NBV is for users to keep depositing proportional equity (since selling other equities to buy $GME cancels out).

Of course, DTCC knows this, but it seemed like they had RH over a barrel, and if they could depress buying to limit their own exposure, that was a fortuitous consequence.

Finally, why didn't RH then adopt this position:  You could only buy $GME with equity from selling other shares.  This would make that user's contribution to the net buy volume zero.  It would also mitigate the problem of $GME causing an increase in the net buy volume.  And, moreover, it would have drastically lessened the manipulative effect on the markets, allowing people to mostly keep buying $GME."|2021-02-03 09:10:15.755295|../output/raw/2021/02/03/DueDiligence_flair_DD_091020.csv|DueDiligence|['DTCC']|[]|['I', 'WSB', 'I', 'RH', 'DTCC', 'RH', 'RH', 'NBV', 'RH', 'I', 'NBV', 'RH', 'DTCC', 'NBV', '$GME', 'DTCC', 'RH', 'RH', '$GME', '$GME', '$GME']|['RH', 'RH', 'RH', 'RH', 'RH', 'GME', 'RH', 'RH', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

I was looking at Hershey and comparing last year. They ran up from $145 at the end of January to $160 by Feb 14. 

Retail food sales have been huge all year with big YoY sales. It stands to reason that their sales for the Valentine’s Day holiday are going to crush last year. Their earnings report is Thursday. Most big box retailers placed their Valentine’s Day orders weeks if not months ago. So this should show up on their revenue.

It looks like it only updates this data bi-monthly for the 1-15 16-30th  and the next report is due out at or around the 15th.  I am going to call the SEC tomorrow and ask for intermediate data.  We need this data NOW.  If you look at this.  GME has failed to deliver a LOT of shares all the time.   When I did some highschool excel Data Analytics on it.  It is the 60th stock on the list when sorted by # of shares.

From the SEC regarding this data

>""The  figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails.

Looking at the above site.  There are links to information about Failed to deliver.[https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm)

Is GME considered a Threshold Security ✅

>In  order to be deemed a  threshold security, and thus subject to the  restrictions of Rule  203(b)(3), a security must exceed the specified  fail level for a period  of five consecutive settlement days.   Similarly, in order to be removed  from the list of threshold  securities, a security must not exceed the  specified level of fails for  a period of five consecutive settlement  days.

Does the Firm have to close out the positions? ✅

>As adopted, Rule 203(b)(3) requires any participant of a registered clearing agency (""participant"")[80](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P210_72014) to take action on all failures to deliver that exist in such securities ten days after the normal settlement date, *i.e.*, 13 consecutive settlement days.[81](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P211_72496)Specifically, the participant is required to close out the fail to   deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.  
>  
>Rule 203(b)(3) is intended to address potential abuses that may occur with large, extended fails to deliver.[89](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P221_79239)  We believe that the five-day requirement will facilitate the identification of securities with extended fails.

So  Dumb-ass me looked further back in time to the second half of  December.  It looks like GME has been failing to deliver CONSTANTLY.   This means that there are shares that Brokers HAVE to buy.  We are over the 10/13 Day limit.  What's going on here.  How can this single security CONSTANTLY fail to deliver almost every day... clearly something is going on here....  How are they CONSTANTLY failing?  Well,  that's because there are shares that are made up, it has to be.  This is shorted STILL beyond belief as of the 15th.

Our brokerages are allowed to lend out our shares as long as there are no open orders on them. So, put a daily sell limit order on all of your shares (at a reasonable 3x-4x the price that day) so that they can't be lent out. A website I also found helpful information from:

Stay strong, buy the dips, and hold, fellow retards!

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I just like the stock. I am a retard and please do your research.

&#x200B;

Edit: I am not advising anyone. I bought 15 shares at \~$290 last Wednesday, and tomorrow I'm putting my daily sell limit order at $5k lmao. And probably buying more tomorrow!

Edit 2: I’ve noticed my email shows some comments that look like they didn’t make it through due to new accounts/low karma, but I’ll try to answer the genuine questions through edits. Someone asked what platform I am using, and I use Vanguard. I’ve never had any issues with them, and they don’t limit how many $GME or $AMC shares I can buy.

Edit 3: Buying stocks with Vanguard is pretty straightforward. If you need help, feel free to PM me. Someone mentioned that the short ladders cause a placement of an artificial ceiling, meaning huge gains can’t be made. I’m not an expert by any means whatsoever, but if you look at the 2008 VW squeeze chart, that proves not to be true. Also, someone mentioned TD Ameritrade is limiting the sell limit. Go as high as it will let you, and if you don’t feel comfortable with that, it’s okay. If worse comes to worst, get a Vanguard account, buy shares through them, and set your sell limits to the stars.

Edit 4: Do not buy your shares on margin! A few of you have let me know that shares bought with cash accounts cannot be used for short attacks. Not sure if you all can see their comment, but /u/Germanicusss has advised to “pay down your margin debt and/or instruct your broker to move the shred into your cash account”. I need to do more research into that. Another reminder that this is not financial advise and I’m not an expert. For those of you telling me (with malicious intent) that I’m a retard, tell me something I don’t know."|2021-02-03 09:10:15.755295|../output/raw/2021/02/03/DueDiligence_flair_DD_091019.csv|DueDiligence|['$GME']|['GME']|['I', '$GME', 'A', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', '$GME', '$AMC', 'I', 'PM', 'VW', 'TD', 'A', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'AMC']

I am not a tax advisor, but I did some research and wanted to make you guys aware of these things before the next tax season comes around and your jaws drop because Uncle Sammy wants a cut of your tendies.

**LET'S START WITH CAPITAL LOSSES:**

I know a handful of you do not care if you end up holding the bag. But also consider this: you can use these losses to **REDUCE YOUR TAX BILL**. You can only do this if you do not have any capital gains or your capital losses is greater than your capital gains for the year (you have more losses than gains). Unfortunately you can **only deduct up to $3,000 per year** ($1,500 if married filing separately), so please don't risk more than you can afford. If you do happen to lose more than $3,000, I suggest only selling some shares at a time each year (probably around December) up to a loss of $3,000. The deduction used to be $4,000 so it can change year to year. **(Please see edit below for losses >$3,000).**

**CAPITAL GAINS (WHEN YOU COLLECT YOUR TENDIES):**

There are two different capital gains you can realize after you sell your shares: short term (<=1 year) and long term (>1 year).

Short term gains are taxed as ordinary income. What does that mean? It's essentially added together with your salary.

**Marginal Rates:** For tax year 2021, the top tax rate remains 37% for individual single taxpayers with incomes greater than $523,600 ($628,300 for married couples filing jointly). The other rates are:

* 35%, for incomes over $209,425 ($418,850 for married couples filing jointly);
* 32% for incomes over $164,925 ($329,850 for married couples filing jointly);
* 24% for incomes over $86,375 ($172,750 for married couples filing jointly);
* 22% for incomes over $40,525 ($81,050 for married couples filing jointly);
* 12% for incomes over $9,950 ($19,900 for married couples filing jointly).
* The lowest rate is 10% for incomes of single individuals with incomes of $9,950 or less ($19,900 for married couples filing jointly).

These are just general information. Please consult with a tax advisor as everyone's financial situations are different.

Also: there's a handful of you making donations which is freaking awesome. You should save those receipts as those donations can also be used to deduct your taxes. I currently cannot find info that would make sense (I guess I'm just as retarded as everyone else here). *(Edit: This only applies if you do an itemized deduction. Too lazy and complicated for me unless you have a smart tax advisor)*

If you got anything else I should add or inaccuracies in these info, I'll be sure to edit them. If this doesn't get approved as a post, then I just wasted the last few hours researching and typing this up.

There’s a ton of language in there about “strengthening essential data systems”. There is also an acknowledgment that such task may “require new technology”.

Some relevant language from strategy:

“Directs relevant federal agencies to collect, produce, share, analyze, and collaborate with respect to data supportive of COVID-19 response and recovery efforts.”

“Assist localities that struggle with public health infrastructure challenges that limit effective reporting or managing of COVID-19 data. The federal government will focus on states and localities that continue to struggle with antiquated data systems, especially jurisdictions that have trouble connecting testing laboratories and public health agencies to support case investigation, contact tracing, and support services for isolation of potentially exposed individuals. The federal government will work to surge personnel to assist with manual processes
in the near-term and develop data technologies to automate in the long-term.”

Where is all this new technology coming from? 🤷🏽‍♂️

In comes CLOV:

THE CLOVER ASSISTANT 

You have the exclusive opportunity to use Clover’s technology, the Clover Assistant. The Clover Assistant is designed by doctors for doctors to help enhance patient care and reduce administrative burden. We take advantage of Clover Health’s expansive data platform to deliver actionable and clear information, taking into consideration unique, patient-specific clinical data, needs, and circumstances. With a personalized design that focuses on proactive care, the Clover Assistant synthesizes and analyzes each patient’s information and makes real-time, personalized, dynamic, evidence-based recommendations right at the point of care.


ALSO read around and found that there have been a few bills introduced in congress over the past few months around data and privacy related to health. 

What do I think?

1. Biden = healthcare and he’s looking to score big there. This will be a focal point. You know ThE fIrSt 1o0 dAyS

2. The language in Elizabeth Warren’s bill is super specific about protections on how patient data is stored, anonymized, and shared. Okay... 

3. Pharmacy’s partner up with fed for covid vaccination and the day before clover issued a statement around getting covid vaccines. 


4. Now all of that sounds great. However, why the sudden rush to introduce bills that are clearly addressing a concern around patient’s health data? It raises all sorts if questions for me like:

Who’s collecting this data that you’re so worried about its use and privacy?

Where are these concerns coming from? What is it that we are protecting ourselves from? Is that not weird y’all? Anyway, I guess the point there is that there is clearly some big push to collect and use our patient data by the government (pretty scary imo). Plus you know, google backed Clover. Which leads me to believe, based on the language around new technology in Biden’s initiative, that they are going to have to acquire this technology from somewhere. Where from though? 


Anyway, I’m excited to see how this narrative plays out in the coming weeks and months. Healthcare is a heavy political space, especially under Biden. Based on recent news, something is brewing. Too many coincidences lining up.

The shorts and WSB (with some whales and institutional supports) are fighting neck and neck, but why? 

The shorts want to bankrupt GME, we know that won’t happen because this company has Ryan Cohen as ceo. 

The shorts want to bring the price down as low as they can, but we keep buying the dips. If I’m honest, THE SHORTS ARE WINNING RIGHT NOW, but the short interest is still high, so they have to cover. 

#WE ARE SPENDING OUR CAPITAL BUYING THE DIPS, WHEN WE SHOULD HOLD OUR SHARES NOW, LET THE PRICE TANK, THEN BUY UP EVEN MORE SHARES 

Would you rather buy 3 shares for 80 a piece, just for the shorts to attack again tomorrow and the next day, day after day, or do you want to “let them” win, let the price tank, then buy up even more shares before they can cover? 

Spending 240 on 3 shares, or spending 240 on 24 shares at 10$ a piece WHILE eating up the available shares? I know which one sounds better to me. 






#THE SHORTS PLAN 


There’s a very plausible theory that the shorts want to bring the price down very cheaply, then they will buy far OTM calls, and trigger the squeeze themselves. Then once at the top they’ll buy puts and tank the price again. 


This allows them to 

#Cover 

#Make money on the upswing 

#Make money on the downswing 

#Possibly erase all of their losses and retain their investor base 



#TLDR: let the shorts drive the price down, DONT BUY THE DIP, just hold your shares you have now. And with your remaining capital watch the price tank, then snatch up 10x the amount of shares you would be able to during a normal dip.

Both are quite right. Vascepa is icosapent ethyl... a purified and modified omega-3 that when taken on top of a statin (think Lipitor) basically cuts your risk of dying, having a heart attack, or a stroke by 25%. 
Sounds good right? Lipitor was the best selling drug of all time until Humira. Yet it started out slow in its first year just like Vascepa...and without a pandemic. Now we have generic statins with hundreds of millions of patients worldwide taking daily. Lipitor had its run though. Just ask Pfizer. And it still sells tons of cabbage. But there is only one Vascepa that reduces your triglycerides and reduces your cardiovascular risk. Funny thing is...it’s not the triglyceride reduction that bestows the benefit......more later......Less stokes, stents, open heart bypass surgery....and DEATH!!! 

There are many different oils, or properly called fatty acids, in those over the counter omega-3’s you may take. But only this particular one has been shown in double blind randomized trials to Work. At least two of the others, DHA and DPA likely actually hurt!!!!! No one really knows why. We think it’s it’s powerful anti-inflammatory properties of 100% icosapent ethyl or EPA (Vascepa). 
Think.....“it coats the insides of your arteries and puts out the fire connected to the ticking time bomb”. For reference see the New England Journal of Medicine article from 2018 called the REDUCIT study. Also see the EVAPORATE study from 2020 that showed coronary artery plaque regression. That’s right...Vascepa likely is liquid draino for your coronaries!!!! 

Let that sink in a minute. There are two large Covid-19 studies reporting in first half of this year called MITIGATe and PREPARE—IT. Prepare-It will likely read out end of Feb. Mitigate interim around May. The thought is the anti inflammatory power of V helps. One Canadian study presented in December at the national lipid association showed statistics better than Remdesivir. Vascepa may snuff out the cytokines storm that kills you from Covid!!!! 
It may also disrupt the viruses transmissibility as covid is wrapped in...you guessed it...fatty acids and lipids. 
Let that sink in a minute. 

Amarin won the FDA approval for CVT reduction in Dec 2019. She hit $26 soon after. March 30, 2020 a Nevada judge was hoodwinked into overturning the patents of the original label for treating only patients with triglycerides over 500 to treat pancreatitis, thus potentially allowing generics to entreat themselves to AMARIN’s three billion a year US market (when mature..we only a year in). More than 90% of Vascepa scripts are for the cardiovascular indication...not for the skinny label treatment of triglycerides...for pancreatitis. The money is in the CVT risk reduction...i.e...the statin patients world wide. AMARIN spent nearly a billion dollars bringing this indication to market. And now generics want to try and steal it all. So far so good except for the market perception. AMARIN claims to have the API sources secured. 

Thus far there is one generic made by HICKMA. The company that won the court case. Litigation is still ongoing and AMARIN is now suing them for infringing on the CVT indication patents that are still quite valid. Damages could be huge!!!! 

Amarin won EU recommendation for the CVT indication in Europe on Friday and can start marketing likely by April. Europe’s market is maybe 50% larger than the US. Thus far Amarin has maintained the US market with Hickma currently holding 6% of the market. Yet the stock cratered from $26 to $4 in March. Today she sits just over $8. The drop was likely because all thought the US market was completely toast. Clearly it is not 4 months post generic launch. Add to this that Lovaza still makes up a large part of the prescription omega-3 market and there really is no good reason to ever take Lovaza now that Vascepa is here, and you can see that AMRN’s revenues are going to be huge. Last year was unaudited $611 mill. 1 billion tax loss carry over. 550 million in cash or investments. No debt. Zero debt...... Price currently $8.25 

There seems to be a lot of selling between entities to ladder step her down almost daily since the March debacle. Despite that she has doubled. That the company updated its “Change of control” package and policy in an 8-k filed this Friday, one day after European approval recommendation could mean a Buy Out is imminent. Amarin was built for a buy out. She a one drug pony, but the drug is a doozy. I truly believe US can generate $1 bill in sales. EU $3 billion a year. Approval in China by Amarin partner could generate $5 bill a year but AMARIN gets a straight high teens royalty from Eddingpharm ( the Chinese owned partner) 

Long story short, this drug saves lives and WILL make a lot of money. Last I looked there were 22 mill shares short. With float of 386 million but much more than half the float is locked up. The daily shenanigans need to stop. The respect and eyes of the world needs to be on Vascepa!!!! It’s truly a lifesaver with untold uses and benefits. I honestly believe there is a huge covid benefit to being on Vascepa and we will soon know. Let’s see what happens when the PEOPLE get behind a company that has been screwed over and over yet gets back up again because the science of the drug is a once in 50 years proven scientific discovery. I bet she deservedly goes gangbusters and MOST IMPORTANTLY ....then HOLDS her gains. There won’t be a find a chair when the music stops here. 
Your consideration is appreciated."|2021-02-03 09:10:15.755295|../output/raw/2021/02/03/DueDiligence_flair_DD_091020.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['DEATH', 'DHA', 'DPA', 'EPA', 'DUCIT', 'ORATE', 'IT', 'V', 'FDA', 'CVT', 'US', 'CVT', 'MARIN', 'MARIN', 'API', 'ICKMA', 'MARIN', 'CVT', 'EU', 'CVT', 'US', 'US', 'US', 'I', 'US', 'EU', 'MARIN', 'WILL', 'I', 'I', 'EOPLE', 'I', 'MOST', 'ANTLY', 'HOLDS']|['CVT', 'CVT', 'CVT', 'CVT']

u/PlatNoFeatures has done some great DD on the stock and that got me looking into it.

I am retarded. I did really good on the whole AMC and GME craze, got cocky, and fucked up everything on horrible calls with no research. Well I won’t do that again. Now I’ll fuck up money while doing lots of research so I have no excuse and feel even shittier.

I won’t go into the DD Plat already did, check this for that: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwo5p5/callaway/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwo5p5/callaway/)

Any way, as you can see from this fucking crayon drawing, now is a good time to buy ELY. The blue curvy line is not just a representation of my floppy dick, but also the 21 adaptive EMA moving average. Stonks love moving average and it’s about touching now so buy it might be gud idea. It might dip a little below I guess, the average is not a fucking time machine or a crystal ball.

Since December there has been support at around 22-23 dollars, and the resistance is obviously at 30 right now. High end price target is $40 with earnings coming up.

Now im new and obviously retarded so like...my crayon drawing probably doesnt mean shit but stonks supposedly love the average and we aren’t way above or below right now. I am highly considering selling everything i’m bag holding, which will come out to between 700-800 if I sold everything tomorrow no matter what lol and going in on calls.

That’s obviously not a big move for shares and I want to build the base up so calls it will most likely be. I have one 2/19 $31c right now at $1.39 premium. Probably go for 30’s if I “yolo” on this. I know it’s small money for now, fuck you im paying tuition.

One thing that is concerning is volume is low, but if wsb autists get on board, maybe we can do something.

Looking at RSI on the bottom and comparing to price vs average in the next pic, we see that it doesn’t appear to be overbought right now, further indication to try and get in around or slightly lower than today’s close

This is obviously not financial advice. Someone convince me to fuck off at 50% loss of initial investment on GME and AMC (including 2/19 calls for AMC) and go all in on this instead….you fuckers would love to see me blow up the account anyway.

This was NIO’s 6th consecutive month of sales growth, and they’ve now delivered 82,866 vehicles. They continue to outperform Xpeng and Li Auto, BUT are still trailing behind Papa Elon. So who gives a shit? *YOU should.* 💦😩

NIO is *only up 5%* over the past month, lagging and consolidating behind the broader market. Despite the fantastic delivery numbers AND the corresponding increase in EV market share, the share price DROPPED 2% today. Reminder that Pooh Bear J-Ping wants **25% of all new cars sold in the country to be electric by 2025**. NIO’s continual market share growth into *the* largest EV market in the world is literally an unmatched opportunity, with China’s EV sales [expected to top 1.8 MILLION THIS YEAR](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upcoming-catalyst-could-move-chinese-213553234.html). It has almost completely retraced it’s price back to it’s pre-NIO Day levels, suggesting that it’s ready for a breakout. No, literally [go look at it’s chart right now.](https://imgur.com/a/dtPsHVb)

&#x200B;

In addition to deliveries, NIO is rumored to be looking to **expand into Europe** with it’s SUVs. *THIS MAY BE THE LAST ENTRY POINT BEFORE THE RUN-UP AFTER EUROPE EXPANSION PLANS* They’ve also recently released their first sedan model and are expanding their Battery as a Service infrastructure throughout China. It also goes without saying that having active backup from your authoritarian country is VERY helpful.

So before the downvotes just rub those two brain cells of yours together for a minute to focus on this for the next three minutes. (Fuck you I know what I said)

Due to all of the paper handed bitches, hedge funds shorting, and just general fuckery at the hands of retail trading apps, particularly robinhood, NOK is currently on MASSIVE discount.  Why do I say that? Because the fine folks over at DNB markets, Norway’s leading investment bank, have raised its stock valuation to €4.80, or for those of us who speak freedom, $5.80.

Why does that matter? I hear you starting to ask. Well it matters because it’s currently trading at only $4.53. 

There is over a dollar of pure value just waiting to be claimed. Not to mention it is expecting a very strong earnings report that can cause that value to go up even more. O and the company had been vocal about wanting to start its dividend payments back up. This earnings report should put them on the map for a lot of people. I’m buying more tomorrow, see y’all in space.
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

TLDR: worst case I make $1 per share as it goes up back to its evaluated price, or I💎🤲 until it hits $10 a share as it’s 5G grows in the coming years. 

I’m not giving investment advice and no one should take this as such. Just did some research and wanted to share.

Collusion between RH, prime brokers and the DTC can potentially damper the effects of the short squeeze because of loose and unsanctioned SEC rules regarding Regulation SHO that governs short selling, and in this case, [failures-to-deliver](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm).

If you have a margin account, brokerages do not need your permission to lend your exercisable shares if you buy a call or sell a put. This is their way of temporarily creating shares out of thin air, aka counterfit shares. While you wait for expiration date, brokerages keep a tab of all its customers' ""lendable shares"" and sends it to the DTC in this thing called the share borrowing program. The DTC will then lend those to other brokerages whos customers just bought a call option that is essentially a naked call initiated by the seller. Now while this call option remains open, since it's a naked short, the shares get to be lent again into another new naked short in a other brokerage, in **an ever-perpetuating cycle that results in a temporary increase of the number of total shares traded**.

This trick hedge fund use is called Continuous Net Settlement (CNS), and there are many other ways for shortsellers can manipulate the stock price, inclusing Ex-clearing and Fails-to-deliver strategies.

So if you buy a call or sell a put from a margin account, you're essentially allowing the number of total shares to grow artificially which makes the price go down!!!

Plus, these created shares cannot be accounted for, but in most cases, undiscoled short shares typically represent 20 to 50 times the number of failures-to-deliver (which is the only metric the SEC tracks).... that's HUGE!

Now to the main subject GME is still an undervalued treasure. I know it seems like it might be overvalued because of the euphoria around GME these past two weeks, and how the media (and even some folks on wsb) try to portray it as a bubble, which it isn't.

1. Its a company with around $6 billions in annual revenues, and a new set of innovative leaders (Cohen and friends) who have a track record of turning companies into money printers (Chewy Inc now worth over $44 billion, was first losing money and bringing less than $26 million in revenue).
2. Its growing its E-commerce side by a whooping 254% (25% of all revenue was form online sales last quarter).

The hype is dying as all hypes do, the whole thing is glued with spit and running on pure randomness and doom inevitability (""we're all poor so we don't care, it's either moon or bankruptcy"").

TH THA THA TH, time out.

Listen up fucktards, I'm poor too, but that's not the point. We need to go over the whole situation with perspective, and this is not some detailed nerd shit so it'll go easy on your 2 braincells.  


Repeat after me: we are not gonna trigger the short squeeze. WE ARE NOT GONNA TRIGGER THE SHORTSQUEEZE.  
It's easy to fall into disbelief by misunderstanding our part in all of this. We are not triggering shit, so all the retards YELLING buy buy buy every time it starts to go up need to come back to reality. It's NOT our job to trigger the short squeeze nor would we be able to.  


Picture a roman colosseum (an old stadium you mongs). In the middle of the arena, down in the pit you have all the shorters doing their thing, having a jolly good time. There's several tunnels surrounding the pit and leading OUT to freedom. 

To get the short squeeze we need them right there in the pit, so that's done. They're already there, shorting GME to shit, not by 13% which was enough to rocket VW share price 5X back in 2008, but by a staggering 50% to 130% (numbers irrelevant, point is the ammo is more than enough). As you can see there's plenty of shorters in the pit, so they're confident and comfortable.

  
Now, for the shortsqueeze to work you need 2 things:

\- a boogeyman  
\- something blocking the goddamn exit  


The boogeyman is ANYTHING that makes them fear for their billions and run for the exit trampling each other on the way out. The less shares available for them to cover their shorts the smaller this boogeyman can be, because they will panic knowing they may not be able to cover at all, meaning THE END.   
It could be literally a thousand different things, and the longer we go into the future the more likely that something will HIT. Could be someone scooping up an extra slice of the company (Ryan Cohen for example), earnings blowing out, anything. And this company has received SO MUCH free advertising in the last few weeks it's not unreasonable to think that they are at a historic turning point (not gonna get into the reasons why it's already a great value investment), and it will soon show.  


THEN, we come.  
We, the group of INDIVIDUALS that happen to be investing in the same stock because we like it.

What are we? We are bodies.  
Pilling up.  
On the fucking exits.

The more shares you own the fatter you are, and the fatter you are the more space you take up on the exit. And my friend my friend, the hedgies are REALLY gonna need the exit when the boogeyman shows up.  


Our role here is to buy as many shares as we can in order to clog the exit doors, so that the shorters have no way out when a boogeyman comes.If something big drops and there's not enough unflinching share ownership (buyers that won't sell no matter what), then the shorts will just make their way out and fuck all will happen.

Sure, there must be a lot of individuals and institutions unwilling to sell to bail shorts if they need to cover, say most of the GME board for example and maybe a couple institutions, but likely not nearly enough.

That's our part. If say half the people on WSB buy an average of 5 shares, that would be nearly 20 million shares. That's nearly 1/3 of the total GME shares available.If say, over a month we are able to turn that average into 10 per person, half of WSB would own a staggering 60% of all the shares, and you may say oh well that's not possible BUT JUST THINK ABOUT IT, many among us have investments in the hundreds of thousands, some even millions. Each one of those can bring the average up a hell of a lot.Heck, even I with my 20 shares god bless them, can make up for 3 people on WSB that bought nothing.  


Time really is on our side, if we just keep gobbling up shares we can really block those exits for the shorts, and when the time comes they will panic because they will realise there simply aren't enough shares to cover - GME goes straight to the MOON.

We don't need to worry at all, there is no losing here because mathematically it's a time bomb.THIS WILL NOT SURVIVE ON HYPE.HYPE IS NOT OUR FRIEND.Understanding the situation and calmly and patiently executing is how we can succeed.  


We need to unify, clarify, focus and execute.  


&#x200B;

**TLDR -**

**The GME gang is losing its way because its all hype now. Hype will kill this because hype dies.We need to clarify our role and execute with patience. We don't trigger short squeezes, our function is to accumulate as many shares as possible so that when the time comes and something big and positive drops, the shorters try to cover but can't because we have all the stock (or most of it), they panic and GME moons.Basically the only thing that matters is to keep accumulating as many shares as you can, and to understand your role. This diamond hand shit is NOT needed because the price is irrelevant, it's the inevitable math of the short squeeze that matters and that's where the focus needs to be.**

Over the past week you've been bombarded with numerous challenges, from brokers restricting purchases, fake news, to stock dilution. It is always harder to hold a winning position than a losing one so my hats off to you sir if you are still holding.

With that being said, I'd like to talk to you about a next potential candidate for our short squeeze strategy. The company is Tilray ($TLRY). You've probably seen this symbol floating around in different posts but I'd like to talk to you specifically about the numbers and the timing of it.

If you've been living under a rock or on a tree (You ape) Tilray is a Canadian Cannabis company with its stock traded on the Nasdaq (Not a lot of legal Cannabis companies are traded on the regulated exchanges so this is a big thing). Aphria ($APHA) is in the process of acquiring Tilray and post-acquisition will become the largest Cannabis company in the world. The deal is expected to close sometime during the second quarter and $APHA will be taking over the Tilray name and the $TLRY symbol on the Nasdaq.

As per Yahoo Finance, the latest float is about 95 Million shares and even though the current shares sold short (From Jan 15, 2021) is 34.37 Million which is moderate, one should pay attention to the historical total shares sold short which from a month ago has grown more than 24%. This means there is something in play and I am also willing to bet based on current price action and historical trends, the next short interest release will go up as well.

&#x200B;

[Large Rise in Total Shares Sold Short](https://preview.redd.it/pemqywhf07f61.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=813869b0195bc158c342de184f9a9dae2d3d598f)

Based on the amount of money involved there is probably one large or multiple large hedge funds playing this since they are the only ones sophisticated enough to sell shares short especially involving that much money. You can also look at the price action itself prior to Monday (When Good news got released) during different times of the day, there are always trades put in near the closing to make sure the prices don't exceed a certain price level which indicates true active manipulation by the bears. Retail traders are not sophisticated enough to do this thus indicating large hedge fund involvement.

There are a couple of factors that will help us with this conquest.

1. The Timing and News: Obviously, with this democratically controlled congress, legalization is a priority and has the highest chances of succeeding in this current political environment. As you have seen before (Do your own DD), any indication or news of progress of legalization has pushed this stock up. As of Monday, three senators; Chuck Schumer (NY), Cory Brooker (NJ), and Ron Wyden (OR) just promised to introduce marijuana legalization reform in the ""early part"" of the year. So there is a string of news and progress coming.
2. Way better fundamentals than $GME and $AMC: The poor fundamentals obviously bothered a lot of people who wanted to buy $GME and $AMC. But in comparison, if you dig into Tilray's financials, it is significantly better. Especially the cash balance. Mostly importantly, Tilray's product lines are diversified and they are currently still growing (this is a big thing for any business), especially in the international markets.
3. Its already primed: If you dig around Reddit, WSB, or even Stocktwits, you can see numerous people have already committed to baggage holding this stock. You are not too early and you won't be the only one to do so.
4. Harder for Management to Dilute the shares: As we saw previously, one of the challenges for the buyers of $GME and $AMC was battling against management's decision of stock dilution by the companies themselves. To put it in retard terms, diluting a stock is essentially printing more shares thus creating inflation in the stock so its harder to go up. Since Tilray is in the process of the acquisition by Aphria and it is an ALL STOCK deal via conversion ratio, it makes it harder for Tilray to implement dilution without significantly risking the deal.
5. Lightning can strike twice: A short-squeeze already happened in the past (2018) so you know the short-squeeze strategy already worked for this stock so it can work again. The brokers and exchanges are more prepared as their volatility risk models are already prepared to support significant high levels of volatility for this stock. Less chance for disruptions.
6. A means to an end: Lets be realistic, if you are holding $GME and $AMC right now, you will sell it. It could be tomorrow or it could be 3 years from now (If those companies are still in business) but you WILL sell it.  THAT is a very long time to hold baggage just to prove a point and you know the businesses you are holding suck from a business standpoint. Now since the Tilray and Aphia acquisition deal is on a timetable which will be completed sometime in the second quarter, that can be your exit time. You can go out gracefully if you choose to as you've already proven your point, made some money, and on the dawn of Tilray becoming a different company and under new management. For those of you choosing to keep those those shares post acquisition, how would you feel about holding shares to the largest Cannabis company in the world with good fundamentals, and on the dawn of full federal marijuana legalization? I would love it.
7. Great Symbolism: Lets face it, investing in a failing gaming company and movie theaters during a global pandemic doesn't really scream smart symbolic reform or via la revolution that well. But if you choose to focus on making a stand with a legal Cannabis company with a great future you can at the same time promote marijuana legalization and stick it to the hedge funds and dark capitalism at the same time. What better way to make a point to promote a great cause, symbiotic change, and at the same time make some money (If we are all on board).

Ok that's it! Kudos to you for making it to the end. Apologies for the long post but I really wanted to  get my points through. You all should obviously do your own due diligence and if you see what I see and the immense opportunity that is in front of us, and agree with my thoughts then lets do this!

BTW, if you are really retarded; I am NOT telling you to sell your $GME and $AMC. I'm only suggesting that we should start to look at other potential candidates for our short squeeze strategy to continue our cause of burning hedge funds and dark capitalism.

I just feel Tilray is such a great candidate for our cause and strategy especially with so much marijuana reform coming our way. We can make a greater point for a greater cause.

Thank you and trade well,

Here’s a little of my own DD.

There is So much to talk about. But, the First Data deal made Fiserv a powerhouse in payment processing and digital payments when they took over Clover. This market has three main pillars:
Point of sales (POS) terminals
Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments
E-commerce solutions
  Being a leader in any one of these categories should make Fiserv a $100 billion company. Its current value is $70 billion. But Fiserv is now the largest POS provider and P2P payment processor... And the company is going to use its expansive network to quickly build out its new omnichannel e-commerce solution.
A leader in all three of these categories has the potential to be well over a $300 billion company. FISV is partnered with Zelle, does more payments than PYPL’s Venmo and SQ  CashApp. PYPL has a market cap of 278 billion as of last Friday. If FISV can get to $100 billion it should put its PT at $150 and that’s very low ball. Their margins are going to continue to grow and if they just matched PYPL market cap, it would put them over $300 a share. There are several potential catalysts as far as buy backs, earnings, etc. 

As I mentioned above, Clover is bigger than Square, yet is only part of FISV business, and the two go after different markets. Clover (generally) works with bigger businesses. Over 90% of Clover customers process over $125,000 in payments annually. Only 65% of Square’s customers transact that much. Not trying to bash SQ, only showing that FISV has a lot of catching up to do as it is still trailing SQ market cap by 30 Billion. 

The difference between Zelle and PYPL’s Venmo and SQ (cash app) is that Zelle is backed by multiple large institutions like Chase, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, and Capital One. The traditional financial institutions basically joined together to build a network so they wouldn’t be outdone by the likes of Venmo or Cash App. The advantage is that all of the financial institutions involved
in Zelle are marketing the P2P service to their customers and it’s only going to grow. Fintech will be one of the hottest sectors going forward and FISV will be the leader. No reason why FISV isn’t at least $150-200 by EOY. Earnings 2/9. Don’t miss this undervalued STRONG company."|2021-02-03 09:10:15.755295|../output/raw/2021/02/03/DueDiligence_flair_DD_091020.csv|DueDiligence|['FISV', 'WILL', 'OUBLE', 'EFORE']|['FISV']|['DD', 'POS', 'P', 'A', 'FISV', 'SQ', 'PYPL', 'FISV', 'PT', 'PYPL', 'I', 'FISV', 'SQ', 'FISV', 'SQ', 'SQ', 'U', 'S', 'P', 'FISV', 'FISV', 'EOY', 'TRONG']|['FISV', 'FISV', 'FISV', 'FISV', 'FISV', 'FISV']

Last few days there has been this talk about shorts already covered, and S3 Partner's data showed a large decline in short interest. However, is this the full picture? We will be looking at this using Math. 

Context :[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)

 """"it reduces the traditional SI % Float, Instead of Shares Shorted/Float our calc is Shares Shorted/ (Float + Shares Shorted) """"

Basically, the S3 short interest is calculated as

f(x) = x/(k+x)

where f(x) is S3's short interest, x is shares shorted, and k is float, which we can assume is a constant

For the Math savvy autists, you probably already see the problem. If you are not, open Desmos and graph the above function.

For k been positive and real, This function **asymptotically approaches 1** i.e. 100%. It should be pretty obvious - shares shorted + something positive is larger than shares shorted, so the fraction is smaller than 1. And, surprise surprise, data before 1/29 have short interest higher than 1!

**That means that either S3 partners is completely bullshiting their data, or the more likely case -  short interest displayed before 1/29 is traditional interest.**

Looking at this tweet [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897), we can see that the traditional SI on 2/1 is **78.16MM** shares on **51.03MM** float, which equates to....drum roll please...

***153%*** ***Short interest!***

So not only have the shorts not squeezed, they have doubled down. And this explains the price action much better - the price dipped down on a **Increased selling**.

&#x200B;

Found this in a comment buried in a comment on a post ([Sober view post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbaktb/sober_review_time_what_are_the_actual_data_we_can/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)) and thought I would shine some light on it. The sober view post has some very good DD presenting both potential upside and downsides in what I believe is a fair manner. Be cautious, there are a lot of downsides. I recommend you read it before you simply get hyped. That being said... Hype Train inbound 🚂🚂🚂

 [S3 partners intentionally changed how they calculate SI % interest to manipulate public perception of shorts closing their positions.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/) 

Pretty much the reason why S3 partners is estimating 55% short interest is because they changed the formula. It would be equivalent to what we would call 122% SI before the change (other people's math, not my own).

&#x200B;

They changed the formula from 

`SI = (shorts/float)`
to
`SI = (shorts/(float+shorts))`

This formula guarantees SI to always be beneath 100. 

Pretty much, 

0% is still 0%

50% is the new 100%

It doesn't scale up exactly linearly.

Do your DD, this is not financial advice, just thought I would bring this to light.

Be careful, do your research, not only is the game changing in front of us, but so are the standard measures.

Edit 2:

Cleaned up some formatting for mobile, added link to sobering post

Note:

I am not claiming the short squeeze is still happening or that it is likely happening. I would guess it's very likely they bought high strike puts which would make the amount we would have to go up SIGNIFICANTLY higher.

Assess your own risk, read the sobering post linked above, and seriously consider the risk you're willing to assume

**- A short that doesn't have to follow the uptick rule, can be sold whenevs.**

# WHO THE FUCK SETS WHICH ARE SHORT EXEMPT?

# THE BROKERS, and it's not even checked unless an audit occurs

""...broker-dealers  are required to document their polices for how they mark orders as  exempt, and, if audited, provide evidence that they have followed their  documented policies and procedures. Broker-dealers therefore mark an order short exempt if they believe it  qualifies for an exception. The primary exception is the use of  non-standard pricing quotes for trade execution. **That means that if  prices come in outside the** [**National Best Bid or Offer (NBBO)**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp)**,  they can initiate a short-sale order that they judge would have  qualified as an uptick in more orderly markets.** Marking for these orders  is signified by SSE.

TLDR; Broker-Dealers are marking a HUGE AMOUNT of shorts as exempt from the uptick rule because all of our smoothbrained sell limits of $69420,69 are outside the National Best Bid, according to them, but it's ok because they are self-regulating.... **FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUU.....**

Tanger literally has open air malls that make it really unique in this new era of bricks and mortar retail.

Now, let’s look at the technicals. It currently has a 52% short float, which lags large squeezes like GME (121%) and SPCE (72%), but exceeds that of other performing names like AMC and BB.

I think $SKT is so compelling at a roughly $1.2B market cap. For comparison, its primary competitor $MAC has double the valuation, but does not have the same flexible retail space as Tanger.

If you look at GME’s short squeeze, they shot up right around $20 or ($1.2B market cap)!! 👀 Furthermore, Melvin and other big hedge funds are long on their $SKT shorts, and any surprise to the upside will send the stock absolutely flying.

Tanger has also reinstated their dividend. In a time where many bricks and mortar retail shops are desparate for cash, $SKT is out here with $700M of liquidity.

Companies with this much cash relative to their market cap are INTRINSICALLY UNDERVALUED. Even if this thing were to just double in market cap to just under $3B, that would leave a share price of roughly $32. The intrinsic value of the mall network is worth AT LEAST (in my mind) 5-7X where we are now at roughly $13 ($1.2B). 

These other names that I mentioned above have taken off given their market cap of $3-5B, and I FULLY EXPECT THAT RALLY TO CONTINUE. The short interest here is just too overwhelming for it to not push the stock flying at the slightest uptick.

But for the best value play, FACTORED WITH THE HEAVY SHORT FLOAT, I gotta go with $SKT. Holding 3200 shares at $17 and adding more as we go down. 18.7 days left for shorters to cover, so I think the squeeze is coming soon.

** Check out Tanger’s new CEO, Steven Yalof, if you are interested. He was a prominent leader at Simon Property Group, with the intent on expanding consumer base beyond retail stores. Let’s hope he get’s it right with $SKT. 🙏🏾

FEB 15 PT: $55

P.S. Do your patriotic duty and save the malls

I know GME is still the hottest thing around. But, I am here to present a smart play, short and long term.

Desktop Metal (DM) DD

DM is a pure play manufacturing company that develops metal 3d printers. They are looking to replace metal casting and metal injection molding in the next 5 - 10 years. I believe that it could become a major player in the advanced manufacturing revolution and have 10x valuation.

The share price right now is around $25. I am expecting it to go to at least $30 in the very near future and this can easily go to $100 in 2-3 years.

Pros :

1. Stellar team: The team consist of professors from MIT, engineers from google,  Stratasys and the likes.

2. Clients: All major automotive OEMs such as General Motors, Ford, Nissan as well as Electronics manufacturers such as SBD are their client.

3. They just launched a new manufacturing system today. The new printer eliminated the solvent debind process which will decrease the cost and time of manufacturing.

4. Earnings are coming up on 11th Feb.

5. The average price target is around $26. The high is $30. The buy rating is around 70% with 0% sell rating.

6. It has a 25% short interest. There are around 15000 $25 calls expiring on 19th Feb. The short sellers are trying to keep the price of the stock below $25. Notice that today the price jumped on the news of the new printer but fell immediately afterwards.

7. Chamath did a PIPE investment in this.

8. It's 10th on the PRNT etf by Cathie Woods.

9. They just bought a dental 3d printing company which is a leader in their field. They have enough cash reserve to buy competitors and increase their revenue streams.

Cons :

1. The company is still pre revenue. Earliest revenue would be by 2022 probably.

2. Huge competition from players such as 3ds, Stratasys, Formlabs etc

(More cons are welcome)

My positions:

100 shares at $21.35

7 calls for $40 05/21,
9 calls for $35 05/21,
1 call for $20 05/21

Due to all the positive sentiment around, this should easily run upto atleast $30 before the earnings. It has already touched $28 last week. Also, for the Technical analysis geeks, this has formed a nice cup and handle shape and should be ready to rocket!

Buying May or further call should make 75-100% profit in the short term. Should hold shares for the long term.

PS: This is not an investment advice. I am a Mechanical Engineer and I love 3d printing and hence I have invested in this stock. Please do your personal DD.

SweetWater Brewing Company is a craft brewery founded in 1997 by Freddy Bensch and Kevin McNerney in Atlanta, Georgia. SweetWater's beers are unpasteurized and distribution is limited to select states

SweetWater recently annouced that their beer will [be available in 27 states with Western Expansion](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210121005247/en/SweetWater-Brewing-Company-Reaches-New-Heights-Launching-Statewide-in-Colorado-February-1)

>SweetWater’s expansion into the first U.S. state to legalize recreational marijuana comes shortly after its [November 2020 acquisition](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-inc-announces-strategic-entry-into-the-united-states-with-an-agreement-to-acquire-sweetwater-brewing-company-301166616.html) by Aphria Inc

Irwin simon, the CEO of Aphria, has a track record for aggressive expansion. He brings a unique background who specializes in M&As. Aphria’s recent acquisition of SweetWater was a strategic play to expand into US & more importantly, creating brand awareness. 

>We will establish and grow our U.S. presence through SweetWater's robust, profitable platform of craft brewing innovation, manufacturing, marketing and distribution expertise. At the same time, we will build brand awareness for our adult-use cannabis brands, Broken Coast, Good Supply, Riff and Solei, through our participation in the growing $29 billion craft brew market in the U.S. ahead of potential future state or federal cannabis legalization

**US Trademarks**

Aphria proactively filed US Trademarks for a number of their brands:

[Broken Coast](https://uspto.report/TM/90383411)

[Riff](https://uspto.report/TM/90383302)  

[Solei](https://uspto.report/TM/90383374)

Irwin is leveraging SweetWater's existing infrastructure to accelerate Aphria's entry into the U.S. ahead of federal legalization of cannabis to fuel sustainable profitable growth

I recently made a post in regards to [The Rolling 20’s - LEAPs on Cannabis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lab9sk/the_rolling_20s_leaps_on_cannabis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) where I highlight long term opportunities the marijuana industry presents with US legalization on the horizon. This is happeneing at an extreme rate & Aphria will be positioning itself as a top tier brand in the US through SweetWater.

[Proof of Concept](https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Aphria-Inc.-November-2020-AGM-Presentation-FINAL.pdf)

**Broken Coast Brew** - *The best of the bud in the best of the brews*
>Inspired by the one and only Broken Coast, these small batch craft brews will have you saying “woah”. Packed with incredible earthy, dank and complex cannabis-inspired flavours you’ll feel the sea breeze in no-time. (Pg.25)

**RIFF** – *Loud without the cloud*
>Not for the un-inspired, RIFF’s brew masters bring the house down. Hoppy, flavorful and aromatic our lineup brings the party to wherever you are. Join us in this joint effort and run the show with these flavour-packed brews. (Pg.26)

**Solei Hard Seltzer** – *it is always sunny with Solei*
>There is no time to enjoy the sunshine like every time. Solei’s hard seltzers are created with the perfect combination of freshness and crisp flavours. Made with sun-kissed fruits, Solei Hard Seltzer brings the sun all year round. (Pg.27)

I wouldn’t be surprised to see the Solei concept featured on SweetWaters newly released [Premium Hard Seltzer](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210125005211/en/SweetWater-Releases-Oasis%C2%AE-Premium-Hard-Seltzer) at some point.

In addition to its traditional distribution footprint, SweetWater 420 Extra Pale Ale and IPA are served on all Delta flights nationwide plus internationally totaling more than 50 countries across six continents which has served to extend SweetWater's brand reach on both a national and international level. The Company also hosts an annual music festival, ""SweetWater 420 Fest,"" that has evolved into one of the largest and most anticipated music festivals in the U.S., increasing brand awareness nationwide.

This move creates a branded cannabis lifestyle Products Company with a diverse revenue base. I strongly encourage everyone to look into the management on both sides and come to your own conclusions. I also made a post about about the Aphria/Tilray merger, feel free to check it out:

**Push and Pull**

1/27 onwards it seems traders have got involved heavily and while short ratio has remained consistent  (>50%), most of the volume is downtrading suggesting paper hands are being shaken out. As data suggest, new short positions were opened at peak price on 1/27 . While, Most of the squeeze happened with heavy volume in first round. I guess, the question to ask is what is required to trigger second round.

1) buy volume increase / reduced short sale ratio ? ( fellow retards currently waiting for account transfers)

2) Failure to delivery deadlines approaching ?

3) More good news from management/board, RC etc.

Short Stocks and Dividend Payments 

Shorting a stock is essentially selling it and then buying it back at a future price.

1 -﻿ If the price falls, there is a profit. If the price rises to $512.00 there is a LOSS. The stock needs to be BORROWED from a shareholder to sell it without owning it. A brokerage firm usually handles this process. There is generally a borrowing fee for the stock, depending on its availability and liquidity. Additionally, the borrower of the stock is responsible for paying any DIVIDENDS.

&#x200B;

2﻿ - If an investor is short a stock on the record date, they are NOT entitled to the dividend.

&#x200B;

3 -﻿ In fact, the investor is instead responsible for PAYING the dividend owed to the lender of the shorted stock that they borrowed.

Special Considerations:

Shorting stocks are considered RISKY and appropriate only for sophisticated traders (MELVIN IS A DUMBASS) due to the general upward trend of stocks, borrowing costs, and the skewed risk-reward nature of shorting. Over time, stocks appreciate as inflation erodes the value of currencies. Companies, through their business operations, protect against inflation as they can pass on rising costs to customers. This is one reason for the general upward trajectory of stock indexes over time.

&#x200B;

Borrowing costs can be significant depending on the stock, typically between 2% and 10% annually. **30% in exceptional cases**.

&#x200B;

4﻿ -﻿ Of course, there is the additional cost of paying out DIVIDENDS. This is a significant drag on returns and compounds the difficulty of the task. Finally, **BASIC MATH** works against short selling as well. A stock can go up by multiples if there is a takeout offer or the company comes out with some INNOVATIVE product.

I'm a fucking retard and have no idea what I'm taking about. I like this stonk.

Corsair Gaming ($CRSR)

*Redefining gaming, eSports, and streaming*

Company Overview

Corsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California.

They acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market, Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom-built PC systems and console controllers markets, respectively, and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam, and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market.

Corsair went public on September 23, 2020, with its IPO priced at $17, valuing the company at about $1.3B.

Understanding the Business

**Value Proposition**

Corsair provides specialized, high-performance gear for gamers and streamers. Their products are designed to provide speed and reliability for competitive gaming, high quality content for streamers, and powerful PC components that allows gamers to run modern games smoothly.

**Revenue Streams**

Currently, Corsair groups its product offering into two segments: gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems.

Gamer and Creator Peripherals:

which represents around 25% of net revenue, includes gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets, streaming gear, and high performance console controllers.

Gaming Components Systems:

which represents around 75% of net revenue includes computer cases, power supply units (PSU), high performance memory products (40% of net revenue), and custom-built gaming systems.

Acquisitions and Partnerships:

During 3Q 2020 Corsair acquired Gamer Sensei, a gaming coaching platform, EpocCam, an app that allows iPhones to serve as a webcam, and partnered with Pipeline, a course-based education platform for streamers.

Industry

**Market Size**

According to Jon Peddie Research, the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach $40B by the end of 2020. Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.

Additionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.

**Industry Fundamentals**

Growth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.

Popularity of gaming is increasing:

According to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.

Tech-driven improvements in game quality:

Advances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.

Increasing gaming and streaming engagement:

Some interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks’ State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:

* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games
* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves
* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive
* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.

**The eSports and streaming flywheel**

The rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.

Competitive Landscape & Risks

**Competition**

The gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair’s product offering includes:

**Gaming keyboards and mice** \- Logitech and Razer

**Headsets and related audio products** \-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX

**Streaming gear** \- Logitech and AVerMedia

**Performance controllers** \- Microsoft and Logitech

**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake

**High performance memory** \- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron

**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower

**Competitive Strategy**

The company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.

**Market Share**

According to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.

**Growth Strategy**

Move into the Asia Pacific region:

The Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.

Complimentary acquisitions:

Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.

New Markets:

Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.

**Threat of New Entrants**

Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).

**Threat of Substitution**

A significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair’s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.

Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user’s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.

According to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.

Additionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.

**Moats**

There does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair’s market share across their product offering.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

First, in regards to Nokia’s business. Nokia, unfortunately, doesn’t manufacturer phones anymore. Nokia sold the right to produce Nokia branded phones to HMD Global while retaining the right to have some input. Nokia’s current business concentrates on mobile networks such as 5G, network infrastructures, and cloud services. In other words, Nokia business pertains to the most basic component of our modern civilization. Especially so the Post-COVID world where networking is even more important than before. Think of the Tesla cars. They are connected to AT&T cellular networks which are built by Nokia. Nokia will be leading the networks that would eventually enable automation. And when that happens, Nokia will have a continuous revenue stream.

Nokia is leading mobile networks with 27% of the world (excluding China) market share of 4G and 5G. It currently holds more than 3000k patents for 5G. Nokia other major competitors are Ericson, Huawei, and ZTE. Some countries of the Western hemisphere and the G7 banned Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE from operating in their countries. I suspect this will continue in the future. Leaving us with only Nokia and Ericson. But couldn’t a Mega-Cap such as Google or Tesla somehow eliminate NOK and ERIC? NOK holds more than 3000 patents already. So there is a strong barrier of entry into such a business. That won’t happen unless Nokia licences a patent for such a company. In this hypothetical scenario, the Mega-Cap would have to acquire Nokia. Which in turn will raise the price of the stock. I think this is the case that is similar to MSFT under Ballmer’s where the stock price was stagnant for many years. But slowly surged under Nadella. Though given the catalyst of COVID-19, I think the surge will happen quicker with NOK.

At 4.53 a share. NOK P/E ratio is 30.81x. Which is a small discount in comparison with the S&P 500 which has P/E ration of about 39x. This establishes Nokia not only as a growth stock but also as a value stock. The lowest that NOK dropped to was 2.34. Which happened back in March. At the current price, I believe that NOK is well within the margin of safety. 

With that being said, there are some problems that should be addressed. The income trend in the past few years is problematic. But this can offset by the fact that NOK has contracts well into the future with many nations states and private companies that should generate ample income until NOK is able to eliminate Huawei and ZTE and in turn, dominate the market (With Ericson). Also, Nokia is spening billions on research 

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-proximus/nokia-wins-5g-contract-from-proximus-luxembourg-idUSKBN28P0WJ 

The second complication is that Biden or other G7 leaders could potentially reverse Trump’s ousting of Huawei and ZTE. I don’t think this is likely. But it’s certainly a possibility. But even if it happens. Nokia will still have a big market share. And 100% market share of the moon and will always have a priority over Huawei and ZTE for government projects for reasons of national security. Also, there is a substantial amount of money spent on R&D which will I believe will be a catalyst in the future surge in NOK.

It should be worth noting that just one day after RH banned NOK, Blackrock released an amendment to their ownership of NOK. Increasing their shares by  21,140,777 shares.

Even though at this point Blackrock owns 5% of practically everything. The increase is a good question. 

Now you might ask me why not Ericson? ERIC is also a good stock. But I see more value in NOK. Also, the fact the NOK is working on 1 Terabit per second internet, and that it will bring 4G to the moon, and the fact that Nokia is #1 by patterns give it an edge in innovative growth.

I love ford, my first car I personally bought was a Ford Fusion.

Position Disclosure: 20 $F 11$ calls for 2/5, 6 $IDEX 5$ calls 3/19

There's a fireside chat this Thursday where they lay out their EV strategy but here's why I'm in safe calls

1. Ford outsells NIO and TSLA byyy farrrr!
2. Partnership with Rivian isn't forgotten and a team committed for a futuristic EV design (more people like how the All-Electric Ford F150 looked compared to the Tesla Cybertruck (and won it in a tug-of-war battle recently) 
3. GM is trading at more than 4x the price of F (buying Nikola and faking a EV Hummer video)
4. Back in 2014, the Ford navigation was using $MSFT Cortana's voice for their entertainment / engagement. I'm sure $MSFT wanted to partner with Ford but had to settle something like $GM because it was already talking with $GOOG (which has most chance of creating driverless cars).
5.  Ford unlocked it's CANbus that year and let developers go to town with their apps. For a moment their cars were used by $UBER and some private researchers in their driverless fleet

It's not gonna move to $50 but it definitely has potential to reach $20 imo.

Dear diary,

Last week we had seen some shit in the market. Brokers shut down the American free market for some time. The whole world talked about us at first, but then the attacks began.

We were marked as market manipulators. However, we had support. By millionaires, billionaires and politicians. Soon we weren’t market manipulators anymore, but people who saved businesses.

However, the HF were smart. They had a crisis meeting and changed the narrative. They took positions in SLV and then called their friend at the news outlets. They changed the narrative from a GME squeeze to a silver squeeze. The whole day everybody on mainstream media talked about fucking SLV. But we kept strong, we fought the fake news with facts until they stopped talking about it. During this attack we lost some men who switched to SLV.

However, then Friday came. The HF started their short ladder attacks. At first we did not recognize these attacks. We didn’t know how to defend ourselves, then to stay together, buy the dips and shut our eyes from the reds. A lot of options were in the call and it costed them millions.

The HF called all their quants this weekend. They picked some PhD students from Harvard, Stanford and Oxford and made their plans. They did the math, analysed WSB and then knew what to do: *WSB grew from 2.2 million to 8.4 million in a week. Most of these people are not retarded enough to hold the stocks if they lose 5%. So lets continue the short ladder attacks and let them fear the big money.*

And that’s what happened on Monday. They regrouped and started the attack… We lost a lot of apes on Monday. Then the second attack on Tuesday. I must say, I almost cried. A lot of people left the fight. They told their wife’s boyfriends that he will become a millionaire, but lost a couple of hundreds, so they left the fight. At the end of the day there were only a couple of diamond handed people left. Moral is low. On twitter we called for our Daddy Ryan Cohen, however, no response…

But then the post of u/DFV. After topping an unrealized return of 48 million, he lost approximately half during this weeks fight. He came with his post and showed us that he will continue the fight with or without us. The most loyal to DFV and GME are staying now. Me too. DFV showed me how to become rich, he gave me a taste, something I never had. Now, I will stay until the end.

This reminds me of the fight of the 300 Spartans against the Persians. During the first fights everybody stayed and fought successfully. But then when King Leonidas wanted to continue for freedom and respect, a majority of his soldiers left. Only the most loyal and strong stayed. This is us now in this moment. The loyal and strong Spartans are the Diamond Hands. Our king is DFV and our fight is against the strong HF. We might die, but that does not matter. Because in the end we showed them our strength and saved GME.

BTW Mods, maybe make a motivation flair?

The captain got hurt during the fight. He retreated with his paperhands fighters. It took a while, but he told the story of the dapper and mightly King Leonidas and his diamond hand soldiers. He came back with the greatest and largest army yet and defeated the Persians. 

Yes wait, our captain is Ryan. He will come to help us. He wouldnt just meme some on twitter and leave us alone.

You think that holding will make it squeeze. But holding is not enough. The price needs to increase to create a squeeze, so you need to buy.

Last weeks were exceptional. Market makers were unprepared (gamma squeeze) and had to buy stock, which helped increase the price. That won't happen again.

Since market makers won't help your cause (buy), you have to do it yourself. But you all agree that it is priced above fundamental value. So basically you want people to buy an overvalued stock, in the hope that other people buy into an even more overvalued stock.

I was fun while it lasted. I wish the outcome was different and that the price would have gone to $1000+, but the momentum was killed on Thursday.

There is not a next GME. That's not a thing, so stop saying it is. Okay, with that out of the way here we go:

Last week on January 24th, Nancy Pelosi's husband disclosed buying 4 different tickers. The tickers were TSLA, AAPL, DIS, and AB. Most of the mainstream media were very focused on talking about the TSLA, AAPL, and DIS yet only very briefly mention the fact he bought 20,000 shares of AB. I found this particular stock pick very odd in comparison to TSLA, AAPL, and DIS. It's an odd pick because

A. I hadn't ever heard of ticker AB before reading this story. And

B. Paul Pelosi bought deep ITM calls on TSLA, AAPL, and DIS. AKA calls any smooth brain could make. These calls are super safe long term plays, and require no brain power or risk for how deep in the money they are. In comparison to those three companies, he bought SHARES of AB. I found this extremely odd. For those reasons, I began to look into the company to attempt to see why he made this purchase in particular.

After non-extensive research I came to two different possible conclusions why he would buy shares of AB with as high conviction as TSLA, AAPL, and DIS:

1. He liked the high dividend yield of 7.72% and the slow yet steady upward projectory of the stock. OR
2. He knows something I don't.

So, because I am retarded I went with number 2 and YOLO'd 30 Apr 19 45$ calls @ .50 cent strike price. I will hold these calls with diamond hands and we'll see what happens.

The results must have been known since mit December and substantial parts of the results already in November! Remember the last person for phase 1 was recruited in November and primary completion of the study in early December !

And again - phase 1 is an open label study (no blinding for anybody !). Vaxart knows the data the very moment when their laboratory machines give their results (e.g neutralising antibody titers from an ELISA Test)

Vaxart must know the results since many weeks.

Why does it take so long? Phase 1 is a relatively small study. The reason is the talks which are behind the scene. While we get Hamster results, I am confident that Vaxart had several meetings with OWS and WHO COVAX committee talking about large multi hundred million dose production.

It is only consistent that Vaxart is hiring so many highly qualified and well paid staff as indicated on their website: all prepared for large scale production. Contractor is secured as well. All is set.

I would not even exclude that we may not get phase 1 results today before the conference if anything is still to be negotiated between Vaxart and OWS or Vaxart and WHO. This could even further delay the announcement.

It is also possible that we first get phase 1 results today before the NY Academie of science meeting and then followed in some days by OWS and/or WHO announcement.

Whether attributed to more retail investor involvement, stimulus from the government, lack of spending elsewhere, the Fed, etc, some companies are the chosen ones for the high valuations while others don't get the privilege of being among WallStreet's favored.

&#x200B;

For the apes / autists in the group, company valuation is also called the market cap. It's the share price \* outstanding shares (not just float shares).

&#x200B;

GME Market Cap (Valuation) at $300/share assuming the number of outstanding shares is constant, would roughly be $21b ($300 \* 69.75M shares).  The main metric to compare companies valuation justification is the EPS or earnings per share. This is often just called a multiple. That is, if the EPS is $1 for the year, the PE is 300 at a $300/share price.

&#x200B;

Generally, companies within the same industry would have similar PE ratios but it depends if it's been blessed or not by the WallStreet powers.

&#x200B;

According to CIS Market, the average PE ratio for Internet, Mail Order, and Online Shops is 77.13 with the retail sector overall at 47.36. Ulta Beauty Inc (ULTA) which is an in-person salon retail has a wopping 72.42 valuation with an annual consensus of $3.94 EPS. Source: [https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry\_Valuation.php?s=1300](https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry_Valuation.php?s=1300).

&#x200B;

Now GME does have some baggage in that it hasn't had a profitable year in 3 years with the pandemic really hurting it. In addition, its debt to assets ratio has been steadily rising since 2017 to as high as 87% as of Q3 2020. But, the turn around has been looking good with it's profit margins as well increasing and the last EPS of -$0.29 was a massive surprise to the estimate of -$0.85. The consensus for the year is -$2.07. But when there is a mass pandemic and people aren't shopping, I would say this is pretty good all things considering.

&#x200B;

🚀🚀🚀🚀Now, given Ryan Cohen's appointment in helping the company make a more digital transformation, the challenge will be capital. Innovation and growth costs. GameStop has a lot of assets though in the form of real estate. If they are able to reduce costs while growing their digital footprint both through game services like Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, or Steam, and eCommerce sales for older nostalgia games, they could very well reach $3-$5 EPS within a couple of years (that is roughly $0.75 - $1.25 per quarter). At a $4 EPS (in between the two), this is only a 75 PE ratio which is not farfetched at all especially inline with the Internet / Online Shops industry as the company reinvents itself. While debt will continue to be a drag on the company in the short-term, I think there is plenty of opportunity for GME to innovate here. 🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

What Wall Street doesn't want you to see is that they've valued and supported bullishly many other companies at high valuations. TSLA P/E ratio is 1,380.65 whereas the current auto industry PE is 20.4. Toyota is 14.86. Even some of Wall Street called TSLA the 4-WTF Chart of the year - [https://wolfstreet.com/2020/12/12/tesla-the-quadruple-wtf-chart-of-the-year-it-should-just-sell-shares-on-autopilot-at-huge-prices-and-exit-sordid-business-of-making-cars/](https://wolfstreet.com/2020/12/12/tesla-the-quadruple-wtf-chart-of-the-year-it-should-just-sell-shares-on-autopilot-at-huge-prices-and-exit-sordid-business-of-making-cars/), but alas all the bears have kinda called it quits on TSLA with short interest at it's all time low. The valuation doesn't scare them with price targets above $1k. The difference?

I know a lot of you are looking for confirmation that you should still hold, the truth is that may or may not be in your best interest. Only you can decide will all the information you have what’s best. Don’t listen to random people online.

However I’m going to let you know why I’m still holding. I bought in with a average price of $56 and a lot of the shares bought below $100 will be held by people who haven’t sold yet and aren’t planning on. Institutions and smart investors with a good amount of shares (*200+*) are currently holding, mostly paper hands (people who jumped on because of media/word of mouth) are gone now and they most likely didn’t have a big amount of shares anyway. We also temporarily lost swing traders because of the restrictions and loss of momentum, people with big balances who seen big dips as swinging opportunities (*$124 to $300 for example*) yes they sell but when they buy it brings pressure back and the price up which brings confidence for other people to invest in. I still think SI is high and HF aren’t out the game yet. With how high the SI is and the low float I think we would have seen a lot more volume on Wednesday/Thursday/Friday. The whole world was buying so this kind of volume to me even if it was HF unloading dosent signal them unwinding. 

*So what’s the game plan?*

Well firstly I think the HF couldn’t have let the whole world buy shares and have a short squeeze, they would be in to much debt and the price may very well have gone past $2000 due to a massive amount of people buying (*people normally not involved in stocks*) and the HF would of become insolvent. What I think the HF did is allow retail to buy during the week with Melvin unwinding their position, then once retail buying pressure starts to decrease due to people already in the stock, start to coordinate together with other HFs to restrict buying on some brokers (*decrease buying pressure*) and slow down the momentum caused by the internet and people talking about the squeeze. They would then let people sell and induce FUD which changed the narrative and worked, the price is now at a more comfortable level for them $90. On the 09/02/21 we will see latest SI (*2 weeks ago date*) and I’m assuming it will still be over 100%. They will try to bring price as low as they can but there will be a people with large amount of shares bought early they won’t fold (*some can’t sell*). When good earnings come out and in addition to Cohen turning the company around and increasing the valuation until fair price is $100. 

Then we may see the HFs unwind and the short squeeze would happen, at a much lower price for them as to not have to buy back shares at $500+ also with less people involved (*retail got bored/lost too much money and isn’t financially involved with GME*) there will be less competition to buy shares. They don’t want the whole world’s eyes on them during the squeeze. This is a waiting game for institutions and smart money. If you have the money and time to hold it would be smart or to make a position at there’s prices would also be smart. We wait for Cohen to turn the company around which would tell everyone who’s shorting this company that it will be fair valued at $100 and they (*shorts*) would not be able to bankrupt the company or get the share price back to where they or originally shorted it.

TL;DR - HF still have to initiate MOASS. Not yet though people need to hold for Cohen to take action and creat a positive outlook for the company, HF wouldn’t want to pay interest on a company whose valuation will be going up for years. They would unwind.

Reading this you will learn: 
1. $BBBY has a constant uptrend 
2. $BBBY has staying power 
3. $BBBY’s uptrend will continue through the Summer and possibly Fall 
4. $BBBY stock will not only give you a Short Squeeze opportunity, But is has long value of 10% in 6 months over its current price



AT ITS CURRENT PRICE $BBBY HAS LONG TREND VALUE (EVEN AT 6 MONTHS). During this Cycle (which I’m starting after the Covid correction in March) $BBBY has had a fairly constant Uptrend that, even after the first January correction, has a trend that still lines up with the troughs on the higher-low line: https://imgur.com/dhbfPzw


$BBBY is a healthy company, but so called ‘smart money’ thinks there is going to be a downturn in home goods when the Covid stuff ends. Buying home goods during the Stay-at-Home orders is what they call “Nesting.” which is why so many of them shorted the stock, but $BBBY will be fine for at least the next 6 months, or even 9 months. We’re not going to be leaving our houses for the next few months anyways, which will continue the “Nesting” trend for another good quarter or two, and it will take investors a few down quarters to start frowning on $BBBY. So that means current investors are HOLDING. That brings the trend price based on the higher-low line to about $33 in July, 10%+ where the current stock price is at: https://imgur.com/ml6swYO


NOW HERE’S THE BEST PART: Most Apes on here who pay attention know that this stock is shorted by 65%. Here’s a list if you’re new: https://imgur.com/Nm4hsxQ


Of all the companies on this list, $BBBY is the only one with a very healthy trend line compared to it’s current stock price. Even at a stock price between $25-$30, which is above $BBBY’s current ‘Higher-Low’ trend line, in 5 months $BBBY will be worth $33. There is still a 10% growth there. A LOT OF RETAIL AND INSTUTIONAL INVESTORS ARE HIP TO THIS, AND THEY LIKE THE STOCK, SO THEY ARE HOLDING!


If another GME Sort-Squeeze is going to go KABOOM on another stock, its probably going to happen to $BBBY and soon. The last settlement date for shorts was on Friday with 51 Million shares, but have 11 days to cover. The Next settlement date, Monday, February 14th, 62.5 million shares have only 5 days to cover. On February 28th, 64 million shares will need to be settled with only 5 days to cover. https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bbby/short-interest


If $BBBY is a healthy stock that has a current price under $30 and a long price of $33 for July 2021 (10%+ its current value), it’s being shorted at 62%, retail and intuitional investors are holding, and 126million+ shares are going to have to be settled by the end of February….


Here’s my observations on why Bed Bath & Beyond $BBBY stock is going to be healthy for a long time. I call them the “Doubles”:


DOUBLE THE AMOUNT GATHERINGS AT OTHER PEOPLE’S HOMES IN 2021! “Hedge Fund” belief is that when the pandemic is over there is going to be a mad desire for larger than life gatherings like Concerts and such. That is true, but there’s going to be long ramp up period for that. However, a year full of missed birthday parties, anniversary parties, retirement parties, youth sport team parties, divorce parties, dessert and campaign parties (these are actually pretty fun. I don’t drink btw, I go for the deserts), cookout for the hell of it parties, etc… are going to happen at an accelerated Rate in 2021. Did you know Bed Bath & Beyond sells party supplies? I’m not talking about just paper plates and napkins; I’m talking about serving platters, serving utensils, electric food warming trays, beverage tubs, margarita machines, kegerators, bathroom towels, random stuff to make your house look nicer when guests come over… all the stuff someone would want for a party.
People don’t have time to wait for an online order to show up when they’re preparing for a party, especially if they need those items the day of. So they go to the store to get it when they think about it.


DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF EXTENDED STAYS AT FAMILY AND FRIEND’S HOMES! Long distance family and friends haven’t seen each other IN PERSON for a long time and reunions are going to be #1 on peoples travel list. Couch surfing and guest rooms are going to be the top destination for most people in 2021. Smart Money thinks there are a ton people out there with the money spend on Cruises and trips to Disneyland? Hogwash! People are going to be visiting their family “Back Home” or traveling to Boston so their 4-year-old daughter can meet her cousins in person. And the hosts for these guest roomers and couch surfers are going to update their hospitality amenities (such as clean sheets, towels, toothbrush holders). Many of them wont have time to wait for an online delivery; they’re going to need those items NOW. And where will they update guest hospitality items right now? BED BATH AND BEYOND!


DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF WEDDING REGISTRYS! All the weddings that got canceled last year are going to happen this year. Plus all the weddings that are supposed to happen this year are also going to happen this year. And do you know what is attached to all those damn Wedding Invitations? A Wedding Registry! And where are all of them registered at? BED BATH & BEYOND! May-August going to be Diamond Hands for them.
Here’s a great vomit-inducing article about the increase in weddings in 2021 & 2022 because people like links in these DDs: https://www.insider.com/weddings-will-be-more-expensive-after-pandemic-2022-2021-1


DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF STUFF FOR COLLEGE DORM ROOMS! A ton of new college kids didn’t move into their dorms last year which means double the tonnage of new college kid will be moving in this year. And those college kids are going to need sheets, blankets, pillows, towels, shower caddys, lamps, etc… And Mom is going to want to shop with their kid to buy that stuff together. Andy where are they going to shop for that? BED BATH & BEYOND


WORK FROM HOME IS HERE TO STAY! Sure, you might say people already stocked up home stuff during the lockdown and that buying binge is over. ITS NOT OVER –ITS NOW HERE TO STAY! And when you get squirrely stuck at home with nothing to do, sometime you go out and buy stuff for your home. Its like: “You know what I need? A new coffeemaker. Lets go get one right now.” Or, “Remember how so and so’s dishes all matched each other, lets go get some matching dishes right now.” When squirrely hits, you aren’t going to wait around for an online delivery, you’re going to go get it NOW.


 $BBBY is a good stock. The company is liquid, there is a need for their goods, and they offer convenience for immediate purchases. Plus, lots of people and companies already own the stock with no intention of selling. Its financial stability, firm upward trend, and staying power already have it as a HOLD or LONG by 4 out of 5 reporting agencies, which is what conservative money looks at. Bed Bath & Beyond is already reported to have a good quarterly report coming next week, plus all the variables I laid out are going to continue the company’s positive earnings for the year.


Oh yea, some Key company factors: 
1. As per their last report they got $2.2 billion in the bank. They’re Liquid 
2. 15 million have downloaded their store app 
3. 2.2 million new online customers last year 
4. Other important financials that IDK what they’re about 
5. They dumped all their subsidiaries and now just focus on one thing, Convenient Home Goods!

$SCHW just release its daily average trade summary for January 2021.

It has seen daily average trade growth from 5.13 million in October all the way to 10.3million by the end of January.

This number will continue to increase as retail investors growth continues to boom and upset traders on Etoro, Robinhood, Webull and Interactive broker flee to Vangaurd/Fidelity/TD/Schwab the few companies who didn't restrict trading.

**Revenue Sensitivity (daily average trades)**

Taken directly from their winter business update which was released online yesterday.

[https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schw\_2021\_winter\_business\_update\_020221.pdf](https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schw_2021_winter_business_update_020221.pdf)

Calculating revenue growth just on the daily average trades we can see that they will be experience increased revenues this quarter of:

10,326 - 6,543 (average daily trades for all last quarter) = 3,782/ 100 \* 60M = 2.2 Billion increase in revenues just as a result of increased daily trades. This is assuming the 10,326 daily trades stays flat for the rest of the quarter. I expect the daily trades to continue to rise as a result of increased retailer activity and market trend. Lets say 2.5 Billion increase as a result of retail investor growth.

To put this in perspective they reported 4.1 Billion in revenue in Q4 last quarter. If they are to report 6.5 Billion plus this stock will jump 30%+ next earnings. Combined with cost savings with the TD merger Net income will see a increase of over 100% from last quarter

**Margin Balances:**

Schwab had to restrict the use of margin balances on select stocks during the January boom as retail investors started to opt to use margin to increase their holdings and risk. Margin usage has seen a drastic increase per their Q4 statements and I expect Q1 to follow suit with continued growth.

https://preview.redd.it/h1ynetmr49f61.png?width=1510&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b5168388cfaa56beb84cfe670d1eceb4a1999bd

**Part 1 DD Summary:**

**Average Daily users:** 20% increase from the October 2020 numbers to December 2020 alone. The January numbers will even be substantially higher with TD Ameritrade and Schwab both reporting network strain due to the influx of new investors signing up last week to get into GME/AMC/BB. This trend wont be stopping anytime soon, the retail investor's strength is gaining. Just look at Wallstreetbets alone we had 2.2 million members as of Monday and now we are sitting at 7 million.

**Future/Longevity of Brokerages:**

Etoro, Webull and RH will be facing lawsuites and scrutiny as a result of their trade restrictions. Do you want your money sitting in a brokerage with possible liquidly issues as a result of lawsuites.

**Balance Sheet Strength:**

Schwab has the strongest balance sheet of any brokerage on the market. With Trillions of dollars under management. This means that they will not need to restrict purchasing power of shares when there are substantial new deposits.

**Quote directly from Mark Cuban's AMA:**

When you load back up, fight a broker with TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS in assets on their balance sheet. Someone that can be there when the fight starts and wont blink an eye.

**GME and AMC Round 2**

For any future short squeeze traders will need to transfer their accounts to Schwab/TD/Fidelity to make sure their are no trade restrictions and bullshit manipulation. Schwab/TD and Fidelity are the only brokerages who have strong enough balance sheets to support future potential squeezes.

**Monthly Activity Report**

Schwab releases monthly activity report 2 weeks after the most recent month. This report will summarize daily trade growth, new deposits, new brokerage accounts. This report is expected in the next 2 weeks. Most likely on the 15th. $SCHW will explode similar to what IBKR did this week when these results are issued. This is your chance to get in cheap with $SCHW trading at 15% of its high and 25% off its recent price targets which were issued prior to this retail growth frenzy.

**TLDR:** Schwab is undervalued thanks to market sell off and will fly come February 15th when January activity report is released. It will run back to its ATH's in the mid 60s thanks to new customer deposits/transfers from shit brokerages and daily trade growth. 

I expected Schwab to report revenue of 6.5B plus this quarter or a 50% increase from prior quarter with net income increasing 50-100% as a result of the TD merger cost synergies. This stock will be trading at over $100 come earnings in April

Calls are cheap.

SweetWater Brewing Company is a craft brewery founded in 1997 by Freddy Bensch and Kevin McNerney in Atlanta, Georgia. SweetWater's beers are unpasteurized and distribution is limited to select states

SweetWater recently annouced that their beer will [be available in 27 states with Western Expansion](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210121005247/en/SweetWater-Brewing-Company-Reaches-New-Heights-Launching-Statewide-in-Colorado-February-1)

>SweetWater’s expansion into the first U.S. state to legalize recreational marijuana comes shortly after its [November 2020 acquisition](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-inc-announces-strategic-entry-into-the-united-states-with-an-agreement-to-acquire-sweetwater-brewing-company-301166616.html) by Aphria Inc

Irwin simon, the CEO of Aphria, has a track record for aggressive expansion. He brings a unique background who specializes in M&As. Aphria’s recent acquisition of SweetWater was a strategic play to expand into US & more importantly, creating brand awareness. 

>We will establish and grow our U.S. presence through SweetWater's robust, profitable platform of craft brewing innovation, manufacturing, marketing and distribution expertise. At the same time, we will build brand awareness for our adult-use cannabis brands, Broken Coast, Good Supply, Riff and Solei, through our participation in the growing $29 billion craft brew market in the U.S. ahead of potential future state or federal cannabis legalization

**US Trademarks**

Aphria proactively filed US Trademarks for a number of their brands:

[Broken Coast](https://uspto.report/TM/90383411)

[Riff](https://uspto.report/TM/90383302)  

[Solei](https://uspto.report/TM/90383374)

Irwin is leveraging SweetWater's existing infrastructure to accelerate Aphria's entry into the U.S. ahead of federal legalization of cannabis to fuel sustainable profitable growth

I recently made a post in regards to [The Rolling 20’s - LEAPs on Cannabis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lab9sk/the_rolling_20s_leaps_on_cannabis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) where I highlight long term opportunities the marijuana industry presents with US legalization on the horizon. This is happeneing at an extreme rate & Aphria will be positioning itself as a top tier brand in the US through SweetWater.

[Proof of Concept](https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Aphria-Inc.-November-2020-AGM-Presentation-FINAL.pdf)

**Broken Coast Brew** - *The best of the bud in the best of the brews*
>Inspired by the one and only Broken Coast, these small batch craft brews will have you saying “woah”. Packed with incredible earthy, dank and complex cannabis-inspired flavours you’ll feel the sea breeze in no-time. (Pg.25)

**RIFF** – *Loud without the cloud*
>Not for the un-inspired, RIFF’s brew masters bring the house down. Hoppy, flavorful and aromatic our lineup brings the party to wherever you are. Join us in this joint effort and run the show with these flavour-packed brews. (Pg.26)

**Solei Hard Seltzer** – *it is always sunny with Solei*
>There is no time to enjoy the sunshine like every time. Solei’s hard seltzers are created with the perfect combination of freshness and crisp flavours. Made with sun-kissed fruits, Solei Hard Seltzer brings the sun all year round. (Pg.27)

I wouldn’t be surprised to see the Solei concept featured on SweetWaters newly released [Premium Hard Seltzer](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210125005211/en/SweetWater-Releases-Oasis%C2%AE-Premium-Hard-Seltzer) at some point.

In addition to its traditional distribution footprint, SweetWater 420 Extra Pale Ale and IPA are served on all Delta flights nationwide plus internationally totaling more than 50 countries across six continents which has served to extend SweetWater's brand reach on both a national and international level. The Company also hosts an annual music festival, ""SweetWater 420 Fest,"" that has evolved into one of the largest and most anticipated music festivals in the U.S., increasing brand awareness nationwide.

This move creates a branded cannabis lifestyle Products Company with a diverse revenue base. I strongly encourage everyone to look into the management on both sides and come to your own conclusions. I also made a post about about the Aphria/Tilray merger, feel free to check it out:

Look at the Pluto TV acquisition from VIAC and you see the winner winner chicken dinner, WS is betting on the wrong streaming play with Netflix, look at the future of streaming and subscription fatigue. Pluto TV is the cure. There has been a lot of press and DD but no one is paying attention, investor day is 23 days away. After 2-24 no one will doubt the future of streaming and the fast partnership with Netflix and narcos proves it. I don’t think NFLX is a bad play. I did last year and was wrong but if you look at their current path to profitability it intersects hard with Pluto tv and Viacomcbs production capacity for streaming additional content. 

from the library licensing deals to the possibility of a new Chapelle show on Netflix owned in part by viac as part of a big deal with Dave to the Pluto TV Narcos deal cited in the last earnings call we can see a huge leap forward for streaming overall based entirely on the NFLX VIAC relationship. Monetization is a long term process for some of these pieces of big content and after a period of time it will no longer add new subs like narcos. 

But Pluto Tv can help with ad based monetization and no sub or sign in required. If you look at the overall package we see  that more shows could follow like ozark or maybe a sopranos channel for syndication like monetization a&e tried with no cursing but fuck that shit. 

If you missed the point don’t feel bad your like most of Wall Street today. VIAC is value in plain sight and it’s a growth stock in a hyper growth sector. We won’t see another streaming opportunity like this. After investor day on 2-24 the world will realize what has been silently growing for years. This is a huge opportunity and I’ve posted my positions before but I will again.
