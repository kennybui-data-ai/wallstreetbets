[Top 15 Options Activity from Friday \(1\/29\/2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/50atl3uc1pe61.png?width=1373&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e0b4faeda15be0c6e6cf70d0dff3a1bd9d01b0a)

Due to the exponential increase in membership in WSB I have started to see a lot of misinformation, favoritism, and overall divisiveness going on within the community. I decided to do my own Due Diligence (DD) to determine which stocks I will be holding next week, and hopefully this can start up a meaningful conversation in the comment section to help out our new friends who mostly want to know what to invest in.  I pulled the top 15 stocks with the greatest Options Volume from Friday (1/29). You can see all 4 of the $BANG stocks make this list. Despite understanding that GME is a heavily shorted stock with a Short Float greater than 100%, it is important to look at the Put Volume as well. This is the numbers of option contracts that are shorting the stock. GameStop is the only company of the batch that has a Short Float of greater than 100%, which is why this short squeeze is working so well, but it’s also the most heavily shorted on the options side. I think it’s important to see all 4 of the BANG stocks are heavily shorted on the put side too. If you look up who is buying these Put Contracts, it is mostly big institutional investors, whose best interest is to artificially depress the stock price so their puts pay out (look at what happened to BB and NOK on Thursday and Friday). This is why we have to stand together as a community and embrace the $BANG index that we created.

**GME** \- This is a short squeeze. Not much to say here. Buy, hold, don’t sell.

**BB** \- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. 66% of the float (shares available) are owned by institutional investors, so while the float might seem big (550M), we are only dealing with 34% of the shares. Buy, hold, don’t sell.

**AMC** \- Also a short squeeze. The Short float isn’t above 100% but this is still a great potential candidate.

**NOK** \- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. This is the weirdest one to me because everyone was claiming this was “bot” propaganda last week and then has the 3rd highest option volume on Friday. Not sure how to feel about this one, but hey its popular.

**Defining some terms:**

**Short Float:** Percentage of shorted shares in relation to the total number of floated shares (shares available to be traded)

**Options Volume:** Total number of **option** contracts bought and sold for the day

**% Put:** Percentage of total option contracts that are puts (think the stock will go down)

**% Call:** Percentage of total option contracts that are calls (think the stock will go up)

**Put/Call Ratio:** Ratio of puts to calls option contracts (higher the ratio, higher the short %)

I had my first 6 figure day in the market on Friday when NVAX went from 134 to 235 overnight after reporting great efficacy data. My weeklies were up 9000%, it was incredible. I want to send a thank you to u/Upstairs_Speech for his posts in the past, I would not have thought of the trade if it was not for him.

Now before you all tell me ""I wish I saw this before the stock went up 70%"" let me explain to you why this is still early innings. Sure, this might not be as sexy of a trade as round 1 was, but now that data concerns are off the table this thesis has a lot less risk. This one is more of a low risk, high growth play as opposed to a get rich quick one.

Let's do a mental exercise:

The day is December 31, 2020, everyone is excited to be moving on to 2021. NVAX share price hovers at $110, a $7B market cap awaiting UK phase 3 efficacy data. There are real concerns as to whether NVAX actually has a vaccine that works given their prior 30 years of failures. The market prices this risk accordingly and NVAX's market cap is only **17%** that of MRNA.

Fast forward 4 weeks. NVAX has released data on 20,000 patients, shows the highest efficacy of any vaccine against wild type COVID. NVAX shows strong efficacy against UK strain which no one else has. They show that the South Africa strain is a real concern with efficacy at 60%, and there is 0 reason to believe any vaccine will perform better against that strain. 

And I can't overstate this part enough, the **really** important detail here is that NVAX is the only protein vaccine on the horizon. The only other protein vaccine coming any time soon is MAYBE GSK/Sanofi and they already showed terrible data. They blamed it on dosing but there are major question marks there and they are delayed 6 months minimum. The reason protein vaccines are important is because they are the only ones that can offer coverage against multiple strains in a single shot. This is how the flu shot is done (which NVAX just passed phase 3 of in March). The flu shot is a protein vaccine that covers 4 strains in a single shot. What is becoming very clear is that we are going to need the same for COVID. The future of COVID vaccines is that in your annual shot you get coverage against wild type, SA strain and Brazil strain for example. NVAX is the **only** company that can do this right now. RNA vaccines are too reactive to handle multiple strains. You can already see how many symptoms people get with the current vaccine.

This [thread](https://twitter.com/PeterKolchinsky/status/1354929042965864451?s=20) is gold and helped me to understand the situation.

The market clearly has not digested this sufficiently yet. How do I know? Let's go back to the exercise from the beginning. Given NVAX's advancements in the last 4 weeks their market cap has doubled, up to 14B. What do you think Moderna has done in that same time frame when their COVID platform continues to weaken? Up 5%? 10%? 20%? They are up 67% in that same time frame! After everything that has happened NVAX still only has **20%** the market cap of MRNA. It basically hasn't even caught up. The reporting from mainstream media on NVAX was an abomination, especially compared to how they covered J&J's bad data. The truth will emerge. The market will realize it and will see NVAX is still deeply undervalued.

I am obviously not saying that NVAX will inevitably be as valuable or more valuable than MRNA. MRNA technology is very valuable and they are an extremely ambitious company. BUT, NVAX is about to play catch up due to the glaring discrepancy. In addition to COVID don't forget that NVAX has an incredible flu shot, likely at some point to be the first RSV vaccine ever and their Matrix M adjuvant is now very valuable. Quick recap of differences between the two vaccines:

My belief is that NVAX gets to a 20B market cap very soon (50% upside) and I can't imagine a world in which its not at 30B minimum by year end (100% upside). Upcoming catalysts are finalizing 200M dose deal with EU, emergency use authorization in the UK and other countries will quickly follow, production partnership with Merck or GSK/Sanofi and others.

IMO this week will be very telling, if it is up on Monday buy and don't think twice. If it pulls back maybe give it a couple days to get a better price on options as it might consolidate for a while.

**Positions:**

75% allocated to 1/21/22 280 calls. If it gets to 30B market cap by expiration its over a 300% return and I think market cap gets there by end of summer so it would be even more profitable. Don't mess with the July calls at this point, they are too expensive. You basically get the same value and more time going with next January. IMO this one is free money.

25% allocated to 4/16/21 240 calls. If it gets to 20B market cap by expiration this is a 150% return. I think there is a somewhat decent chance it could be there by the end of this week but we will see."|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|['NVAX']|['NVAX']|['I', 'I', 'NVAX', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'NVAX', 'B', 'UK', 'NVAX', 'MRNA', 'NVAX', 'COVID', 'NVAX', 'UK', 'I', 'NVAX', 'MAYBE', 'NVAX', 'COVID', 'COVID', 'SA', 'NVAX', 'RNA', 'I', 'B', 'COVID', 'NVAX', 'MRNA', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'I', 'NVAX', 'MRNA', 'MRNA', 'BUT', 'NVAX', 'COVID', 'NVAX', 'RSV', 'M', 'NVAX', 'B', 'I', 'B', 'M', 'EU', 'UK', 'IMO', 'B', 'I', 'IMO', 'B', 'I']|['NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX']

I am a fucking retard so my math is probably wrong, but if its not it proves that $DB is MASSIVELY overvalued and presents an enormous short opportunity for retail investors like ourselves. Also, it just happens to screw over one of the most evil and corrupt banks in the United States, if not the world. (They also have more than 300B in Debt)

Overshadowed by the recent infinite money glitch known as $GME and $AMC, $DB experienced THREE gigantic scandals in one week.

1. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-regulators-press-deutsche-bank-090221050.html?.tsrc=rss](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-regulators-press-deutsche-bank-090221050.html?.tsrc=rss)

Now that we are aware of the fraudulent and scammy work conducted by these assholes, lets analyze their share price.

**Current Share Price:** 10.12

**Historical (12 Month) Earnings Per Share:** \-0.89 (0.1 Q3 2020)

**Annual Sales:** 28.9B

**Annual Dividend per Share:** 0.10

**Historical Price/Earnings (Median):** 16.70

**Book Value Per Share:** 0.2939

([https://smallbusiness.chron.com/calculate-companys-stock-price-21802.html](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/calculate-companys-stock-price-21802.html))

I used two of the formulas presented in the above article Benjamin Graham & P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)

1. Projected Price using Benjamin Graham Formula

1a. SQR ((15)(1.5)(.1)(0.2939)) = 0.81 (actual value per share)

2. P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)

2a. ((16.70)(0.1)) = 1.67 (intrinsic value)

&#x200B;

This means the actual *value* of the stock is *Drumroll Please...*

Between  $0.81 - $1.67

&#x200B;

If my math is correct (and it probably isn't), then this means that Deutsche Bank's stock is MASSIVELY overvalued and is due for a market correction (hence the AMAZING shorting opportunity). Also, if I am wrong please correct me - I only would like to learn more about the market, so I can eventually lose $5,000,000 in an earnings call.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Current Price = 10.12

&#x200B;

I do not want to mess up the momentum of $GME or $AMC, I am only posting this because in the same way that we LIKE those stocks, I think we should also be open to DISLIKING some of the worst stocks on the market. Especially stocks with ties to CNBC and the other hedge fund assholes who have enslaved us with debt.

&#x200B;

I just got off a conference call with all your wives' boyfriends and I got some DD to drop on you. Everyone here knows about the big four stocks right now. If not, GTFO.

What I’m here to tell is to not focus 100% on these four and let other great opportunities pass you by. (Note – What I am NOT TELLING YOU is to sell your GME. Hodor that sh\*t). While you all have been foaming at he mouth over your GME games, you’ve likely missed what is going on with the rest of the market. Several great performing stocks have been dumping since this GME craze began. Oh, need examples?  To name a few you may have heard of: 

AAPL – Down 5.11% 

AMD – Down 7.7% 

BIDU – Down 7%

DOCU – Down 8.7%

F – Down 8.6%

PINS – Down 6.25%

NIO - down 8%

Wondering why this may be? Two theories They both might be right, or I might have a really smooth brain. 

1) These hedge funds everyone here is so keen on financially ruining need to cover their losses somehow. What better way than to liquidate stocks that have had crazy runs the last few months.  If this is true it will be extra enjoyable to watch them pay more to re-enter these positions when the stocks inevitably bounce back.

2) You people selling your shares in other stuff to buy more GME. (again, great job holding the line) I have seen several posts on here from other smooth brains selling their shares of some of those listed here. I applaud your enthusiasm for the cause and wish you the best. 

With these two combined, you end up with tons of shares dumping from these 401K stocks, with the buyers foaming at the mouth for more GME, NOK, AMC, BB. 

Once this is all over and the world of normies forget all about the GME madness, they are going to put their money back into their boomer stocks and standard 401K stocks. What does this mean for you? Don’t miss the dips happening all around you while the world is focused on 4 stocks and a shiba inu. If you have any extra money and cant afford GME, check out the rest of the market for buying opportunities. 

TLDR – Keep holding the line! If you have any money left, buy the dips on others for bonus tendies

Most of the takes on Robinhood are wrong. It’s a traffic jam. The same guard rails that are supposed to protect the plumbing of the system in an off ramp on the left side of the chart are slowing the system in the on ramp on the right side of the chart. You just can't open up millions of margin accounts a day trading stocks that move 300% a day. Even the most liquid brokerage quickly becomes very illiquid holding all the liable accounts. By Tuesday they will have enough liquidity and shares will have settled and retail will be able to buy en masse. Robinhood is the #1 app in the WORLD right now. This is only going to accelerate. They will get the plumbing right and add lines of credit. Credit markets are fine, so Robinhood can access capital. To the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀 

In addition, all the folks transferring accounts OUT of Robinhood cannot sell. It can take 3-5 days for a journal to clear. That is forced 💎🙌, which reduces the tradeable float of GameStop, increasing the short interest as a percentage of the float. 

We will see more buying pressure this week, forced holding by transfers, more institutional buying, and algorithms from quant funds like Renaissance Technologies analyzing everyone’s autistic thoughts, and following!!

**Breakdown of Restrictions by Brokerage: Worst to Best**

**RobinHood: (Worst)**

\- Trading restrictions limiting purchasing power to as little as 1-5 shares on over 50 stocks

[https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys)

\- Allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of GME and AMC during Thursday's trading rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\- Liquidity issues: RH is racing to raise 1$ billion from its existing investors as of Friday as many individuals are withdrawing their funds in protest of restrictions

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

**Interactive Brokers (garbage)**

\- Trading restrictions on GME/AMC/BB allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of these securities during Thursdays trading Rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\- CEO stated in CNBC interview they imposed restrictions to help out hedge funds (and stabilize the market)

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

**WeBull + ETrade (garbage)**

\- Trading restrictions on GME/AMC/BB allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of these securities during Thursdays trading Rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

**Schwab/TD Ameritrade (reasonable)**

\- Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\- Limiting short selling on volatile tickers (limiting trades with unlimited risk)

\- Raised margin requirements on many securities

\- Allowed trading of volatile securities once cash deposits were verified (many new accounts experienced this issue as new funds were not settled)

Both of these restrictions are reasonable as they have unlimited risk and are not trying to be liable for any substantial losses

**Fidelity/Vanguard (Best)**

\- Raised margin requirements on many securities

\- Limiting short selling on volatile tickers (limiting trades with unlimited risk)

Both of these restrictions are reasonable as they have unlimited risk and are not trying to be liable for any substantial losses

Thousands of upset retail investors will be fleeing RH, IBRK, Webull and Etrade over the next couple of weeks. Switching to Fidelity and Schwab/TD Ameritrade.

I would also go long Fidelity investments but it is not publicly traded.

**Schwab Analysis**

**User Growth:**

The amount of brand new retail investors opening up accounts over the past week is ridiculous. GME + AMC + BB pump has been blasted across every media station. Every online brokerage was experience server lag and strain over the past week due to the increased volume from new retail investors. Traffic on these sites were 3-4 times what they normally were during the recent trading frenzy.

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/schwab-vanguard-fidelity-suffer-service-problems-amid-trading-surge-51611773909?siteid=yhoof2](https://www.barrons.com/articles/schwab-vanguard-fidelity-suffer-service-problems-amid-trading-surge-51611773909?siteid=yhoof2)

RH/Webull/Etrade/IBRK transfers - many retail investors will be transferring over their accounts as a result of the trade restrictions and collusion with hedge funds. Listed below are the total accounts at each brokerage

RH: 13 million accounts

Etrade: 5.2 million accounts

Webull: 2 million accounts

IBRK: 700k accounts

Even if only a small portion of users switch brokerages 5-10% we are still looking at 1-2 million new accounts up for grabs between TD/Schwab/Fidelity/Vanguard

More users = more deposits/commission = more profits = stonks go up

**Reputation -** RH/Webull/Etrade/IBRK have had their app ratings and reputation destroyed thanks to reviewing bombing as a result of market collusion. These low reviews will discourage any new retail investors from using their platforms and push them towards TD/Schwab/Fidelity.

**Discount:**

$SCHW is trading at a 17% discount (as of PM on Friday) from its January high all while new retail investors and user registrations and deposits reached an all time high over the past week. Negative media coverage and market sell off this week has caused every publicly traded brokerage company to sell of from their highs. With a market rebound and new user registration data for January this stock will fly past its ATH's and run into the 70's.

**Average Daily Users**

The average daily website users has seen almost a 20% increase from the October 2020 numbers to December 2020 alone. The January numbers will even be substantially higher with TD Ameritrade and Schwab both reporting network strain due to the influx of new investors signing up last week to get into GME/AMC/BB. This trend wont be stopping anytime soon, the retail investor's strength is gaining. Just look at Wallstreetbets alone we had 2.2 million members as of Monday and now we are sitting at 7 million.

**Upcoming Earnings**

$SCHW is going to crush their upcoming earnings for Q1 2021 in April. They acquired TD Ameritrade on October 6. The amount of new retail investors has exploded over the last couple of months. Just look at last years growth in new accounts most brokerages have seen a over 100% increase in 2020 traffic. Their next earnings report for Q1 2021 will be the first quarter with 3 full months of combined revenue from both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab. There will also be a mass exodus of upset traders fleeing Webull, Etrade and Robinhood by the thousands and transferring their assets into TD Ameritrade and Schwab.

**Future/Longevity of Brokerages:**

TD Ameritrade/Schwab will be one of the few brokerages not being slammed by class action lawsuits as a result of the manipulation today. E Trade, RobinHood, IBRK and Webull will have users fleeing in the masses to new brokerages. Do you really want to leave your money sitting on a brokerages that may have pending lawsuits against it and possible liquidity issues? (looking at you Robinhood)

**Price Target:** Bank of America just upgraded $SCHW on January 12 giving it a $68 target. Stating their has been mass growth in retail users. This was prior to the new user explosion the past 2 weeks. This stock will easily run to $70 once data comes out for January 2021 on the amount of new users and transfers.

**TLDR:** $SCHW will crush its Q1 2021 earnings thanks to an explosion in new retail investors as a result of the media coverage on GME and AMC. Retail traders on platforms that halted trading activity on Thursday will also be transferring their holdings to Schwab + TD Ameritrade. $SCHW is at a discount thanks to the market sell off and will rebound to $70+ once registration data comes out for January.

Position: 02/05/2021 & 02/12/2021 $57 Calls

Calls are dirt cheap as this stock is seen as a boomer stock with low volatility.

EDIT: A few people saying TD/Schw/Fidelity were no allowing GME/BB/AMC trading. This may be a result of your cash not settling. New accounts needed their funds to settle before trading these higher volatility tickers. Any errors popping up may also be due to server strain, I was using TD and RBC in Canada and had issues finding tickers/entering into positions

EDIT 2: Schwab will be giving its winter business update on Tuesday at 11am. I expect them to discuss the massive growth in retail investors which should help this stock bounce.

EDIT 3: talked to a online agent about transferring over investments into Schwab. He mentioned that there has been more transfer requests in the last couple days then all of last quarter causing wait times/rep times to go from 5 minutes on hold to over a hour on average."|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|['DD']|[]|['TD', '$SCHW', 'TD', 'GME', 'AMC', 'RH', 'GME', 'BB', 'CEO', 'CNBC', 'GME', 'BB', 'GME', 'TD', 'GME', 'RH', 'IBRK', 'TD', 'I', 'GME', 'AMC', 'BB', 'IBRK', 'IBRK', '$SCHW', 'PM', 'TD', 'BB', '$SCHW', 'TD', 'TD', 'TD', 'TD', 'E', 'IBRK', '$SCHW', '$SCHW', 'GME', 'AMC', 'TD', '$SCHW', 'A', 'AMC', 'I', 'TD', 'RBC', 'EDIT', 'I', 'EDIT']|['SCHW', 'GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'SCHW', 'SCHW', 'SCHW', 'SCHW', 'GME', 'AMC', 'SCHW', 'AMC']

Tendietime, memes, 🚀emojis🤝💎, whatever motivation you think you still need for tomorrow and the days after to just HOLD, **its actually much simpler.**

So mute your evening drawing class for a minute, chew your crayons to help you concentrate and focus on what im telling you.

We know:

**A) Shorts** [**bleed**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9dukq/its_working_melvin_capital_lost_53_in_january/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) **by holding short positions. Shorts desperately want to close positions.**

**B) To close, they have to buy stonks from us;** *saw a post earlier (help me find it?) saying we hold most of the shares.*

**C) If they buy, price goes up because we dictate the ask.**

so by easy, 2 braincell logic, whoever sells first, will automatically be the first to miss out on the tendies that follow.

Now idk about you guys, but my 3 braincells seem to only exist to make me think about what i missed out on,

>""why didnt i buy earlier"", ""why didnt i buy more"", ""why did i not take out a fucking loan"".

Im more okay with holding too long than too short

(fuck short anyways right?)

The essence is: what will you tell your 3 friends when they ask how much you made?

>""yea nah i sold at 600 haha, i know it went to 5000 but you know that old boomer who said you cant time the market haha? now lets go celebrate at wendys i'll let you guys choose anything you want from the dollar menu haha""

Dont be that guy

Now go back drooling at your art teachers cutout, delete your limit orders and when your artificial mistress Alexa wakes you up tomorrow with the generic ""I love you my lovely toilet-tiger"" and your old notification to sell on market open, tell her shes not real and ask if she allows you to stay in bed for 10 more minutes

TL;DR:

As soon as you sell, it drives the price up further because shorts have to cover and buy at our ask, therefore the sooner you sell, the more potential gains you will miss out on.

The board's objective is to make this a long-term win. It is not to either pump the price or burn the shorts. Burning the shorts is fun for them, but not their job. A significant cash infusion via capital raise (around $1 billion or so) would increase their positive outcomes a lot. There are a few ways to do this, but I think the best is a rights dividend/warrant offering where current shareholders get warrants. This would have some unpredictable effects on the stock and possibly cause some unpredictable short-term volatility, but would ultimately reduce volatility a lot..**

*Disclaimer: Not financial/investing/tax advice. I'm not a sell-side expert and don't have investment banking experience, but if any sell-side experts give me commentary on this thread I'll integrate and credit. I probably got some details wrong. I'm short-term bullish on this stock, but have a tiny long-term put position.*

Gamestop as a business would long-term benefit from more cash right now. They have 949m of long-term debt, and a bunch of leases they'd like to cancel (and severance payments they'd have to make with those store closures to laid off employees specific to those stores). They also would like to accelerate their development of more profitable businesses (such as eCommerce, any new ideas, and the rest). Extinguishing this debt completely, ditching bad stores, and investing in growth would all make sense to an extent, even if they turn around and issue new debt (at a much lower interest rate since their financial situation will be improved).

To do this, they need to raise capital. While they could use debt, I don't think that makes sense with equity at these values. Therefore, they will try equity if they do. The three approaches that make some sense (Also the three most frequent approaches) are to do a secondary offering (similar to an IPO, which is a primary offering), do an off-the-shelf offering (which they technically can already do $100m of), or do a rights distribution.

Additionally, GME will want to regain control of their stock. Tilray's founder commented on this recently, but basically, when the stock is like this, there are a lot of side effects  - more legal risks, any options or RSUs you issue employees stop being long-term motivating, a lot of early retirements as people cash out their options, and just a huge amount of press that is unrelated to your business goals. It's not actually good for the business to have a stock this volatile.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/tilray-ceo-brendan-kennedy-issues-a-warning-to-gamestop-amc-bosses.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/tilray-ceo-brendan-kennedy-issues-a-warning-to-gamestop-amc-bosses.html)

Here is some more detail of my non-professional understanding of these fundraising methods. I think a rights distribution is most likely.

**Secondary Listing:**

This would involve them bundling a bunch of institutions and offering new shares out, just like an IPO. The problem is that to do this, they have to offer at a discount. This will enrage current shareholders. This also will allow shorts to cover more or less immediately, which also will enrage the current shareholders. I think this one is bad press all around, and I think they'd have to offer a very large discount to get institutions comfortable with doing it given the daily volatility. They also open themselves up to lawsuits, because the price is very volatile, and if GME is, for example at $100 3 weeks from now, it's an instant lawsuit. by both current and new shareholders because the losses are so large. I think this is their worst option.

**Off The Shelf Listing:**

GME already has a $100m authorization for this. I suspect (but don't know) they already used it I believe there are some timing issues here, but this is the second best option. I think there are some timing delays on being able to use it, and there may still be some legal risks I'm unaware of. Optically, I think it looks not great because it will run contrary to the fervor gripping the stock right now and be seen as giving the shorts a bit of a lifeline.

**Public Rights Distribution:**

A write-up on this in general here:

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rightsoffering.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rightsoffering.asp)

I think this is their best option. In this, they would dividend out warrants to shareholders (this is an option, except you pay the company for the share and they make a new share, instead of someone having to sell you an existing share - so it dilutes. Usually this is done as 1 warrant per X shares. So for example, they might dividend out 1 warrant for every 5 shares held. They could then set a warrant exercise price that is low compared to the current price, but obviously not lawsuit bait, such as $20. Dividending out two warrants per 3 shares long at this price would likely result in full conversion right now, and raise them $1,000,000,000 roughly in cash.  Because these ONLY go to existing shareholders, it ends up not being dilutive in the same way other offerings are - everyone can preserve their share if they put capital in - does not punish longs. **Realistically though, they'll want to issue the fewest warrants possible at the highest price they can justify and avoid danger because the more warrants they issue, the more it increases the value of puts and can create unintended consequences.**

The way this would play out is that they'd first announce the rights distribution, probably a few days to a week before. This will result in some interesting market dynamics that I'll describe in a moment.

Then, you'd get the rights distribution as a GME long. As a GME short, you'd have to SERVE UP THE RIGHTS DISTRIBUTION to the long you borrowed shares from.  Because there are a lot more longs than shares, this would have some chaos, which the market makers would have to sort out.

Then, there would be a short time during which people have to elect to exercise the warrant, which you'd be able to do through your broker They'll want this as short as possible so that the price doesn't fall below the warrant price.

Then, they clear all the warrants, and a day or two later, deliver all the shares to people.

This is their best approach I think because it gets them capital without being pain to existing longs, while also reducing their lawsuit risk compared to the others because they are just distributing a right at a low price to existing longs on equal footing, who are the ones who have standing to sue them in the first place.

I don't know how the laws would work on insiders - I think they can exercise these, but I'm sure there are a lot of details on the timing of it. They probably need to do it well ahead of q4 earnings lockup to be clean.

**Rights Market Dynamics:**

I find this very hard to predict, but this would have a few effects.

1. Upon the warrants/rights being granted (NOT declared), stock will fall in price significantly, but longs shouldn't actually lose money because they also were granted warrants. In theory, warrant value + stock value for a given number of shares (plus their granted warrants) should be the same as the prior stock price. In other words, I don't really see it as bearish or bullish.
2. You would not want to be long call options through this. Very ITM calls and calls that expire before the distribution would be largely and completely unaffected respectively, but OTM longer dated calls would get destroyed the moment this is announced. If you do have an ITM call, you will want to get out of it before the distribution by either exercising to get shares, or selling it. If you sell and are still bullish, you can then go and buy shares. Would not recommend trying to buy OTM calls after this repricing, though I guess you could.
3. Puts are the reverse. Puts that are shorter dated than the distribution don't change. Puts that are longer dated go up in price a lot even though the total value of the company didn't change.
4. You could be short through this, but it's a little annoying. Most likely, you'll be marked short the warrant, so the warrant share structure will kind of mirror the current long structure, but this has to be closed out before the exercise date, so warrants will all get called in at some point. **In a sense, it's forcing shorts to cover a good portion of their short** since the warrant will arbitrage such that the warrants granted + stocks originally held = same value as the stock alone was before. They'd have to get the cash to buy warrants on the market to deliver to people you borrowed from. Likely a bit of a mess. Would cause some short covering, alongside that call selling. Would this be more buying or selling? I don't know, the stock is super levered. I don't think it would matter a lot initially though.
5. After the distribution happens, the stock should reduce volatility after the initial price renormalization of warrants distributed + original stock = same market cap (but stock price down). This will be more the case after shares delivered. The reason the volatility reduces is that this will reduce the leverage in the stock - calls on one side, short on the other. It also eliminates the bankruptcy thesis that shorts were in on in the first place.
6. GME would regain control of their stock and be set up for a faster turn-around.

The only downside of this is it's a bit less intuitive and will require significant explaining to people. But I think it's the most fair to existing shareholders, causes the least legal risk, and puts the company in an excellent position to do their turn-around.

What I'm uncertain on is if there are weird gamma squeeze dynamics from the share price being implied to be lower after a distribution. They may want to distribute more modestly than I'm suggesting for this reason.

**Other Unknowns:**

I don't know what restrictions are on how many warrants they can toss out and if shareholder votes are required. It seems to me it's close to a stock split, so maybe none? Any investment bankers have thoughts on this - minimum price they can offer a warrant if equal distribution to all shareholders? Maximum dilution? In situations where they have to issue warrants at or above current price, this obviously would not work at all. My sense is they can be at a discount, and can dilute, but may have maximums. Anyone able to confirm who is an expert?

**Timing**

My understanding which may be incorrect is they can’t do this before earnings. Their fiscal year I think ends this week? So they’d have to hurry to do this. Would not be surprised at an early earnings in order to facilitate. Early earnings is a tell that capital raise incoming."|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|['GME', 'I']|['GME']|['A', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'IPO', 'GME', 'I', 'IPO', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'I', 'X', 'ONLY', 'GME', 'GME', 'SERVE', 'UP', 'THE', 'IGHTS', 'UTION', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'NOT', 'I', 'ITM', 'OTM', 'ITM', 'OTM', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Yes, it is heavily manipulated. Yes, there is a shortage. Yes, there is a case for the inflation adjusted price being disconnected from current market value.   Yes, it has industrial use. Yes, it's the metal on your wife's bf's cock ring.

You're not wrong, but theres some major issues.

It's a 1.5 Trillion dollar market cap. There is a hard case for the WSB, if acting in collusion which it shouldn't, cause that's naughty, to move silver.

Citadel, et al own a real stake in silver. Maybe deal with one issue at a time.  They would be enriched by this play, which effectively undoes doing them dirty.  Do you really wanna give them a reach around while you're savaging their red little asses?

Think about who owns the physical good.  This would cause physical silver to rocket, enriching some pretty nasty despots (both political and financial). None of this exists in a vacuum.

Every time someone has tried to mess with the silver market at scale it's blown up in their faces. Especially the Hunt brothers (Silver Thursday in 1980).  They literally lost their billion dollar family fortune in the mid 80's (from the stuff stemming from 1980)

Precious metals are a far more liquid market, with far greater trading times, and more world markets effecting price.  This means there are more players.  WSB was the David in the GME story, and won't register on the Silver market. You have COMEX & LBMA.

JPM is one of the big Market Makers.  Citadel et al aren't even a blip compared to JPM.

I'm saying it's not even bringing a knife to a gun fight.  It's bringing a rubber band gun to a nuclear arms meeting.

These MF's are gonna eat all your tendies for an appetizer and want more.

&#x200B;

That said, the existing DD has had very very valid points.  Silver is logically a sound investment, especially after QE Eleventy Billion.  I'm saying bleach your mind of the thought of attempting to impact the silver market.

Let's talk about the theory behind using magic lines; Momentum in stocks can be somewhat predictable, and 'Elliot Wave Theory' depicts just that (Figuring out what a reasonable Price target to set and how long these rallies can push for is more complex and we wont talk about it.) 

Follow along as you look below: Stonks go, ""Up, dip, up, dip, up"" before going ""dump, bump, dump.""

&#x200B;

How do we relate this to GME? Bullishly, I would say we are about to enter the last 'impulse wave' (Top trend line in the picture above,) and that price movement on Monday/Tuesday this week will say a lot about how drastically this squeeze will truly be pushed upwards. (Rising wedge depicted below)

[If there is a dip into the 300-320 range in P-M, I would load there; if below $300 is broken, beware, as it very well may act as a neckline break of a H&S formation.

&#x200B;

Now, I'm not in love with the wave cycle above  and that we appear to be on relative to the Long term stages of this movement to be completely honest, and after including the PM/AH price movements... It appears that on Thursday morning GME had started the first move in it's final impulse wave higher to find the peak; Meaning, the *squeeze was very likely to be squoze* going into into Thursday's Open Market had retail not been almost totally restricted from buying.

 (See chart Below; (5) would've been 'peak' - perhaps around 1k/share.)

[Think of it this way - without restricting buying, retail would've bought the PM\/opening dips like crazy, solidifying the first impulse wave & sending us off into another Gamma Squeeze\/Short-Squeeze combo. This was already AFTER the drop in the general markets on Wednesday, what I suspect to have been a result of big-boys liquidating longs.](https://preview.redd.it/e7ng28xsjpe61.png?width=1518&format=png&auto=webp&s=704cd948d59d85cf149eba94ba49a60f1cfc6c0f)

Finally, a bit of AMC analysis.... Here we see a similar story to GME, appearing to be within a rising wedge, ready to start its next impulse wave upwards. 3-6 mo PT of $28

Many of us are probably watching the short interest % of float to indicate when the short squeeze is squoze. At this point, the hedge funds clearly know this, given how hard they've spent the last couple days using their MSM shills to announce ""WE HAVE EXITED OUR SHORT POSITIONS!!! YOU WIN!""

There is a chance we're going to see that short interest % of float number go down at the same time as the price drops. Failure-to-delivers may also go down, at least in appearance.

# This is probably a lie.

Failure-to-deliver numbers and the short interest % are just the tip of the giant dildo they're trying to fuck us with. If this thing is actually what it looks like, they have way, way, *way* more exposure to this shitstorm than they are letting on.

There are ways for hedge funds and their colluding market makers to hide their exposure to a counterfeit stock scheme / naked short / short attack. You can read all about it here: [counterfeiting stock 2.0](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) (again, credit to johnny for bringing this to our attention)

If you don't know how to read, just scroll down to the picture of the iceberg.

If you **do** know how to read but don't have a lot of time, still scroll down to the picture of the iceberg, and start reading from there.

**TL: DR**\-- using a bag of dirty tricks, hedge funds can ""unwind"" their *disclosed* short positions, without ever having to exit their *real* short positions-- the ones that are actually super dangerous and putting them at risk of insolvency. They are going to do everything they can to get us to sell, **up to and including fucking with the disclosed short interest % of float-- the number we're all watching.**

So watch the short interest with a titanic-sized grain of salt. It could go up, it could go down, but it's likely not anywhere close to their real risk exposure either way.

**EDIT:** if you have a lot of time on your hands and want some more research on how this works and maybe a little peek into what we're in for, see u/Sleavitt10's comment [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9jbc5/listen_to_me_we_cannot_trust_the_short_interest/glib7cs/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

**EDIT 2:** people are pointing out that that source I’m using says short squeezes aren’t really possible anymore, because counterfeiting can overcome any amount of buy-side pressure. And normally I would agree, but there are exceptions.

Like when a counterfeiting scheme runs into a multi-million-man army of enraged retail investors who are willing to buy the stock at any price, for example. And remember, the longer this goes on, the more they lose, so they are highly motivated to produce a quick resolution. The desperate moves on Thursday and Friday that ultimately failed are proof of what a serious situation this is becoming for them.

The sheer number of retail investors who are buying this stock just to fuck up the short attack is absolutely mind boggling. So long as we maintain our numbers and resolve, they must spend more and more money to get out of the hole.

Hold. The. Line.

**EDIT 3:** [IT'S ALREADY FUCKING HAPPENING.](https://twitter.com/jonpeterswrites/status/1356019766624923654) 6 hours ago shorts weren't covering, and suddenly they've covered 30 mil on 50 mil volume?

So far so good.

The problem with SLV is that silver IS NOT A CENTRALIZED MARKET!

The biggest silver market is COMEX, which is a futures market. See, futures markets aren't the same thing as single stock markets, they are much bigger, have more institutions rather than retail investors and they are much more complicated.

When a typical retard buys gme, they hit buy market and that's it, they now have 1 share. 

In futures, it's different. You buy contracts, these contracts are standardized and the most popular contract for silver is : SI . SI has a contract size of 5000 troy ounces!! One contract is equal to  135000 $ worth of silver. You don't need to pay 135k for a contract, you can buy it for 14k if you close the position before you need to take delivery of the silver.

Some of you might have 14k, but the risk is very high: if silver moves down 1 dollar you lose 5k.

Another problem in the silver market are the participants: goverments own silver, hedge funds own silver, investment funds own silver, too many people own too much silver!! Gamestop is at about 30 billion dollars marketcap ( and that's now ). 

The open interest on the latest SI contract is 135 960, giving it an open interest value (which admitedly is not marketcap) of 18.354.600.000 usd. 18 billion usd in just open interest. 

Open interest is how many positions are open at any given time.

Silver is a much bigger market, with more big players.

GME - there weren't so many hedge funds (poor Melvin, that was the one big hedge fund shorting gme) and so it was a subreddit against a fund, and we won.

Silver is a different story - JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi, hedge funds, governments, a lot more money is in silver than gme.

For these reasons, don't go into SLV, you will just play where the big boys want you to play, they have the advantage there.

tl;dr : Silver won't moon, banks have advantage, hold gme to 10k."|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|['SLV']|[]|['SLV', 'IS', 'NOT', 'A', 'LIZED', 'ARKET', 'COMEX', 'SI', 'SI', 'SI', 'GME', 'JP', 'SLV']|['GME']

Before breaking down why this is important, let's quickly recap some of the highlights of last week:

GameStop had one of its first big pops to open the market Wednesday and remained volatile all day. Thursday, it opened with another significant pop, and then HFs employed some perfectly timed and very illegal market manipulation tactics. Some of the largest brokerages with the most retail investors blocked the purchase of GME shares, and only allowed the current investors to sell the stock. HFs coupled this restriction in free trade with what is commonly referred to as a short ladder attack, which is another form of market manipulation to fabricate the illusion that a stock is plummeting. Newly invested retail traders watched this play-out over the course of the day, and with only the option to sell and seeing their initial investment plummet quickly probably sold the shares, freeing them for Hedge Funds to scoop up. 

Friday morning opened with another pop and the SEC issued a statement that they will be closely monitoring the price volatility of certain stocks, which put HFs on notice, and publicly acknowledged that they are paying attention to the situation. Meanwhile, trade across many of the brokerages that had previously blocked their customers from buying reopened the option to buy, but with significant restrictions. 

🖐💎**TL;DR RE: LAST WEEK 💎🖐**

Starting Wednesday, GME opened everyday with a big pop likely due to the fever pitch of news and interest combined with HFs slowly covering their positions. Tomfoolery was rampant as HFs tried to tamp down a potentially imminent squeeze. 

🖐💎**SELL LIMIT ORDERS 💎🖐**

Okay, so why are sell limit orders so important this coming week? Or many of you may even be asking WHAT IS a sell limit order? To borrow a very succinct analogy: if you are an 🦍 holding a 🍌, the sell limit order is the number you tell your brokerage you're willing to sell your 🍌for. This number can be seen by the market, and the HFs can see these numbers, but more importantly, they can see ALL of them. This is key because depending on how long you've been tracking GME on WSB, you have likely seen several comments saying something along the lines of ""$420.69 IS NOT A MEME"" and it has continually increased from 1k, 5k, 10k, etc. Which is where we get to the meat of this post because if everyone sets the sell limit orders to these memeable numbers, the HFs can see these massive clusters of sell orders and WILL buy them, which will trigger massive drops in share price, and in turn likely cause panic selling much like we saw during the short ladder attack on Thursday. So what next?

**I DONT FUCKING KNOW CAUSE I AM NOT OFFERING FINANCIAL ADVICE, ONLY KNOWLEDGE AS UNDERSTOOD BY ME**

But here's the thing: these particular HFs have turned the market into a game, and a very select few badasses noticed this early on, and then started playing. After much due diligence by the thousands of redditors on this sub, more and more people learned the rules, saw an opportunity, and bought shares of GameStop because they like the stock. These HFs are now counting on all of us retail investors, especially those who are playing on hard mode and don't understand the market, to cut and run and give them an out. 

🖐💎**TL;DR💎🖐**

These particular hedge funds have turned the market into a game. They used cheat codes all last week, and are literally banking on newer retail investors who are playing on hard mode to lose and give them an easy out. Educate yourself as much as possible on the rules and make your own personal informed decision on if you want to set sell limit orders and what that number should be. 

Again, this is not financial advice and I truly am a dummy. I've just been lucky enough to use my nephew's iPad to educate myself whenever he gets distracted, which is usually only during lunch time because Patrick loves tendies. And finally:

Nokia is one of the largest telecommunication companies in the world, as well as one of the front running companies for 5G.  Nokia now has a significant hold in all of the world’s early 5G adopters. Including deals with the top four communication service providers in the United States as well as the top three providers in Japan and Korea. Multinational contracts and deals have placed Nokia at the top when it comes to 5G and it will only be getting bigger when 5G is more accessible to people like us. Last week we ran Nokia up to almost 9 dollars before multiple halts stopped all the momentum. Then the trading restrictions on Robinhood and other brokerages hurt the momentum even more. I believe this was to help the hedge funds cover there ass before the inevitable movement up were going to have in the future. With trade restrictions being lifted on most platforms and earnings coming on Thursday we should see a big move up. This is a value company, with huge room for growth. The hedge funds manipulated this hard dropping from 6 to 4.60. We will not let them win and short another great company into the ground. Nokia is one of the most undervalued stocks on the market. The more we go up the more hedge funds will try and short. Buy shares and hold for a long time. This is a great company.

This has escalated faster than my dick when DFV posts, While pretty much everyone who bought into GME sub 20 knew there were massive tendies to be made, not single person in this entire scenario expected it to play out like this.  


Lets take a step back and review the FACTS, amidst the bot attacks, fake news, and overall noise coming from the powers at be.

1. **Gamestops long term prospects look good: marketing, $$$ and more $$$**

fundamentals are what we care about as the business needs to go through a paradigm shift in its model, thankfully, it has. We can all thank new daddy cohen for making this happen by investing in the long term strategy for revamping a business that was on its way out. He involved himself on the board, brought in his former chewy associates, and is making bigly moves to start setting up their pivot. Gamestop would naturally start to increase as speculators saw serious financial backing from an independent investor with an alignment between management and shareholders starting to form. Obviously when board members and c-suits are shareholders they have vested interest in the performance of the company, if you go and [read wikipedia on gme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop) you will see that they did not have any shareholders in upper level management, until 2019 which helped create the situation we are in, if the people running the company do not care about the value of it, they have no concern to prevent the value from being destroyed. So yay, management now gives a fuck. we have our first ingredient, ***aligned $$$***

Now on to the second ingredient, big $$$

Gamestop has to finance its operations for 2019 and 2020 as it went deep into the red, the lack of free cash flow and poor sales prospects drilled their credit rating to emerging market status, and set them up to fail if they could not find profits again, which with shit management is to be expected. With the new interest from stakeholders, GME took off, gaining market cap, and opening up a new avenue of financing. Even if GME hit a modest market cap of lets say 6.5bb, they would have been able to raise money without diluting the float by much. But now with a market cap approaching 20+bb its becoming absurdly easy for them to raise capital, hell even raising a cool billion becomes viable now via a secondary offering.   Gamestop has become a self fulfilling prophecy as of no amount of shorting can sustain a low value for the stock, so they have a solid avenue to raise more cash. Which in turn means they can pay off their debt, increase their credit rating, and what do you know all of the sudden they can become profitable again.   


third ingredient: attention and faith.

self explanatory, the whole hedge fund situation has brought more media attention to gamestop than any other form of marketing, now literally everyone and their mother will know about GME forever and a lot of people who used to engage with the brand are now flocking back. Now combine that with the faith that new daddy cohen has inspired you have a recipe for MASSIVE TENDIES

&#x200B;

now when we combine, aligned monetary interests, with new financing capability, huge investor confidence on management AND brand awareness. well fuck me thats one hell of a grand slam. 

with these few ingredients GME can cook up so many tendies, we already know they are working on making PC gaming more mainstream, and with all the renewed interest they can definitely pivot to some more interesting revenue streams, think the nintendo center in NYC for the heads who know, gamestops could become these social venues where gamers meet up and play together, or maybe hangout and have a beer. adult gaming and entertainment is actually taking off with the millennials and I expected it to be a serious path forward for gamestop. maybe not exactly like a video game bar, but some form of live social-gaming experience is something that I think is highly likely they will integrate. 

2. The financial institutions have their back against the wall, nothing can save them other than a gov bailout, its really a matter of closing the loss on the way down.

There is no fucking way on this planet that these shorters walk away from this in one piece, i do not think they will become insolvent because you know, wall street, but there is no way they do not take heavy losses. The sheer grit from new comers, lurkers, big names, and OGs is unspeakable. people have taken this scenario personally and people are just throwing money at this simply to say, BEARS R FUKT HEDGIES EAT COCK, which is not something this hedge fuckers could have seen coming. They have an innate arrogance that prevents them from considering such things. They know how much money they control, how to influence the right people, and their all homies with the important people so why should they care about the little guy when they can bend us over and fuck us whenever they want? well jokes on them cuz my wife's boyfriend already went to pound town and my ass can handle the pain. And guess what? SO CAN EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS GAME NOW, people are just buying, buying, and then buying some more, no matter the financial hurt, the buy side pressure has not and will not degrade(maybe when we hit 500+ a share since a lot of people might get priced out then) but it is a losing battle for them as every retail buy takes another share off the market. So they are in a pretty pickle. the longer they wait us out, the fewer shares they have to work with. The higher the price the more they bleed, the more they short, the worse it gets. Basically the longer they wait the more fucked they are, so HOLD because they will be trying everything we have seen this past week on us to get us to sell, become distracted, create FUD, prevent us from buying, restrict options, you name it. 

&#x200B;

All we need are these two points and you can start to see how there is literally no way out for these guys, the challenge, the real challenge ( that gives us our diamond hands) is waiting. yes PATIENCE, as buffet has once said, "" The stock market is a device to transfer money from the impatient to the patient"". WE ARE THE PATIENT, WE ARE STRONG TOGETHER, WE ARE THE FUCKING PLAYERS. And the hedgies know it. they are the impatient ones as each day they lose money, and each day they have to ***work*** to remain afloat. Every single person on this sub does not need to do shit other than buy GME when you see it at a price you like and never sell until the shorts have bled all their capital. 

&#x200B;

TLDR; GameStop has all the ingredients to generate, real long term value for their shareholders, be patient. The shorts have already lost, its a matter of how much now, be patient, the hedgies have to work everyday to figure out how to unfuck themselves, while we just has to scroll WSB and find confirmation bias DD like this one. pretty simple, be patient, watch shorts cry, make unlimited tendies. DO NOT LET ANYONE INFLUENCE YOUR DECISION ON WHETHER TO BUY OR SELL GME, MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS AND STAND BY THEM. I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL, THESE ARE MY OPINIONS, NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE

# GameStop Short Nightmare Shows Few Signs of Becoming a Contagion

[GameStop Corp.’s](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GME:US) surge has struck fear into anyone caught on the wrong side of its ascent. But those **bearish positions probably aren’t big enough to lay low the larger universe of investment funds**.

That’s the view of Barclays Plc strategists led by Maneesh Deshpande. By plotting the value of bearish equity bets versus the whole market’s capitalization, they found that short sales have actually dwindled during the past year to the lowest level since at least 2008. Moreover, those **most-heavily shorted companies targeted by day traders this year had bearish wagers amounting to less than 0.001% of the $43 trillion market.**

Whether losses being suffered by hedge funds and other money pools will be large enough to ignite a full-blown contagion was a concern that arose several times during last week’s selling -- the worst in the S&P 500 since October. For now, while Reddit-fueled stock jocks may have drowned out every other narrative, they’re unlikely to completely subsume the bull market.

 “We’re witnessing a nearly unprecedented amount of speculative activity. But on the other hand, **we are talking about a very narrow group of stocks that don’t have an outsize influence**,” said Marshall Front, chief investment officer at Front Barnett Associates. “**The underlying fundamentals of the economy are strong. A very aggressive and accommodative policy by the Federal Reserve is still intact. Together, they help the stock market on the way up**.”

Burned by short sales going against them, hedge funds have yanked money from the market at one of the fastest rates on record. The most-shorted stocks rallied 14% last week as a group, dealing the biggest blow to short sellers since last April, a [Goldman Sachs Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US) basket shows.

While the **S&P 500 dropped more than 3% last week, traders described the broad market as orderly**. To JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s strategists including Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, the retreat is likely a “short-lived technical tumble.” With earnings improving and U.S. consumers strengthening, this pullback is another opportunity to add stocks, particularly those geared toward an economic recovery, the strategists wrote in a Friday note.

 To be sure, day traders are targeting companies favored by bearish investors, trying to spur squeezes. In 2021, the top quintile of the Russell 3000 stocks with the highest short sales as a percentage of their float is up 20%, compared with a loss of 0.8% for the bottom 600, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But those returns are also consistent with a contour that was already taking shape as investor risk appetite increased: gains in companies with shakier finances, which had trailed during 2020’s pandemic market.

“Although the short squeeze started with GME, it appears to be spreading to a wider range of stocks,” Deshpande at Barclays wrote in a note Friday, referring to GameStop’s ticker. “While we expect some more deleveraging, ultimately the scale of the problem appears quite limited.”

By Barclays’s tally, **short sales totaled $800 billion, or roughly 2% of the total market value of American equities, a sign that short sellers have not extended themselves**. The heavily shorted companies -- those with interest making up more than 20% of their share float -- saw $40 billion of their stock sold short, or 5% of the total pool of bearish bets.

“We remain optimistic that it is likely to remain localized,” Deshpande said. “**The bottom line is that while the pain could continue in the short term, the risk of a full-fledged contagion remains low**.”"|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|['SPY', 'CALLS', 'VIX', 'PUTS', 'HOLD']|[]|['GME', 'SPY', 'VIX', 'GME', 'I', 'P', 'A', 'P', 'U', 'S', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME']

This has been posted before but I think it’s VERY important to know, maybe even should be pinned.


We don’t know if/which brokerages will be instituting buy-order restriction’s on GME etc this week.   If anyone who is interested (and can afford to) still wants to buy shares, know that it is still possible to EXERCISE your call options.  By exercising, they are required to give you the 100 shares you bought.

**How does it work?**


ELI5:  each Call contract is for 100 shares at the strike price.  You’d want to purchase deep ITM Calls, with minimal extrinsic value left in the contract.  On Robinhood, this is manifested as the “To Break Even%”, where this number would ideally be 0% for immediate exercise.

https://imgur.com/a/5VGZvxZ

On other brokerages such as ToS displayed in the link as well, you may just have to do some quick maths to figure out the relative costs.


**How do I know if exercising is worth it?**

Immediately Exercising a Call is supposed to be similar to buying 100 shares outright, right?  But since immediate exercise isn’t how options are usually used, there will be some extra costs involved.

Math:

If $GME is at $300, it would cost $30,000 to buy 100 shares at $300 each.  
**100 shares = $30,000**

If we do this via a (theoretical) option:
Lets say GME is at $300 still.  And lets say the $45 strike Call for Feb.5 costs “$285” each.  You’ll pay that $285 to buy the contract.  Now if you want to exercise that contract, you will pay another $45 for each of the 100 shares you’re exercising the right to buy.
In this example, (45+285)*100 = 33,000
**100 shares = $33,000**


*(strike price + contract cost) x 100 = the cost to immediately buy 100 shares via options*



Obviously this isn’t ideal,  but if RobbingHood et. al. continue their restrictions, this will likely be how I will purchase shares of a stock I like.   I would likely be paying an extra premium per share as you saw, *BUT WHO CARES ABOUT PAYING EXTRA IF WE’RE GOING TO THE MOON ANYWAY*


**How do I exercise an option (on RobbingHood??**

On RH there’s a handy little “Exercise” button when you click on your Call.  You’d just click through the screens to do it.  https://imgur.com/a/BGKCnz1



I’m sorry if formatting is bad and the explanation was *quick and dirty* but I have a feeling many of us will be stuck holding and unable to buy shares outright once again.  If you have questions I Will try to answer in the comments, and if anyone has something better to explain then feel free.

Mercury is also the Roman god of financial gain, commerce, luck, trickery and thieves.

Mercury was known to the greeks as hermes.  Hermes Trismagestrus means Hermes thrice great.  If Hermes and Mercury are the same, then Hermes thrice great = Mercury Mercury Mercury = HgHgHg.

Hermes Trismagestrus was thought to have known the three parts of the wisdom of the whole universe - Alchemy, Magic, and Astrology.  Alchemists turn things into gold.  

The number 3 is also symbolic of Abundance, or opportunity.

So either NYSE is saying that there's a lot of opportunity for financial gain, the only question is whether or not it's by buying GME, or milking the retail investors for all they've got.

Hg is also a private equity firm that targets buyouts primarily in Europe and the US.  So maybe they're saying their name 3 times in hopes they show up.

Some of you know I’m a big BB bull on $BB 

I love the stock, I love the company, I love John Chen, but it’s finally clear why BB has been moving the way it has, in tandem with GME 

Prem Watsa is a huge BB investor and owns a large stake 

Guess who Watsa has beef with? Steve Cohen, the guy supporting Melvin in GME, the final boss so to speak of Point72 with deep ties to Citadel  

[Watsa vs Cohen beef](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.theglobeandmail.com/amp/globe-investor/fairfax-e-mails-come-back-to-haunt-a-wall-street-titan/article571008/)

These are billionaires in financial warfare 

Steve Cohen’s tried to kill Watsa’s Fairfax fund. In turn killing Blackberry. Cohen’s group are the hostile players with MASSIVE capital that have been punishing BlackBerry for years 

It’s obvious now why BB SP has been so low in the market. It’s because Steve Cohen has tried to squash it due to his beef with Watsa. Same thing they’ve been doing with GameStop, but BlackBerry is more personal for Cohen 

Don’t believe me? Look at the daily chart for GME and BB 

GME had its first squeeze on Jan 13th, from $20 to $40. 100% gain. This was an astronomical loss for Melvin, who is backed by Cohen 

Guess when Blackberry began its epic run? Check the chart... Jan 14th, MASSIVE green candle 

December 22nd, random and short BB surge out of nowhere, was so random it shocked me as I thought it might even halt for news. The move faded. 

Check GME chart December 22nd, same day GME posted its first big power move from $16 to almost $20. Again Cohen group taking the edge of BB and moving it to GME. Clear as day now. 

This BB surge is Cohen’s group backing off their BB short, pushing the price up, and shoring up enough funds to move to GME which was hemorrhaging HUGE outflows. Retail and momentum exasperated this move in BB

This is so God damn obvious now in hindsight. This is why BB has been moving in tandem with GME 

This movement is not organic, has nothing to do with fundamentals, or even Blackberry itself!

This is a war between Cohen (Point72, Citadel, Melvin) and anonymous long hedge funds + retail. These anonymous long hedge funds are either using retail or are siding with retail. In the end, funds don’t give a shit about anything besides profit. So be careful, they don’t care about sending any message

Investing in BB right now is investing in Cohen losing his shirt in GME

I know I’ll get hated for this but it’s true and needs to be said 

CONSIDER: 

1) Deleverage, get off margin, don’t YOLO
2) Hedge with puts 
3) Scale some out 

You’re investing in between a financial tug of war that runs deep and is directly tied to the outcome of GME. You are not investing in fundamentals of BlackBerry right now! If Cohen uses political leverage which it looks like he has already, stabilizes his position in GME, he will go on the offensive and come back for blood in BB. Just be careful. This is crazy stuff.

Edit: LOL this place has gone wild and become an echo chamber. Fuck it, I hope Cohen gets destroyed and jailed, TO THE FUCKING MOON BOYS!!!! 🚀 🌙"|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|['$BB', 'DATED', 'DD', 'LEASE', 'ERAGE', 'HEDGE', 'TAKE', 'SOME', 'ROFIT', 'EMENT', 'IS', 'NOT', 'GANIC']|[]|['BB', '$BB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'BB', 'GME', 'BB', 'GME', 'SSIVE', 'BB', 'SP', 'GME', 'BB', 'GME', 'SSIVE', 'BB', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'BB', 'GME', 'BB', 'BB', 'GME', 'HUGE', 'BB', 'BB', 'GME', 'BB', 'GME', 'I', 'YOLO', 'GME', 'GME', 'BB', 'LOL', 'I', 'TO', 'THE', 'CKING', 'MOON', 'BOYS']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

If you have EXTRA money and are already hodling GME, or cannot afford GME you should join the BLNK train.**

So let me preface this by saying **BLNK** will not be the next **GME**. There will probably not be another **GME**. For starters it's not going to have an army of kids who used to shop there 15 years ago hyping it, not to mention over 100% short interest and the fact that in the early days it wasn't even 1b dollar market cap.. But it can a squeeze of it's own for it's own reasons entirely and so I have spent time looking beyond just the stock price movements which is what initially led me to start the idea of a **BLNK** DD. I do want to point out some things I noticed while the big squeeze started happening.

* A lot of companies with high short interest such as **IRBT** and **BLNK**, along with those more talked about companies such as **AMC** just started causing the shorts to cover all sorts of positions and move their money around. **BLNK** share price was up to about 65 dollars before falling down to 50 over the past 2 days. It has reached 55 dollars in the past so this wasn't even a squeeze it was just a few shorts deciding to cover their positions most likely because they were getting reamed elsewhere, or just a natural run up because people seem to really like **BLNK** stock. As a matter of fact, they like it so much that it is up *2400%* from 1 year ago. And it's still got relatively small market cap though we aren't in the millions anymore.
* If **BLNK** were to actually squeeze as hard as some of these other companies  have been and somehow reach **GME**'s current 20b dollar market cap it's share price would be $500 dollars. There are plenty of companies with 20 billion dollar market cap. If it just pulled an **AMC** and only jumped 200% in a day it would still be at 150 dollars. Of course if you believed **GME** squeezed already you're obviously mistaken yourself, but the sentence still applies that **BLNK** 10x would still leave it at only 20b market cap.

Is this realistic? Lets take a look at the ways in which **BLNK** is SETTING ITSELF UP to make money in the future, and I say that because as we go into details later you will realized they are currently not exactly succeeding financially, though when has that stopped a company from turning into a success in the past? We will also take a little bit of look at the short interest. Also, these are the kinds of companies who continue to gain more short interest as the price continues to rise.

Okay so **BLNK** is not some new company who just started because of the EV hype, **BLNK** has been a public company since only 2018 but has been a private company since 2008. They had a different name, but merged and acquired a few companies or something, and somehow ended up with the name **BLNK**. Many companies fight for years to break out of the depths of nothingness into a sound business model. According to their CEO: They design, manufacture, maintain, own, and operate charging stations. Their main business goal is to be the owner and operator, so they can be the fuel of the future. They put their focus on areas where you have no other choice but to use public charging.

**BLNK revenue comes from a few different things:**

* **Selling charging equipment:** They sell to third parties Okay, this is not great, but when you add the fact that they are **VERTICALLY INTEGRATED** it really changes the narrative a bit. **AAPL** just decided to go vertically integrated by designing building their own chips for their products, when you design your product and control the supply chain you can make greater strides to improving your margins and expanding your business through natural growth.
* **Utilization**: from people utilizing their charging stations, this is standard and easy to understand. They apparently pay about .12 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity and charge about .39 cents per kilowatt hour. These are pretty good margins and once more than 50% of the cars are the road become EVs this is going to grow exponentially. This will obviously take time but might not be as far away as people are trying to say either.
* **Network of charging stations:**  **BLNK** has it's own cloud based network which will collected *recurring* fees every month. It will also need to be managed, which is also recurring fees. This is also where shit gets interesting because they can use data integration of the network on top of utilization. Of course utilization is going to cost people money but what do we know about companies abilities to collect and sell data in the **AGE OF DATA**? We know that **DATA** is the next oil, that's something we do know, how long and how far will people go to learn your every move, where you charge your car, what stores you're nearby, for how long, etc. This data is will be worth money in time. (side note: **PLTR** LEAPS AFTER THE LOCKUP TARDS)

**BLNK Expansion, Growth, Partnerships, Deals, Future revenue streams**

* **BLNK** recently acquired BlueLA, an EV carsharing company. This was a big move for a little company with negative earnings and cash flow, the fact that they are acquiring things leads me to believe they are actively trying to expand, and beyond just chargers as well. They seem committed to take on the EV industry without being a car manufacturer.
* **BLNK** inked a deal with Cushman and Wakefield, for those of you who do not know they are a global commercial real estate services firm.
* International expansion. **BLNK** has a deal in Greece with **Nissan** to provide chargers to anyone who buys an electric **Nissan**. These people will get access to all of **BLNK**'s network. Let me inform you simpletons who have never left your moms basement, in other countries they are taking the whole EV movement more serious than America has been for some time, with certain countries already having pledged to ban gas powered cars by certain dates. I know the USA is making strides too and not to mention we have Elon but even if penetration is slow here it will not be slow internationally.
* **BLNK** announced on Dec. 15th it was signing an *exclusive* deal with Blessing Health System.
* When **BLNK** signs these types of exclusive deals it often times has contracts for 5-15 years to be the sole provider of charging within the property, this includes charging of all types of equipment not only electric cars.
* **BLNK** received a grant aimed at facilitating the deployment of 200 Blink Fast Level 2 - 19.2 kW charging stations across the mid-Atlantic region, including locations in Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia and Washington, DC. I smell more grants with incoming administration.
*  On 28th of July, **BLNK** and **ENS** entered an agreement  to jointly develop high-power wireless and enhanced DC (direct current for you actual retards) fast charging (DCFC) systems with integrated battery storage for the transportation market. This shows they are looking ahead and willing to work with whoever they need to stay on top of the technology. The resulting DCFC charging solution with high power energy storage will purportedly feature a modular design, and a power output from 100-500 kW. Supposedly it is going to be “economically priced”. They are going to look like the concrete parking guard things we see all over the place and they will be able to wireless charge certain vehicles is the idea.
* On the topic of DC chargers (non wireless). **TSLA** uses this same tech for it's superchargers. What else are DC chargers going to allow in the future? Bi directional charging! With bi-directional charging you can go Vehicle to Grid or Vehicle to Home . This means cars can one day be used to help balance energy needs by allowing EVs to charge during off peak hours and give back during peak hours. This is futuristic shit. Lots of stuff to be excited about. If you are confused and don't care about the future, all you need to know today is that direct current chargers have the converter in the charger itself, so they are bigger and faster at charging cars than the AC converters which have to have an onboard converter which converts AC into DC to feed the battery.  It is also going to lead to people to wanting and needing more advanced charging solutions in their home rather than using the ""well I can just charge over night"" logic with a slow level 1 charger. Having the charger do the conversion is the way of the future. This is the way.
* **VERTICAL INTEGRATION**. Did I fucking mention they are a vertically integrated charging company? This is huge. This needs reiteration. This means they design their own product plus build their own infrastructure out, not to mention provide own their own network, technicians, everything. It is very ambitious and nobody knows how far **BLNK** can take their business yet, but what we do know is that EVs are the future and it is still only the beginning of the EV revolution. Advantages of Vertical Integration include lower costs, faster getting products to consumers, less supply disruption or them raising the price on the company, less transportation costs and reduced delivery turnaround times, improved sales and profitability. I really think this is big to the companies growth trajectory yet it is not widely available information about the company.

**Some Other Points to Consider**

* Supposedly **BLNK** has the only 80 amp level 2 charging station currently on the market. Why does this matter to the small brained? That means it's faster than other chargers you say? Sure, that could be technically true, if that's what it was used for. Then why does it matter? Because **BLNK** chargers have **load-sharing capabilities**. The **BLNK** IQ 200 has the ability to load-share between 2 and 20 units from a single 100 amp feed. This is going to be a game changer for apartments, hospitals, any MUD's, honestly any commercial space that has access to a hundred amp feed. They will be able to service many cars with that single feed. But it gets better, the IQ 200 can intelligently share power, and even queue up cars that are plugged in but not charging, so that they can charge once other cars finish charging. **BLNK** envisions higher output being necessary to facilitate larger companies electric fleets, which we can now see happening in the EV space with trucks and couriers looking to go electric. 
* **BLNK**'s pricing scheme seems to be superior to that of **Chargepoint**. For those of you who do not know **Chargepoint** is another EV charging company, who was recently acquired by **SBE** and they are voting in February to finalize everything I believe. With **Chargepoint** they just sell the chargers to apartments and such and let them determine the pricing. They only manage the network. This means if you have to fill your battery up you have to constantly double check prices to see if you are getting reamed from one of their chargers vs another one. On **BLNK**'s network they will charge the same price everywhere. This is a huge plus in my eyes. I am a little unclear which policy would be in effect for chargers that **BLNK** does not have on it's network, because as I've said it does sell equipment as well.
* **BLNK** has mobile chargers with the same power as their IQ 200 but in a mobile factor in case you run out of fuel on the road.
* **BLNK** does not give a shit to what kind of car you drive, it wasn't to fuel all electric vehicles of the future.
* Fleets are coming, **BLNK** seems ready for this.
* **BLNK** can have partnerships with and target the following sectors which we already see some starting to play out: Parking & Services, Commercial & Residential, Workplace, Healthcare, Education, Retail, Hospitality/Food & Beverage, Entertainment, Governmental.
* Consumer stores that add EV charging stations tend to see costumers staying in their stores longer according to data which I have not seen. This reiterates the point about being able to collect money from data.
* So you may or may not know that in the USA **TSLA** still owns about 80% market share of EVs. We also know this will not last forever as every car company and their mother's boyfriend on top of car companies we've never even heard of are all on the EV bandwagon right now. This is going to make a lot of cars that need charging stations and it will be impossible for any one company to win this battle we can safely assume there will be 2-4 major players.
* Low estimates are expecting the amount of charging stations in America to jump from between a quarter and a half million now, depending on if you are counting Gen 1, to low estimates stating there will be between 13 and 14 million charging stations over the next 7 or 8 years.

**The Possible Concerns that keep getting thrown around**

* **BLNK** seems to be issuing more public shares from time to time (yes, dilution) but we know that when a company is trying to raise capital to expand this is a common strategy, and I don't really think is something to be worried about as long as you believe EV's are really going to be the future. I do.
* **BLNK**'s owner and CEO Michael D Farkas sold shares last month, to the tune of 22 million dollars worth. This always makes companies look bad but many people who own and operate a business would scrape some off the top to support their family in case things don't go according to plan, not everyone is an Elon (and Elon was still set before **TSLA** lets be real), doesn't mean he is necessarily up to no good. Not to mention if shorts were attacking you with even shorter shorts every day would it not worry you a bit that they win? This is an ongoing battle for small companies that don't get along with Wall Street. Plus, he still has 6.7 million shares, he only sold about 540,000 for 22 million dollars. This is a drop in the bucket and the man should not be faulted for this, my opinion is that it is no warning sign.
* This might end up being a competitive space that could lower margins and cause financial hardships for the company. This is an actual concern. It could also take a lot longer than people are expecting to achieve meaningful penetration fully electric cars. I do think **BLNK** being poised to expand internationally will help them offset some of this.
* EV is just a bubble blah blah blah blah okay then don't buy any EV stocks, you might be right but you're also a little bitch.

**BACK TO SHORT SHORTS**

&#x200B;

So if the last data I see on yahoo says that that the float is around 27 or 28 million. This is what's not held by insiders, who are unlikely to sell right now due to the fact that everyone knows we are collectively fucking over people who traditionally fuck them over. If a few weeks ago there was 8.8 million shares shorted and the average daily trading volume as of last week close was 14,263,640. This would make it a modest  .61 days to cover. While it's no **GME**, I do believe this is a pretty large short ratio. Especially when you consider how small the public float is. I do believe this situation will be amplified the further **BLNK** moves away from it's ""valuation."" Also with what we've seen this week these people are willing to double down on things because apparently maybe they are just as retarded as we are. 

So **BLNK**'s short interest is increasing at a rate of about 20% per every 20 dollars the stock rises. This is only a simple estimate based off of quick calculations but you can see that Dec. 15 the stock price was 28 dollars and amount of shares shorted was 6.18 million. On Jan 15th  the share price was $47 and the total amount of shares sold short were 8.8 million. That's about 23%. As of right now it's still less than a day to cover but that does not mean we can't see things get frothy from this point on. Most people think **BLNK**'s chance of success sit somewhere around the 0-3% mark I'd estimate based on the general sentiment not only here on WSB but also anywhere else on the internet you look. The consensus seems to be to stay away from it.

Months back some shady research company probably wrote a hit piece on **BLNK** causing it's share price to tank nearly 50%, it had no real substance, none of the claims were found to have any evidence of being true and it is being investigated by the SEC and such, This same company ran an inaccurate hit piece on **CLSK** some time ago. Culper Research is the name if you'd like to look it up and read the hit piece. **BLNK** managed to defeat the shorts that time but will they again? 

Did I mention who else hates **BLNK** charging? **SHITRON** himself. Here's a quote from the shitman himself back in November:

Shitron said, ""**BLNK**’s valuation makes no sense"" and called the company a “total scheme.” Left said it is “insulting” to call **BLNK** an EV stock.

“New most ridiculous EV stock is $**BLNK**. No $$ for R&D, management accused of securities fraud, no real revenues,” Shitron tweeted.

This goes without saying but every word that comes out of that mans mouth is horse shit. You know this. At this point, literally the whole world knows this. It's not even a question of does he write things based off of any evidence, we all know he would only say negative things that are to cause companies to go down because he has a position shorting them. Does he still have a position? Who knows, but we can safely assume at least at one point he did.

**I try not to use the** ***F*** **word but here goes a bit of simple** ***Fundamentals*** **for you tards:**

Current market cap: **1.85b** Don't need to remind you guys this is still tiny and can still go through some explosive growth at a market cap this small in todays world with the amount of retail investors that throw their money at the most retarded shit you could ever possibly think of, for reference look at **NKLA**. Pretty sure **NKLA** reached a 20b dollar market cap at one point.

**BLNK** has negative earnings per share, and although their revenue is increasing a good amount from quarter to quarter and beating expectations they only earned about 2.26 million last quarter. 

Last quarter GAAP EPS: -.12

Operating Income: -3.50 M

Profit margin: -285.81% 

Return on Equity: -97.33% This tells you how well they are spending their money. 

Yes those are negatives. Impressive, to say the least.

As a matter of fact just about everything you read about this company screams ""***SHORT ME!***"" Think about how many rich powerful scumbags are trying to run this company into the ground. Are they right? Or is EV charging just the future that has not come yet!? What I take from this is that they are spending every dollar they have trying to make it. This is all or nothing for this company. 

**Final Thoughts**

Can we think of any other companies with negative earnings per share that still ended up being great success stories? It's almost like that hasn't been the blueprint for the past 10 years now.. Will it work? Only time will tell. But it definitely will not if these short sellers have their way with it. Also for reference just look at **QS**'s 16b dollar market cap and they don't even have a product. **BLNK** at least has products that are currently going out into the world to be used. Of course the real move could just be puts on **QS,** but I stay out of bear territory especially during bull feeding frenzies. My outlook is that Billions are just the Millions of some years ago, especially when we're printing Trillions out of thin air (Obligatory shout out to the printer man himself **JPOW**). Just remember that we live in a brave new world where kids with phone apps can invest in what they believe the future is going to look like.

Lastly, this is a stock no one has restricted trading to yet, allowing people to buy more than 2-3 shares could seriously cause **BLNK** to quadruple in value. We've seen how fast small market cap companies can jump when millions of autists all buy shares at the same time. Strength in numbers. The revolution of the retail investor has only begun my friends.

Remember I'm just a retard not a financial advisor so this is not advice or anything but I'll let my positions speak for themselves:

**GME** 500 c jan 29 (RIP I TRIED TO IGNITE THE INFINITE GAMMA SQUEEZE GUYS, I DID MY PART AND BOUGHT THAT SHIT ON THURSDAY, GUESSING IF 500C WENT IN THE MONEY IT WAS GOING TO IGNITE A DOMINO EFFECT, I TRIED AND FAILED BUT I LOVE YOU ALL, BUYING MORE SHARES ON MONDAY)

TLDR: **BLNK** is the only vertically integrated EV charging company, **BLNK** has international presence, **BLNK** shares are up 2400% in the past year. It will take .61 days to cover and this number DEFINITELY rising, very small amount of float available, Shitron hates **BLNK**, so do all other short sellers, make no mistake they have put the hit out on **BLNK** and would love to see it run into the ground, **BLNK** is small enough to still rocketship pretty hard, **GME** to the moon."|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|['BLNK', 'DD']|[]|['I', 'EXTRA', 'GME', 'GME', 'BLNK', 'I', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'TTING', 'TSELF', 'UP', 'I', 'EV', 'BLNK', 'CALLY', 'AGE', 'OF', 'LEAPS', 'AFTER', 'THE', 'OCKUP', 'BLNK', 'LA', 'EV', 'EV', 'EV', 'I', 'USA', 'W', 'DC', 'I', 'DC', 'DCFC', 'W', 'DC', 'DC', 'AC', 'AC', 'DC', 'I', 'TICAL', 'I', 'EV', 'I', 'IQ', 'IQ', 'EV', 'EV', 'I', 'I', 'IQ', 'EV', 'I', 'USA', 'EV', 'I', 'I', 'CEO', 'D', 'I', 'EV', 'EV', 'BACK', 'TO', 'SHORT', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'WSB', 'SEC', 'I', 'EV', 'EV', 'D', 'I', 'GAAP', 'M', 'SHORT', 'ME', 'EV', 'I', 'QS', 'I', 'RIP', 'I', 'TRIED', 'TO', 'GNITE', 'THE', 'INITE', 'GAMMA', 'UEEZE', 'GUYS', 'I', 'DID', 'MY', 'PART', 'AND', 'OUGHT', 'THAT', 'SHIT', 'ON', 'RSDAY', 'SSING', 'IF', 'C', 'WENT', 'IN', 'THE', 'MONEY', 'IT', 'WAS', 'GOING', 'TO', 'GNITE', 'A', 'OMINO', 'FFECT', 'I', 'TRIED', 'AND', 'AILED', 'BUT', 'I', 'LOVE', 'YOU', 'ALL', 'UYING', 'MORE', 'HARES', 'ON', 'EV', 'ITELY']|['GME', 'GME']

If you are absolutely  new to stocks and options, you should start with likes of Investopedia  to learn basic mechanics and greeks. This post will focus on a little  less obvious things.

**1) I sold options and they became In the money. When will I get assigned?**

Technically,  you can get assigned at any moment since you’ve sold it. But if there  is any extrinsic value of an option contract (if your option is trading  higher than the difference between the strike price and the current  market price of a stock) it will almost never be exercised before  expiry. Watch out for these two events, though: hostile takeovers and  dividend trigger (if the dividend payed is higher than extrinsic value).  Well, also watch out for drunk idiots who exercise by mistake.

**2) It’s expiry day. At what time will I get assigned?**

Most  often Option Clearing Corporation will trigger automatic assignment of  any ITM options, unless other is configured by the client in his  brokerage. The default automatic exercises and assignments processing  time is 16:00 pm Eastern Time. However, the OCC permits client manual  exercise decisions for until 17:30 EST.

**3) At 16:00 my sold options have expired worthless. Am I good?**

No,  as mentioned above – if the price in after hours moves and makes your  options ITM, they can still be assigned until 17:30. Especially be  cautious in the days of earnings or days when 13F are published —  those  can move asset prices after hours quite a bit.

**4) Can I buy or sell options before/after hours?**

No,  generally you can’t. The exceptions are very select instruments. Also,  some brokers offer exclusive packages and allow you to trade options  outside regular hours, but you will be, basically, trading with the  broker himself.

**5) How options and stocks are taxed if I exercise or get assigned?**

Options  premiums are added or subtracted to/from the base price of the stock.  Say, you bought calls strike price 100, for 10$ premium. On the day of  expiry the price of your stock has gone up to 200, Your calls are now  worth 100$, but you still believe that the stock price can go even  higher, you would prefer to own and hold that stock. You can sell those  call contracts and be taxed for profits of 90$ per contract. But if you  exercise your contracts, your base price will be 110$ per contract and  your profit will be your future sale price minus 110$. Works in a  similar way with puts, and short positions in options.

*Disclaimer*: this might not be accurate for all jurisdictions and accounts. This is not an accounting advise, please contact professionals!

**6) Why my options are losing value even though the underlying stock went in my direction (up for calls, down for puts)?**

Options  prices are more complex than simply tracking the performance of a  stock. Again, it is useful to learn the greeks. But to start, you should  understand two most useful aspects: time decay and Implied Volatility.  If you have short term expiring Out of the money options, their price  will decline even if the price of a stock goes in your direction, but  not fast enough.

Implied  Volatility can be described as market sentiment and expectancy of price  changes. The higher is the belief that the price will change – the more  expensive are the options (especially with low delta). For example, If  you bought calls after 3 days of insane volatility, but then the next  weeks it moved up for only 1 or 2%, your calls will likely not gain, but  rather lose value, because you bough them at the peak of IV, and since  the volatility seemingly settled down, the market no longer expects huge  moves and is no longer eager to pay big premium for your options.

There  can be also so-called unusual activity. That’s basically large amounts  of purchases of some particular options outstanding against the general  flow. Those events can change premiums for a period of time too and  often indicate a start of a new trend.

**7) Can I do a Poor Man Covered Call on a cash account?**

Poor  Man Covered Call is a strategy of selling OTM calls but having a deep  ITM call as a hedge. It imitates covered calls strategy. Some people  assume, that since this strategy caps your downside risk, this will be  allowed on a cash account. This is false. Cash accounts allow no naked  options selling, even if your max loss is caped.

**8) What is Settled cash and Free Riding Rule?**

Most  trades have settling periods. For stocks it is T+2 (the day you traded +  2 business days) and for most options it’s the next day. This means,  that if you sold something, the cash is not immediately delivered to  your account. Brokers will still allow you to buy with unsettled cash.  This is called Free Riding. But if you sell anything you bought with  unsettled cash — they will give you a 90 days restriction for violation  of Free Riding Rule. This is very uncomfortable.

This applies only to cash accounts.

**9) If I added to a position under Free Riding Rule, can I still sell if I’m within limits of what I bought before?**

No.  For example, if you had 100 shares for a long time, but bought 10 more  shares under Free Riding, even if you then sell only 1 share before cash  is settled, you will still get a 90 day restriction. At least on most  brokers that I know.

**10) Can I sell covered calls when I have 0$ settled cash on cash account?**

Not  on all brokers. Some brokers will treat selling covered calls as if you  are using formal 0% margin. And since you have 0$ settled cash, your  cash doesn’t exceed your 0% margin. Sounds moronic, but that’s how it  works. You might be caught in this situation if you are rolling covered  calls on a cash account: you buyback those contracts, get bellow your  settled cash and then can’t sell new covered calls until next business  day.

**11) How to save on commissions if I’m not using a commission-free broker?**

Some  brokers allow you to configure your orders with numerous options. First  of all, don’t use their smart algorithms or any kinds of quirky  ‘special sauces’ - 9 times out of 10 you will get both worse execution  and bigger commissions. Secondly, if configurable, always ask for an  All-or-None orders.  This will ensure that your order will be much more  likely filled from one source and on one exchange, thus minimizing your  commission. Finally, there are exchanges that offer traders rebates for  added liquidity. For example NYSE Arca (PSE) and BATS offer rebates to  customers for added liquidity in options trading. Yes, you will get a  cashback for your trades. Configure destination of your orders to select  those exchanges. Note: some brokers will provide those rebates to their  users and some will just take it themselves. Note 2: rebates are  offered for adding liquidity; for removing liquidity you will still get  charged.

Hope this helps! Feel free to write your questions if you have some.

I've been doing a lot of research and thinking today about where we're at right now and where do we go from here and I wanted to get it all written out for my own sake but I also might as well share with you guys.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Let me start off by saying that I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I an expert but I do follow the markets closely and I do listen to the experts.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I believe that due to a number of factors that I will outline in this post that we could see a liquidity crisis in the next 1-4 weeks. Now before you start calling me a gay bear please hear me out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As you retards have been yolo'ing FD's this has gamma squoze the shit out of the market. This is great until the market rolls over and the same dynamic goes against you. When prices go down, the MM's sell the shares they were using as a delta hedge and that makes prices go down faster.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What happened this week with RH and others halting trading on the meme names was a liquidity issue. RH drew down their $500M credit line and borrowed another $1B last week to try and keep up with you guys! Massive call buying causes the VIX to go up. VIX going up means the hedge funds, clearing houses and brokerage firms aren't allowed to operate on as much leverage. Low VIX = Leverage good, High Vix = Leverage Bad. If the VIX stays up all of these entities are going to have to sell off their positions to meet their collateral requirements. GME has more shares short than actually exist so if enough autist hold then they will never be able to fully cover. What happens then?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

High VIX means everybody needs to deleverage their positions which means stonks go down :(

There is a pending liquidity problem here. If you look at the chart of GDX for example you will see it always seems to diverge downward from SPY whenever there is a pending liquidity event. In general you would expect to see the TLT go up when the VIX goes up. More volatility means you want to flee to the safety of bonds right? Instead what we're seeing is TLT down while VIX is up. It's my view that TLT will come up and join the VIX very shortly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now I'd like to point out that I'm not a gay bear, I'm a bull at heart. The thing is that if we can be prepared for the crash that's coming we can BTFD so hard. If we have nothing at the bottom then there is no money to BTFD!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

On Friday we saw stocks sell off to their weekly lows,  the VIX was quite high and bond yields were at their all time low. Low bond yields means people are not hedging their portfolios and / or they're selling bonds to cover their margin requirements. The hedge funds are now concerned that if the market continues to go down they will need to start to deleverage. There is more margin and call options out there right now than there has ever been. This is where that reverse gamma squeeze screws you over. This could cause a fast, sharp move lower. Think March 2020.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In the treasury market last week the short term treasury yields fell to all time lows. Short interest for everyday stocks are at alltime lows. Put option volumes are at all time lows. As prices start going down, market participants realize they need to hedge their bets and so they buy puts. MM's short the stock in order to hedge their put sale and this is where the gamma squeeze to the downside exacerbates the move downward.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even mutual funds are record long equity and record underweight bonds. As the market rolls over they will also need to sell equities to get into fixed income.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If you look at the SPY yearly chart there is bearish divergence over the past 2 months. What does that mean? RSI has been trending downwards will price has been continuing upwards. This is an indicator of a market trend reversal. The DMARK is also hitting daily, weekly, monthly and yearly high. This is very bearish as well. These signals don't necessarily mean that something that will for sure happen but it is pointing out that there is tons of risk in the system.

&#x200B;

Now look at the Covid situation throughout the world. It is calming down somewhat but the problem is we're seeing new fast spreading strains of the virus that could easily turn the situation for the worse very quickly. This could lead to more shut downs which effects the economy and the market. So this begs the question, are all of these companies optimistic reflation projections realistic? What happens if / when they miss earning estimates?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So what do we do about this? First and foremost HOLD YOUR GME, AMC + BB shares. They might be the only stonks that goes up this week / month. Assuming you're not all in on GME, what do you do with your other money? Spy puts, TLT calls and Gold are where you want to be if you buy my idea that this could be March 2020 all over again.  I know these are all gay bear moves. Feel free to disagree with me in the comments!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Be careful out there guys!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** The market looks quite risky right now for a number of reasons. Could potentially be like last March. Hold your GME shares, hedge the crash with everything else.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Positions: GME Shares + SLV Calls + Cash, buying TLT Calls and Spy puts tomorrow.

This report will discuss the current and future state of Blackberry Ltd (“**Blackberry**”) and its business viability. Too long has the cycle of research been held in the hands of big banks that are incentivized to publish aggressive price targets at the point of a transaction. Too long have buy-side institutions been caged inside an investment parameter that is geared towards accumulating capital than growing it.

We will be discussing Blackberry’s product suite and its defensibility in their respective ecosystems, what value Blackberry brings to the world and various valuation metrics to justify a price target of over CAD$100.

The Blackberry product suite is largely deployed in hi-tech environments with sophisticated buyers seeking the highest security uncompromising in the sight of an indelicate user interface. This includes both its cybersecurity and QNX platforms.

QNX is vital to the self-driving ecosystem and will be the de-facto operating system at the point of multiple catalysts. This includes the first approved autopilot system in any jurisdiction, the first cybersecurity attack on a connected vehicle non QNX related and diamond handed people in WSB.

**ALL WE NEEDED TO KEEP TRADING WAS AN INFUSION OF $7.5B!!!!!!!**

But, u/clash_jeremy, that's so much money! NO IT ISN'T. The US Government ran a deficit of **$3.1T** last year to keep the whole system going. The Fed added close to **$3T** to their asset sheets to keep the whole system going. So, when it came time to keep the system going for the retail investor, **THEY LOOKED THE OTHER WAY!!!!!**

One of the main duties of the Fed and Treasury is to ensure liquidity in all markets. THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT WE NEEDED WEDNESDAY-FRIDAY of last week.

But, what if they didn't know this was coming. Yeah, convenient alibi if the CEO for DTCC wasn't literally an advisor for the Federal Reserve and the FDIC!

 If anyone knew the nonsense that was going to go down, it was this dude, and he has every obligation to alert the powers that be that there needs to be some sort of intervention to keep the game going. Nobody did anything, because if they allowed us to keep playing the game as normal last week, the hedgies would have been entirely obliterated.

**TLDR = HOLD GME for as long as you can this DD is for AFTER the squeeze, once out get your money into PUTS.**

I wanted to bring you some DD that I have been working on but first let me get something out of the way.  I am tired of all the stock talk and we need to get back to some old school DD so we know where to YOLO our GME returns AND talk about options again.  I do not recommend getting out GME for any reason for the below.  This is what I think is occurring now and over the next few months, or faster, pending the severity of the situation.  If the situation is as severe as u/johnnydaggers & u/vinlo make it look then this could happen A LOT faster.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀GME TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

The unfortunate part is I am a bull by nature, always have been.  This write-up is extremely bearish in nature but before calling me a 🏳️‍🌈🐻it is only because of the unique situation us glorious folk has put us in with uncovering a massive issue with the market.

What is going on now is starting to look a lot like 2008/09.  I believe that the HF's got caught so bad with their naked short selling that there is literally no way to unwind the damage that they are doing.  For some reference PLEASE read this post as I believe this is the catalyst to what I am posting below.  I was missing a piece but tonight I believe I found it:

[u/johnnydaggers & u/vinlo naked short selling write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9jbc5/listen_to_me_we_cannot_trust_the_short_interest/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I started looking at the 08/09 housing crash and then it hit me that the VW squeeze was also occurring around this time.  So what I wanted to see was how much liquidity came out of the market between the squeeze and the housing crisis.  **Can you believe the VW squeeze dropped the market more than the housing crisis?**  The below SPY chart goes from 7/1/2008 to somewhere mid-April.

* You can see that just after the squeeze started the entire market started to dump.  This most likely had to with liquidity and all the same issues we are seeing now
* The VW squeeze dropped the SPY 37% in about 6 weeks
* There was then a 26% rebound during the **peak** of the short squeeze - This tells me the people that were screwed in this one were consolidating liquidity and once they had an idea of what was going on moved into buying calls prior to shorting the market and exacerbating the housing collapse.
* The entire market was still trending down after this rebound until the lowest of lows of the housing market crash

Here is what piqued my interest.  The VW squeeze dropped the SPY **37%** from beginning to end, and the entire housing crisis dropped SPY **28%**?  **HOW IS THIS EVEN REMOTELY POSSIBLE?**

[I eat chalk, not crayons, they taste better.](https://preview.redd.it/4gzqdeml6re61.png?width=1478&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf799e7b86ec26b0b6afcefdf241cb1b48131306)

So I take this info and now look at the current SPY chart and see what GME is doing to the overall market.  This is where we are now:

If we apply some basic math the correct on the market could be somewhere in the 240s.  Yes, I know how crazy that sounds but I believe this to be the beginning of the bubble popping.  We exposed a HUGE crack in the foundation and I think it is only going to get worse especially if any of the additional data provided above is accurate.  If it is then we could be looking at a correction closer to the 45% overall range in the next 6-9 months.

My plays:

GME TO THE MOON - Mix of options and shares and riding this into VALHALLA

As for the bullshit above I am going to be going with:

315P (4-6 Weeks out)

200/250p range or both EOY

I am not a financial advisor, I don't know anything about anything.  I like stonks like GME and this is my very biased mostly retarded fully autistic opinion.

I have been around WSB for years under this username and my other, less anonymous one. Check my other posts to confirm I am not hedgie agent scum.

Now, to the unpopular part: a word of caution. I see a lot of DD around here analyzing the short interest, the $GME public float, and theories about what that means for the trading price of the stock. Yes, we like the stock. HOWEVER, all of this DD fails to consider one very important variable – the authorized but unissued shares of $GME.

If you look at $GME’s articles of incorporation (this is the document that gives a company its corporate existence and, among other things, states the number of shares the company is authorized to issue), you will see that $GME is authorized to issue up to 300,000,000 shares. Currently it looks like there are about 70,000,000 shares outstanding depending on whose number you go with. So, theoretically, the board of directors of $GME could issue three times the number of shares that are currently outstanding today.

Is the board going to do that? Your guess is as good as mine. On one hand, the board is certainly not going to go out of their way to help out a bunch of hedge funds that were trying to total screw them over and drive them into the ground. But on the other hand, the board has a fiduciary obligation to act in the best interests of the shareholders of the company. If they can raise a bunch of money selling stock at a $300+ price level, they have to legally consider it. This could significantly improve their balance sheet by allowing them to take out debt with the cash proceeds from a very rich equity sale.

So, could they easily issue more shares? The answer is yes. In December, the company filed an automatic shelf registration statement. This allows them to, essentially at any time and very quickly register a follow-on public equity sale. You can bet your ass that these shorts have been making calls into the company to see what the appetite would be in taking this route, which could allow them to get out of their positions for substantially less than would be the case if they had to cover in the secondary market (because, diamond hands, of course).

Now a couple of good things, even if the board wanted to do this, it seems very risky for all concerned. I think we all know that after the squeeze is done, hitting whatever price it is going to hit ($1,000, $10,000, $42,069???), eventually the price is going to come back to land (could be a week, a month, a year, who knows). When that happens, selling stock at a hugely inflated value based on earning performance (note that I have argued the price today of $GME is totally supported for economic reasons) is going to invite lawsuits galore, so perhaps the board (Which is risk averse by nature) doesn’t want to make a move without letting things settle out. Time will tell. Also, all of this free press has to be a boon for business and I have to believe that the board sees what happened with Robinhood (aka Robbin’ Gainz) where they totally disenfranchised their whole user base in a single day and saw the valuable lesson there. Thus, this is another reason that the $GME board probably won’t issue more shares to screw over the WSB investors, many of whom are their target market.

All that said, I want to see the $GME rocket broaching interstellar space like the rest of you MONKEs.🦍🍌🚀🌖🌖🌖🌖

Also, need to give some love to the rest of the $BANG stocks, $BB, $AMC, and $NOK. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Let’s hope the $GME board also has diamond hands and lets this ship fly!!!!!
💎👋🚀🌖

Edit 1: Tl;dr I predict 💎👋🦍🍌🚀🚀🚀🚀🌖, but there is a risk that the company refuels our ship prematurely.

Edit 2: I will qualify my comments by acknowledging the fact that the NYSE does have a “20% Rule” which generally requires shareholder approval for a NYSE-listed company from issuing more than 20% of its outstanding, so that is a real constrain as well. There are some exceptions to this, but no one wants to read more about this."|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|['$GME']|['GME']|['I', 'I', '$GME', 'I', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'DD', '$GME', 'WEVER', 'DD', '$GME', '$GME', '$GME', 'I', 'I', '$GME', 'I', '$GME', 'WSB', 'I', '$GME', '$BANG', '$BB', '$AMC', '$NOK', '$GME', 'I', 'I', 'NYSE']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'GME']

**ADM and Future for Sustainable Agriculture and Cost Reduction**

Ok, supposedly everyone cares about sustainable business models and the environment nowadays. Which they should. But sometimes it is a little more complicated than just buying an electric vehicle. Food production is a massive contributor to global CO2 emissions. See: [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507104446.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507104446.htm) (TLDR: Soybean trade is bad for the environment.)

Soybean and Corn is currently processed for animal feed. But guess what, you can create animal feed with minimal land, space and water. How? The answer is insect protein.

Insect Protein Animal Feed Industry

Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and InnovaFeed plan to begin building what will be the world’s largest insect protein facility in 2021 in the city of Decatur in central Illinois.

PROS:

\- Black soldier fly larvae eat non-compostable food waste bound for landfills + produce hundreds of times more protein per acre than traditional animal feed sources. This will be attractive to the public with the growing consciousness of environmental sustainability.

\- Current animal feed is sourced from soybean meal and corn meal. The massive quantities of corn and soybean farming requires large amounts of land and water. Insects can be grown indoors, requiring far less land and water.

\- **Not only does the farming of insects decrease CO2 emissions in itself, these insects eat and feed on WASTE. This food processing decreases CO2 emissions AND reduces landfill waste.**

CONS:

\- Insect food processing is still not cost competitive with traditional animal feed; however, innovation and sustainability always comes with a cost.

# TLDR

\- ADM is currently holding 10% less market cap while trading at a lower P/E and P/S. (Compared to CTVA, it's biggest competitor.)

\- ADM provides 2x the annual dividend (Compared to CTVA, its biggest competitor.) AKA BOOMERS LIKE DIS STOCK TOO.

\- ADM shows consistent (although slow) year over year growth. Current financials do not project ADM to be a growth stock. I believe this what causes it to trade at such a low price to earnings ratio (50% lower than market average); however, I believe their initiative for a more sustainable business model will change this in the long term.

\- Insect farming reduces required land and water. You can literally raise these in a small indoor facility anywhere in the world...or even the moon 🚀 🚀 . Insect farming has potential to be much cheaper than current business models. Insect farming reduces CO2 emissions and they feed for landfill waste. You can grow feed for livestock while reducing the amount of landfill waste AND reducing CO2 emissions.

Positions: I am only holding shares at the moment. As we are seeing a current market pull back, I will most likely enter LEAPS 1/20/2023 $55C. This allows time for the insect protein segment to develop. Who knows, maybe they can even get government tax incentives for this sustainable initiative. 🚀 🚀

## What Exactly Happened at Robinhood This Week?

There has been plenty of speculation this week about what exactly went down and unverified (although reasonable) rumors on why Robinhood did this. I’ll go over the top two theories before taking a deep dive into the “official” reason given by Robinhood.

[**Pressure from the White House and Sequoia according to a Robinhood employee**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/l723kf/robinhood_insider_information/)

This statement has been [refuted by Sequoia](https://www.newsweek.com/sequoia-capitol-denies-pressuring-robinhood-stop-gamestop-trading-after-viral-reddit-post-1565269). I personally wouldn’t believe the Sequoia part since I don’t really know what they would gain from it - they’re a Venture Capital firm, not a hedge fund, and would not be actively shorting stocks let alone be trading in stocks. It could be possible that the White House, or someone from the government did contact Robinhood - actually, I’d be pretty shocked if no one called them at some point this week to ask wtf was going on.During this call, they may have been afraid that GameStop’s short squeeze would have triggered a major financial crisis due to hedge funds collapsing and de-grossing, causing a mass selloff similar to what was seen in 2008 and in March 2020 - I’ll talk more about this later. Basically, without Robinhood shutting down GME from being bought, it’s actually very possible we would have seen the rest of the stock market collapse last week, and this was something the Biden administration was trying to make sure didn’t happen in the first month in office.

**Possible intervention from Citadel Securities**

This was a theory I personally believed in initially and would have been a very obvious area of scrutiny for many people. The most straightforward one being the fact that Citadel (the hedge fund) dumped a few billion into Melvin to bail it out a [few days ago](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340), who were the very well known shorts of GME. Citadel, the hedge fund, is owned by Citadel LLC, which happens to also run Citadel Securities - a market maker. If you don’t know what this is, go grow a few brain wrinkles and read my [previous post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ygab/dddd_how_rwallstreetbets_created_a_financial/). Citadel Securities is effectively Robinhood’s sugar daddy, directly being responsible for around [40% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/a-controversial-part-of-robinhoods-business-tripled-in-sales-thanks-to-high-frequency-trading-firms.html) in 2018 through their payment for order flow (i.e. selling your trades to Citadel, giving them the right of first refusal, and [potentially giving you a worse price](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321); this is how they get 0% commission trades btw).

Theoretically, Citadel the hedge fund and Citadel the market maker is run independently and sister companies both owned by Citadel LLC, but anyone can see this being a potential conflict of interest. There’s also a possibility that Citadel Securities losing billions of dollars being short so many GME calls (they write 99% of all options contracts) and probably not being perfectly Gamma and (especially) Vega hedged, so when those two greeks skyrocketed on GME they probably lost tons of money there. [According to WSB hero Chamath](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354947541125611526), he didn’t invest in Robinhood when they came to him on multiple occasions because he thought the founders lacked integrity, implying he believes they might have been the type of people to sell out their users (granted, they already literally do this) and do this type of shit.

**The Official Reason - Clearing House Limitations**

Let’s get to the [official reason put out by Robinhood](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility), which is that their clearing house, in this case the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, suddenly increased their collateral requirements on GME trades drastically. Apparently, **Robinhood is running out of cash**, so they weren’t able to provide the cash collateral demanded by DTCC, and hence weren’t able to trade through them. Let’s dumb this down and talk about how brokerages work.

Let’s talk about what a clearing house is and how they work. Imagine Bob wants to sell Dylan a share of GME. There’s a bunch of legal paperwork and logistics for actually transferring over the share, which can take a few days to finalize - this is called settlement. However, you don’t want people being able to back out of this exchange during this process for obvious reasons, so that’s where the clearing house comes in. Let’s call this clearing house Mary. What Mary does is facilitate (clear) this exchange, and ensures both Bob and Dylan follow through with their trade by having them both immediately give Mary cash as collateral while the exchange settles. If one party was no longer able to meet their end of the exchange (eg. Dylan goes bankrupt), Mary acts as an insurer and is responsible for buying the share from Bob instead. If it turned out that Bob was lying about actually owning a share and can't transfer it over to Dylan in time (failure to deliver), Mary is responsible for finding that share for him instead.

Since GME suddenly became very volatile, and the financial soundness of some parties and their ability to deliver their side of the trade have been suddenly called into question ([at least on the seller’s side](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)), DTCC decided  (...or due to pressure from other sources?) to increase the collateral needed for buying GME to be more than 10x of the proportion of the market value of whatever it was before. Most brokerages reacted to this by disabling margin trading. For some reason, Robinhood went one step further and disabled trading for all accounts, possibly due to their relatively small cash reserves compared to places like Fidelity, and the relatively large number of users who use margin in the platform.

## What’s Robinhood Going To Do About GME?

Robinhood’s decision to stop purchases of GME basically got hate from literally everyone, to the point where it somehow united the country in a beautiful way. Here’s a list of things that happened as a result of Robinhood’s decision, for fun

* [Ted Cruz retweeted AOC saying he completely agreed with her](https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905)
* [Protests at NYSE and Robinhood HQ](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/protesters-gather-at-robinhood-hq-nyse-in-response-to-restricted-stock-trades)
* [Class action lawsuit](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/investing/lawsuit-robinhood-gamestop-wallstreetbets/index.html)
* [Someone paid to have an airplane](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rlyx/this_guy_is_flying_a_banner_saying_suck_my_nuts/) fly around the Bay Area over Robinhood’s office saying “Suck my nuts Robinhood”
* [Angry Robinhood employees were given DoorDash credits for some reason?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7y5ka/robinhood_staff_unhappy_about_the_trading_hault/)
* [Congressional investigation to Robinhood’s decision](https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-job-posting-federal-affairs-congress-hearing-gamestop-reddit-2021-1)
* [SEC investigation to Robinhood’s decision](https://www.cnet.com/news/robinhood-troubles-sec-will-closely-review-actions-that-restricted-amc-gamestop-stock-trades/)

Clearly, this decision has single-handedly made Robinhood the most hated company in the world right now. It’s especially bad given the optics - their mission is to literally “democratize finance”, with the idea of empowering individual retail investors to be on the same level of institutions. This decision, whether intentional or not, has literally gone against everything about Robinhood’s image and mission, and will end the company if not fixed soon. **All of this right as Robinhood is planning to launch their IPO**.

The people in charge of Robinhood likely know all of this and are doing everything they can to find cash and liquidity to put up the collateral needed to resume GME trading. So far we’ve seen them raise $1B from investors and $500M through lines of credit overnight, although based on the fact that GME is still restricted, that doesn’t seem to be enough. However, in my personal opinion, I think it's likely that Robinhood is doing everything they can to find more money given the situation, and once they do, **they will likely re-enable trading on GME. If that happens (which IMO will probably be some time next week), GME and all other high-SI stocks will absolutely** 🚀🌝\*\*.\*\*

## How GME Almost Caused (and Still Can Cause) a Stock Market Crash

Let’s go over something else interesting that went on as a result of the GME short squeeze - the fact that it started to affect the stock market overall. In fact, the stock market had the largest decline since October across all sectors on Wednesday when GME, AMC, and other high-SI stocks surged, with a very sharp recovery as the meme stocks fell after Robinhood suspending purchases; this was one of the biggest de-grossing of hedge funds in history. [Chamath wrote a great Twitter thread about this](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354883147523997697), so amazing that I’ll just copy-paste his tweets rather than try to explain it better myself.

>*A children's book explanation of what's happening:*  
>  
>*1. If you are ""smart money"" you are allowed to take your $1 and leverage it up to $15+*  
>  
>*2. You can now buy $15 of stock AND if you promise to short companies, you can short $15 of stock as well*  
>  
>*3. In finance language, this means that you are $30 ""gross"" ($15 of longs + $15 of shorts) but $0 net (+$15 of longs -$15 of shorts). This makes everyone feel good because it feels like you are taking zero risk...but in reality, your $1 is exposed to $30 of risk.*  
>  
>*4. Now you go around and tell your friends about both your longs and your shorts and when you do it at a restaurant vs on Reddit, its called an ""ideas dinner"".*  
>  
>*5. You also publish your longs on a quarterly lag via an SEC rule.  You don't have to tell anyone about your shorts.*  
>  
>*6. Now the less cool people who weren't invited to the ideas dinners, start copying your longs based on your report.*  
>  
>*7. You realize that publicizing your shorts is also a good idea so instead of only selling stocks, you also BUY options (puts) which has to be reported.*

>  
>*13. Now a massive short squeeze starts.  You have to cover your shorts ASAP. But the banks also notice that you don't have enough credit to cover the $30 they lent you and ask for more collateral. You now also have to sell your long positions.*

>*14. What happens next is that a cascade of short covering and long selling starts driving some stocks to the moon and others way down.  Which stocks went up? Basically the ones that were the most heavily shorted by you and your buddies in the first place.*

[Hedge fund grossing \/ de-grossing](https://preview.redd.it/c5we1d7e0se61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a11131168d69e5f3aea93c8fd087a1478500ddc)

In other words, as stocks like GME go up, the highly-leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts. Most retail investors are limited to 2x leverage, but since hedge funds are “hedged” by taking short and long positions, they can be up to 30x levered since theoretically they would be shielded from external events that cause all stocks to go up or down in price (i.e. Beta neutral), so they’re “safer”. To get out of these short positions, they will need to massively unwind their long positions as well so they can still have a reasonable “Net Exposure”, triggering a sell-off in those stocks.

A very similar thing actually happened in March (with risk-parity) causing hedge funds to similarly massively de-gross, and literally everything from GLD to even AMZN’s stock price dropping as a result, even though theoretically COVID-19 would’ve been good for both from a fundamental basis, as we saw later on. It’s very likely that if Robinhood hadn’t stopped purchases of GME, many more hedge funds shorts would have had their shorts blow up and be forced to continue to de-gross causing a widespread stock market crash, potentially being the catalyst for finally popping the [decade-long liquidity (leverage)-fueled asset bubble we’ve been experiencing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) In fact, this could still happen since it doesn’t look like hedge funds have learned their lesson and **are still heavily short GME with Net Shares Shorts barely moving this week** [**according to S3 Partners**](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355225495835709441)**.** Furthermore, despite seeing the largest de-grossing of hedge funds since 2009, **gross exposure (aka leverage) of hedge funds still remains** [**close to record-high levels**](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-hedgefunds/goldman-sees-hedge-fund-exposures-close-to-records-ongoing-sell-off-risk-after-gamestop-swings-idUSL1N2K60GW).

**TLDR**

In case your attention span was too short to read everything above,

1. Robinhood is going to be doing everything they can to raise cash to resume GME purchases, when this happen GME 🚀🌝
2. Much of the stock market’s value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so **if GME (and other common shorts) 🚀🌝 the rest of the stock market might collapse around it (EDIT - as hedge funds re-consider their long / short strategy), triggering a financial crisis**

*Now, just to be clear, buying GME right now is joining a game of hot potato; the longer you hold the potato the more tendies you get to eat for dinner, but at some point this will all blow up and when it does someone will be the bagholder - and right now everyone is rooting for these bagholders to be the hedge funds that are short GME. That being said, with Short Interest barely moving this week, this day of reckoning doesn’t look like it’ll be coming in the next few days and for reasons mentioned above, it’s probably more likely for GME to reach $1K next week than the probability that it’ll fall below $100.*

Or in other words, [I like these stocks](https://www.highshortinterest.com/).

EDIT - Appearently S3 Partners just contradicted [their tweet on Friday](https://s3partners.com/Exclusive.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=announcement&utm_campaign=10ds) and now indicate that shares short of GME have dipped below 30M shares. Still highly shorted compared to most other stocks, fwiw.

EDIT2 - Getting alot of questions on how one short position in a small cap can do this, and my answer is that GME alone wouldn't cause a financial crisis, but rather what GME represents, which is disproving that hedge funds that a long / short strategy (i.e. taking out additional leverage to short similar companies they long) is unviable; The word from my hedge fund friends is that this type of thing would have been considered a six-sigma event, or one in a billion chance of happening; which is obviously no longer true. Hedge funds seeing Melvin go down will probably start re-consider their short books. This on mass will cause a mass short-covering and also sell-off of their longs.

I know this sub is getting absolutely bombarded with random hot takes and DD’s, but I’m hoping this might be an analogy that helps a lot of people understand GME and the squeeze that’s happening, and will be unique enough to stay. 


If you’re still struggling to understand the squeeze, shorting and the $GME trends, I’m here to help. Bear with me. (No, not that bear). 

This is gonna be really oversimplified, but be different than 🦍 and 🍌.

So, imagine a college star, up and coming high draft pick. Most sports are apt for this analogy, but NFL works best. 


This is a QB projected #1 pre-season. He’s legit. bona-fide, undeniable talent. Let’s call him Game Stop, (Stop, #69). 

He’s on a shit team and gets dealt a shit hand for 2020 (bad team + pandemic. Limits games played, falling off the radar). 

Now let’s a few things happen: 

1.) Someone makes a massive bet that Game Stop is washed, terrible and will never recover, but they have to borrow money to make that bet. They hate the player because they’re old and resentful and afraid of death, and they want to do everything they can to prevent this young player from succeeding. They want to force them to fail by making everyone else believe they will fail. 

2.) A new head coach gets hired, someone who is absolutely qualified and primed to bring out the absolute best in Game Stop, and revolutionize and evolve their game. 

3.) A random dude on the internet notices how high the bet is against the player, Game Stop. They think to themselves, “Hey, I’ve seen that dude play. His talent is undeniable, and he’s got the perfect new coach. There is no WAY he’s gonna be that bad”. 

4.) This dude let’s his buddies know about how high the bet against the player, Game Stop, is, and they agree. There is no WAY they’re that bad, especially with the new coach! There’s no way this bet can win, this is easy money!

5.) Word about the bet spreads like wildfire. Not only do more and more people do their research and watch game tape and realize how talented the player is, they realize how insane the bet against him is. 

Now, Game Stop (#69) starts to get back on track. They start playing games again and show their potential, their talent. They’re making a playoff run. Now they’re gaining more and more attention, and MORE people realize they’re gonna succeed. 

The original person who bet against the player, who was convinced they were washed, starts to panic. The person they borrowed the money from is starting to see what’s going on, and starts to ask for the money back. Every game that Game Stop plays, they prove themselves more and more, and the bet against them gets even more spicy. At this point, the bettor borrows even more money and DOUBLES DOWN, stubborn and convinced the player will fail and prove they were right. 

People aren’t having it. They’ve SEEN the games, they KNOW the talent, there is absolutely no way this player isn’t legit, no possible way for them to fail. They bet even more in support. They KNOW he’ll succeed, make the playoffs and win the championship and be the #1 pick. 

At this point, the person who bet against him is losing an insane amount of money. There is no way they can pay back the original bet. They’ll be absolutely ruined and embarrassed. Somehow, they have enough power to stop the player from playing games. They take the games off TV, they  delete the highlight videos, they go to the news screaming “This player is terrible. Trash, washed. Anyone who doesn’t believe that is delusional, wrong, and will lose a lot of money”. 
It doesn’t matter, everyone has already seen the games, the highlights, the talent, with their OWN EYES. It’s undeniable. The bet is terrible, and the new coach fits perfectly. 

Every single day the bettor doesn’t cut his losses, the person he borrowed from adds interest to the total they owe. They’re getting impatient and they see the writing on the wall. BUT, if they wanna continue, that’s fine, the bettor will just have to pay even more money at the end.


That’s where we’re at now. Exactly that. 

All it comes down to now, is all of us believing what we’ve already known, what we’ve already seen. They can take down the videos, they can blackout the media, they can keep them from even playing a game, but it’s too late. WE’VE SEEN IT. WE KNOW. WE KNOW THE TALENT, THE COACH, AND HOW BAD THE BET IS. 

All we have to do is believe in ourselves, and trust in the talent we’ve seen, and stick to our guns about how terrible the bet against the player was. Every moment that goes by, every game they play, the bet gets worse, and our position gets better. 

No matter what, the original better has to call it quits and take their losses, but they will do EVERYTHING they can to make us stumble, falter, fear. To make us doubt ourselves and what we’ve seen, what we know. They can’t. 


We watched this player in elementary school, in middle school, in high school, and college. They brought us countless moments of joy, and sometimes of sadness. We lost with them, but more importantly, we WON with them. How fucking DARE someone bet against them and their talent, and intentionally try to ruin their career, just out of spite, to make a profit. 

We know this player, we trust this player, we like this player, we believe in this player, and if we hold this player, by fucking God this player and everyone who believed in them, will win. We’ll succeed. 

And that son of a bitch who tried to ruin them? They lose everything.

Hello silver surfers, clang gang, and monkeys who enjoy shiny things

Thank you for helping [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the_real_dd_on_slv_the_worlds_biggest_short/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) go viral and make it on Zerohedge (dreams fulfilled).

Before I get GME hate mail, let me clarify I am still long GME and am looking for the moon in GME.  I also have a small long silver position.  Both positions are quite small as I am unfortunately not super well capitalized.  Many of the comments about buys on the previous post referenced order sizes I can only dream of at the moment, but I'm damn glad we have so much conviction behind this trade.

I created an official [Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/Thehappyhawaii1/status/1355663208774836228?s=20). Not sure if I’ll use it, but didn’t want anyone to impersonate me.

Clang gang acted so fast, that all the bullion dealers sold out over the weekend which is incredible, and overnight futures are spiking as we speak.  I continue to support the purchase of physical silver as a way to continue the short squeeze if you can find any of course.  The short squeeze thesis is built upon tying up as much of the physical silver into our diamond hands as possible.  With that said, I thought I would add some clarity to my position on the various options out there to play the silver squeeze.

**It is organized into 2 sections:**

**1. the futures market (for big players)**

**2. alternatives (for smaller players**)

&#x200B;

**1.**

**The futures market:** for the squeeze to really happen, we desperately need some of the bigger pocketed players who have access to the futures market to purchase silver contracts on the open market.  **If you can play in the futures market, it is imperative that you do so.**  I have been trying to find a retail broker who will allow customers to take physical delivery rather than force cash settlement but have had no luck so far.  If anyone knows of such a retail broker, please let me know so I can update the post with the info.  This is by far the most important piece of the short squeeze equation.

Let me explain:

When traders hold long futures contracts to expiration, they are making a statement that they want to take delivery.  Taking delivery does not mean the silver is transferred to your house, but rather it goes to the CME warehouse.  You can go pick it up from the warehouse or arrange transfer, or you can pay $8.50 a month per 1000 ounces to just store it at the warehouse (which is quite cheap at that scale).  The futures market allows players to use extreme amounts of margin and leverage, which is where the 'naked shorts' come from.  They are able to sell massive amounts of silver with very little collateral to back it up, and no actual silver on hand.  **This also explains why institutions such as citadel or others hold positions in the ETFs like SLV.** If you have more than 50,000 shares in SLV, you can request to have your share of the silver delivered to you.  They are hedging against their naked shorts in the futures market by trying to gain access to a source of silver should they need it.  The thing is, if the short squeeze occurs, even their holdings in SLV will not be enough to meet their obligations.

In order for the buyers to call their bluff they need to not use their margin power, as tempting as it may be to do so.  They need to only purchase as much silver in the futures market as they actually have money in their account to cover the final purchase (the price is locked in at the time of the futures contract purchase).  Then as expiration approaches, refuse to settle in cash, and pony up the money to actually buy the silver and have it delivered.  At that time the seller needs to find silver fast, and tries to purchase it from somewhere else to meet their contractual obligations.  The rush of all the naked shorts to try and find physical silver is what massively drives up the price and causes the short squeeze.

There may even be dips in the futures market if the buyers are planning to do the squeeze.  This is because they will not be using margin whiles the seller are.  The sellers may be able to push the price down temporarily, but when expiration comes they will find themselves in one hell of a bind when they find out all of the buyers actually have the cash in their accounts to take delivery and refuse to settle in cash.

As the supply of silver dries up and literally there is no way to fulfill the obligations of the long contract holders, the silver futures market will actually be effectively shut down.  The CME will force settle all remaining contracts for cash at the current market rate (which will have spiked dramatically).  This is the last thing the CME wants to do, and will only do it as a final last resort.  If this occurs we can declare victory at having exposed the silver futures market for the fraud that it is.  A futures market is built on the trust that the sellers can actually deliver the product they are selling, and if they can't then that trust is destroyed.  If you go long and they don't have the silver to give you, you will still be paid the money for that amount of silver at the going rate.

Following this collapse the futures market will relaunch at a 1-1 margin requirement.  This means that for every silver ounce sold, the seller will actually have to have the silver or at least the collateral to cover that exact amount of silver on the open market.  The futures market will have moved from 250-1 paper to physical, to 1-1.  The massive banks who were naked short will have lost tens or maybe even hundreds of billions of dollars collectively.  In my previous post I implied it was likely JP Morgan naked shorting.  They have a history of doing so and being fined for manipulation, but we don't actually know which big players are the current naked shorts and who might even be net long.

**2.**

**This is where the rest of us come in...** if you can't play the futures market, you can still purchase and tie up physical silver where the naked shorts can't access it.  Thus setting up the environment for the squeeze to occur.  Whether its WSB players or some other big fund who sees what is happening and does the futures part themselves, they will only be able to do so because of the smaller purchases of silver by millions of smaller players.

**Physical silver:** by purchasing physical silver you are taking silver off the market that the shorts will need when the squeeze occurs.  You aren't directly causing the short squeeze, you are helping to set up the environment for the squeeze to occur, and you will have the silver to sell after the squeeze happens.

**Silver ETFs (SLV, PSLV, SIVR):** this is the same concept as the physical silver.  By purchasing silver ETFs you are locking up physical into the ETF's vaults, which wont be able to be able to be purchased by the shorts in the futures market because they belong to the ETF shareholders.  There has been a ton of chatter about whether ETFs should be used at all, and of the ETFs which is the best or most reliable.  Frankly if you have doubts about the ETFs, just don't use them.  All of the physical silver is already sold out so this is the easiest way for most people to play at this point.  If you prefer physical but it’s sold out or selling for ridiculous premiums, just buy the ETFs until the premiums come down and then sell the ETF to purchase more physical. It is possible that at some point SLV (or other ETFs) will no longer create new shares as silver becomes impossible to find (thus they cant create a new share because they can't the silver to back it up).   At that point the ETFs will likely trade at a hefty premium to NAV and it may no longer make sense to purchase them.  But that hasn't occurred yet so I'd say it still certainly makes sense to buy these ETFs.  We have no proof that they are lying about their silver holdings, and if they disallow new share creation, I'd say that means they really aren't lying about their holdings, otherwise they would happily take as much investment as we would give them to collect management fees.

**Call options on Silver ETFs:** Calls will have a similar effect to purchasing the ETFs as the market maker will have to purchase the underlying ETF to be hedged.  It has a levered effect that can both hurt and help the squeeze depending on which direction the silver price is headed.

**Miners:** miners will benefit from the squeeze but buying them doesn't help the squeeze occur in any direct way.  People buying miners will benefit if we are successful, but the more capital that flows into them rather than the alternatives, it will lower the chances of the squeeze being successful in the first place.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

**if monke have lot of money, long futures with no margin and take delivery.**

**If monke not have lot of money, buy physical silver bullion and silver ETFs**

Hopefully this answered some of the questions that flooded my inbox from the previous post.  Good luck to all.  GME and SLV to moon.  Lets squeeze the naked shorts, expose the manipulation, and take our tendies from the hedge funds.

The TD ameritrade % held by institutions changed today...to 112.39%... which is an odd number because that would mean that there is 71-72 million share. However there are only 69.7M shares. Me being the autist I am, I checked for SEC filings which I couldn't find anything as of friday. Used a calculator (its that weird thing with number buttons) to count each institutions holdings and it checked out to the reported number. 

I'm not claiming that I'm smart, in fact I'm a dumbass who made most of his gains off of TLSA. However, and this is a big however, unless I am even dumber then I think I am, there can not be more than 100% of a companies shares. This means that EVEN THE INSTITUTIONS ARE HOLDING ARTIFICIAL SHARES. 

Again the if comes in, if I'm not a total dumbass, it means that just the institutions have the ability to diamond hand this bitch into infinity.  

So overall where does this leave the retards and autists and fomoers. Well, I don't fucking know. Some how this situation has to fix itself, if the government steps in we might get fucked. GME could step in and we get fucked. OR the free market resolves itself and we all go to uranus where there is a special tendie town built for gmetards.

I am not a financial advisor, nothing I say holds any weight, I'm just an idiot who noticed an oddity in some percentages.

We're in uncharted territory here and are witnessing a short squeeze which has never been seen before. We also don't have retrospect to show us what really happened as it all played out.

But we can look to the fabled Volkswagen short squeeze a while ago. I don't care about short interest or float or whatever: Volkswagen became the biggest company in the world at that time due to a short squeeze. If we consider market cap alone, how high can GME go?

Let's use 1 trillion as a nice round number. Sure there are companies with larger caps, but fuck I don't want to complicate things. GME (according to corrupt-as-fuck Robinhood) has a cap of 17 billion. Divide 1 trillion by this and we get the number 57. GME has to go up 57 times it's current price to be a trillion dollar company. 

330*57 is about $19,000 per share. If this squeeze played out like VW back in the day, we can look forward to at least this target. I could be wrong, I could be retarded, but this is what the math is pointing to if history somewhat repeats itself.

TL:DR: Buy and hold GameStop with 💎 ✋.

Anyway, here what I think these sneaky fuckers did:

Let’s say Melvbitch is short 100 shares. He needs to get 100 shares somehow to close this position to make it look like he got out of his short, but how does he get them? Calls. 

So, he buys a $0.5 1/29 call and exercises it (we will assume that SIG actually has the shares, so this doesn’t trigger a gamma squeeze). But, he needs money to buy and exercise this bad boy, and where does he get that? Calls again. 

So, he sells 4-5 (based on what I am seeing value wise) OTM calls to get this money. This maintains his short position whilst making it appear that he is no longer short SHARES. He can also spread to the news that he closed a short position. 

If these OTM calls that he sold them expire OTM, he wins and gets out of the short basically. 

But no, thanks to the norse legend himself and all of you diamond handed autists, those bad boys expired ITM on Friday. Did Melvbitch have the shares for when these options got exercised, no. Did he get assigned them and is therefore still short despite making it appear that he is out? Yes. Now this fucker has to buy even more shares than he originally owed. 

Tldr: if I am correct, the S3 data is missing the options fuckery that they performed last week and they still have to buy hella shares. 

GME 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💎🙌

Edit: someone pls correct me if the S3 data would catch assigned shares."|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'SIG', 'I', 'OTM', 'HARES', 'OTM', 'OTM', 'ITM', 'I', 'GME']|['GME', 'SIG', 'GME']

**Thesis:**  
With the advent of online gaming and e-sport, Gamestop is prime to make a turnaround and grow again assuming it will change direction and adapt post Covid. The support of Ryan Cohen, a e-commerce marketing guru, has brought hope to a once-beloved brand and ignited the flame of this reality.  The stock is also enticing because of its 138% short interest which is the highest percentage in the market. Thus, a remote chance of a short squeeze could occur. *Majority of investors do actually believe in the company and is not in it for  just the short squeeze opportunity. *    
&nbsp;

--  
**Background:**  
Gamestop was once the most prolific gaming retailer in the brick and mortar time period. They made their profits by rebuying used games/gaming paraphernalia at low prices and marking them up greatly. They relied mainly on foot traffic due to a subpar online presence and they were slow to change. The low price and convenience of online shopping had won over shoppers causing the demise of brick and mortar. Large brands started disappearing left and right and now it was Gamestop's turn with a boost from Covid. Investors wrote GameStop off as a dinosaur company with its shares eventually dropping to $2.5 dollar.

--  
**Results:**   
Hedge funds saw this and decided to go short on them, betting on their demise like all the others. The funds abused the mechanism of the market to cause a large selling pressure onto the stock, forcing the stock price down and accelerating the demise. Could this be manipulation? If a hedge fund were to short a company out of spite, they could very possibly bankrupt a company.  

--  
**How did Gamestop survive for so long?**  
Even though they weren't raking in e-commerce profit, they were still profitable. It was just that that profit stream was shrinking. The profits were also concentrated at a fraction of their stores. As they closed unprofitable stores, they were able to offset cost slightly. Investors were also holding on to the imminent release of the new console super cycle. Investors noted that the golden days were right after the new consoles were released and Dec 2020 couldn't come quicker. Gamestop was patience and managed their financials well with a strong balance sheet. Investors had underpriced the real estate of theirs. They were not valued for growth anymore so they weren't in a situation to raise capital risk free. They have several billions in short-term and long-term debt but  they had 600 million cash in hand to cushion with. Lastly, the Nintendo switch had just came out and was the best selling gaming console ever. Gamestop rode the tailend of Nintendo success all through 2020 with Switch sales offsetting losses in the other gaming segments.

**The turnaround:**  
A new management team had join in August 2019 that set to slim down the company. They were much more aggressive and sought to aggressively close stores. A comprehensive turnaround plan called GameStop ReBoot  was announced with 4 elements:   
  
1. Optimized the Core Business  
	Reducing unprofitable stores and focusing on what works  
2. Become the Social / Cultural Hub for Gaming  
	Turning Gamestop into a experience center and not just a store  
3. Build a Frictionless Digital Ecosystem  
	Revamp the supply chain to be e-commerce focused  
4. Transform Vendor Partnership  
	Rekindle and make new partnerships   
  
Like all new managements, this one needed time but unfortunately Covid complicated the plans. Investors became increasingly doubtful and even bearish. However, they had underestimated the future of gaming. 

--  
The first significant move was bringing Reginald Fils-Aimé onto the board of directors. Reginald was known for his market prowess bring Nintendo to what it is today. Investors loved that. 

--  
As Covid happened, working from home and home entertainment exploded. Logitech, Corsair, Bestbuy exploded. Online gaming was projected to be very ludicrous in the next decade and Covid had shorten this timeline. Online gaming took off. Activision, Electronic Arts, Zynga, Tencent all exploded. Apple app revenue from their gaming segment exploded. Investors had repriced these stocks higher taking advantage of the first player advantage. One notable company that changed in valuation was Logitech, they were a value company but relabeled to growth. What was missing from this list was Gamestop. The bullishness in gaming was there and everyone else profited. If there was hope of a GME turnaround, their valuation model would certainly flip to a growth model at higher PE multiples. It was only fair.    

--  
The next big event that occurred  was in October 2020. Gamestop announced a partnership with Microsoft which was the first real tangible milestone on the turnaround plan. Investors started to give the company a second look.  Microsoft Partnership caused shares to rally 30% in a day. A bullish sign that the big players haven't given up. However this was short lived as shorts continue to drive the price down as there was no concrete details on the revenue sharing partnership, only that ""for every Microsoft Xbox console that GameStop sells going forward, GameStop will get some percentage of the revenue from every digital full game download, DLC, microtransaction, and any subscriptions as well."" To me this sounds very bullish that Microsoft still believes in Gamestop.  
 
--  
Next came news that the well-respected businessmen Ryan Cohen released that he had bought up 13% of Gamestop shares, becoming a minority owner. Ryan Cohen was the founder of Chewy, a Petsmart online branch that outcompeted Amazon. Investors labeled him an e-commerce guru/genius. He had bought shares at $4.81 and slowly gobbled up more as the price increased. Rumors started speculating that Cohen would takeover and transform Gamestop and it was materialized when Cohen sent the management a very aggressive letter.  

--  
""GameStop’s leadership should immediately conduct a strategic review of the business and share a credible plan for seizing the tremendous opportunities in the rapidly-growing gaming sector. GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences – not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem.""  

--  
It was a do this or else there will be a hostile takeover. The letter was sent three weeks before Q3 Earnings and investors were now watching intensively for details of a roadmap or of a Cohen reference during the earning call. ER came around and management was mute beside the announcement of a shelf offering of 100mil. Company performance wise, they were negative on profit but had still beaten expectations. The expedited closure of unprofitable of the stores helped. The stock would have soared had not an offering been announce (offering dilutes shares) so instead GME dropped 17%. From the conference calls, many bull investors felt reluctantly weary of this turnaround while some even dismissed management consideration of Ryan and piled on to the shorts. A week later, a filing by Ryan Cohen showed that he had continued to believe that the stock was undervalued and bought even at $14.83. This news rekindled the speculation that Ryan Cohen was going to do a takeover. Stock bounced and soared to $22.35 dollars for the next few weeks before dropping to $17.35.    

--  
**Jan 2021 - The first squeeze:**  
Shorts were still convinced that Gamestop would not be turn around and so they held steady with a short interest above 130%. Some short sellers had left while new ones piled on.    

--  
Monday, Jan 11th, Gamestop decided to drop bombs to the short:  
- First with an announcement that there was 309% increase in e-commerce sales from 2019 holiday season, 4.8% increase in comparable store sales, 3.1% decrease in total sales.  
	- The biggest takeaway was that their new e-commerce strategy was working. 309% increase is massive. Also this followed their original plan to concentrate on their core. Rise in sales of profitable store was also shown. The closure unprofitable stores hit their total sales but it was not much and implied that these stores were dead weight. They slimmed their bleeding cost segment and increased their profit. This was super bullish.  
- Secondly, a board of advisor switch up was announced. Ryan Cohen and two main Chewy guys were hopping on, replacing 3 other people. 
	- Ryan essentially brought Chewy Management to Gamestop. They know have 1/3 of the company's vote.  
	- GME Management knew that a takeover was happening, hostile or not and so they opened the doors. They also expanded Ryan Cohen's ability to buy up to 20% of the total shares  
	- Permit And Hestia Capital also align more with his vision so that would put them at a 5/9 majority  
Result: Even with the news, the stock price stayed range bound at 20.5 and volume was extremely low for that Monday and Tuesday.  Shorts were once again depressing the price. However, Wednesday came and the first of the shorts closed their position while bulls bought calls. The stock soared. This catalyzed into a gamma squeeze to kick off the huge rally.  

--  
The analysis stopped dead of the gamma squeeze as these recent events have been a gray area of interpretation. Enjoy.

dick-eating bear thesis that the SQUEEZE has in fact, been ALREADY SQUOZE.**

_Let me preface that for all the 5M newbies to this sub, I
am saddened that my favorite sub since 2017 has been invaded by normies. But at
the same time, I am excited for all the new amount of fodder (yeah, you) for
memes. So WELCOME TO THE GANG, GANG &lt;3_

**

THESIS: The big short squeeze has already happened.**

**

When?**

Approximately from the when our lord and savior Burry probably cashed out
(sometime before his settlement date for 13-F filing coming out in 2 weeks
time) to when the news broke and Cramer shat his pants on CNBC last Monday.

**

Why do you think this?**

First, MELVIN was NOT the ONLY ones SHORT, they were just
the slowest ones to cover (and hence probably will continue to be the poster-child for
bukkake gang-rape by millennials and zoomers with stimmy checks).

Second, GME literally went from $5 per share to $37 per
share by January 15, 2021, the settlement date for the latest short float
update (I’ll come back to your fucking daily updates from S3 Partners and Ortex
later on, and why I don’t trust them).

To put it into perspective for these unscrupulous, criminal,
BIG money positions on the short-side that have been here a LOOOONG time,
that’s already a 750% loss.

If someone had put in **JUST** $1M in August 2020 (by the
way, the short float % was around 99% at this time, so I KNOW more got in short
after this) hoping for a Gamestop bankruptcy, by Jan 15, 2021 these fuckers
would have lost $8M in total (initiating position would have been about 200K
shares short, by the time it gets to 1/15/2021, $37 x 200K shares =  $7.4M.

So, by wagering $1M on the short side, you now have to buy
back and return your shares. You now have a $6.4M loss.

**WELL THAT FUCKING SUCKS? Right? Well then what does a 400-IQ,
uncircumcized-dick hedgie with a wedgie want to do about this situation? They
GOTTA make that loss back SOMEWAY SOMEHOW.**

You could suck trucker dick or deal drugs, but these
white-collar yuppies have enough power to NOT have to stoop down to that level.

**

Here is how they CAN, and probably ARE, doing it right
now:**

Melvin wasn’t the only short position. Just the most
retarded one that didn’t cover in time, so they had to go through a whole
fucking liquidity crisis, class action lawsuit, and dick-eating meme-fest while
literally asking for sugar-daddy money. What about the less retarded short
positions? Well, they probably have some losses too, because I mean, they did
get squeezed in the earlier portion of the play, but now they have sights on
something else.

**First, your hedgies (excluding Melvin & Citron)
continue to push the narrative: “Throw Melvin & Citron to the masses and
keep the retail investors coming in with their diamond hands and high school
diplomas.”**

Second, **hedgies go LONG on GME shares now**. WTF HOW?
Well remember that for short positions, there are LENDERS of these shares.
These lenders would happily let go of their positions at the “top” of a
squeeze. (It’s ez fucking profit, and they want none of this mess).

Third, you now have a long position with underlying shares.
What’s the best play here? You fucking write call options because the vol
premiums are literally mooning at the moment. And I’ve been on WSB long enough
to know that WSB’s risk management is literally just selling one-paired organ
to afford the option premium on FDs.

Lastly, you push the narrative of a “GAMMA SQUEEZE” which is
JUST a little bit too hard for your average joe from Mississippi to understand
with his Algebra 2 from high school – Essentially telling him, “HEY THERES
STILL MORE TO SQUEEEEEZE.”

 

**

REAL Gs MOVE IN SILENCE:**

Look at the volumes, the float rotation in the past week for
GME is already enough to have fucked virgins 20 times and sacrificed them to
capitalist gods. 

Which means for hedgies with wedgies, it’s no longer a
tail-risk, blind-side event, it’s time to REAP the souls of every stimmy check
fool, by “MaRkET MAkInG”.

If I am that Hedgie, I write call options, while maintaining
a façade that I will “rationally” hedge those positions by buying more of the
underlying shares. FUN FACT: I already have them.

You stimmy check tards will keep buying into GME, because
you heard about it in the news over the weekend and want to get in on this
action to “STICK IT TO THE MAN” because 2020 has been an absolute suicidal
descent into madness because of COVID. You will probably go on for a couple
more days this upcoming week, now that liquidity restrictions are slowly being
lifted on trading platforms.

SO, while you fools supply buying volume, all I have to do
is collect my premiums on option sales, while slowly unwinding my underlying
share positions, and thereby also managing risk of option assignment since I’ll
sell shares into every spike and swerve the price away from the strike price of
YOUR options.

And I’ll also have an expectation as to where GME could
potentially rise to. You just look at the WSB subscriber count, multiply that
by the avg retail trader account liquidity.

You guys will think you have stuck it to the man, but the
man is sticking your wife ALREADY, ever since the moment you got angry and
emotional about an opportunity to unleash your pent up hatred towards the Wall
Street system. All I am saying is, for every tard like Melvin, there’s 20 other
hedgies out there to fuck you up without you even realizing it. After all it’s
done, they’ll even make you feel bad, saying you were “Greedy” and “Reckless”,
further perpetuating emotional volatility in markets that they will keep
profiting off of.

So while the retail GME HODLER thinks there’s still enough
gold raining from the top of midtown Manhattan, all they’re getting is piss and
pre-cum.

 

**

APPENDIX – Ortex & S3 Partners**

If you got all the way through until now, I apologize for my
lack of presentation in this thesis, it’s literally 3AM in the East Coast US
because I’m up for 4AM pre-market (don’t fucking judge me, I’m a retard too).

So I’ll explain that point from WAY up there about short
interest estimates.

I don’t give a flying fuck what Ortex and S3 Partners says.
I do NOT believe that short float is STILL above %100 after the official data
came out on 1/27 with a lag of two fucking weeks from its settlement date on
1/15. The stock price moved so egregiously that every autist in Manhattan would
have literally gone bankrupt if they’re still short, NOT just Melvin.

See, here’s the thing. If the system is ALREADY built with
this **two weeks lag** on short data for individual stocks, what fucking
data analytics company in their right mind would NOT try to take advantage of
this time & information arbitrage? The system is FUCKED, but it gets
perpetuated because the ones perpetuating this have the MOST to gain.

Ortex and S3 Partners is purely a marketing ploy, they
hopped on this gravy train to get your subcriptions and some more clicky-clicks
on their website traffic so they can use those metrics to raise some more funds
later on.

And even if they believed in your cause, no smart data
analytics firm would willingly give up that information arbitrage to the
public, if they want to ever think about doing business with ANY hedge-fund in
town.

Therefore, I am sticking to my autistic thought that the
system is stacked (which most of you agree) against us. BUT, I urge you to be a
little bit more careful, because short float data can be misleading at best and
a total fraudulent bull-trap at worst. 

Again, If you are new here, welcome to the gang. This sub
will always be about losing money and becoming best friends with your wife’s
boyfriend. But over time, it will be about the friends and knowledge you gained
along the way.

Inspired by his analysis, I wanted to investigate the SEC's publicly available Failed to Deliver data and see how it compared to other companies over time.

I wrote some code to process the the raw SEC data and normalize the shares that failed to deliver by the total number of outstanding shares of the company. This gives us a view that where each company's FTD shares are expressed as a percentage of the outstanding, so we can fairly compare companies to one another.

(Before you ask, yes I account for fluctuating values of outstanding shares.)

I went back to the beginning of 2019, looking at a few of the recent meme stocks with short squeezes as well as the top 10 (by weight) in the S&P 500 as well as GE (as an example of a stock with very low short interest). Here's what I found.

[This is not normal.](https://preview.redd.it/9us7kdme1ue61.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddf843285adac642c3d15360c71e14ed04566a38)

Shares can fail to deliver for many reasons, but when large numbers of shares fail to deliver a likely explanation is naked short selling. For a thorough explanation of this, see [this article](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html).

Back in early 2019, both GME and AMC look like the others. All had sub-1% of their outstanding shares end up as FTD. But starting in mid 2019, both GME and AMC experienced three waves of progressively larger naked short selling attacks. This is known as [scaling in](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scale-in.asp).

I wanted to see if I could find corroborating evidence of news and price data which aligned in time with these waves of naked shorting. What I found were two stories, both similar, explaining how GME and AMC got to where they are today.

# GameStop

The first wave (small bet) of naked shorts occurred in June and July of 2019. GME reported Q1 '19 earnings on June 4th after hours, with a [bleak future outlook](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/06/05/gamestop-stock-plunges-nearly-percent-gamers-brace-new-era-consoles/). Overall sales was down $1.5B, net income plunged by 78%. This story is what formed the core of the bear thesis. The stock dropped 36% on the news.

[GME Q1 '19 Earnings. Oof.](https://preview.redd.it/vbrosels1ue61.png?width=2804&format=png&auto=webp&s=b04f103567aa52b8af929191f14fbae86a41f0e4)

But things changed when Q2 '19 earnings came around. Yes, sales were down again and the numbers didn't look good, but the company announced it was going to [reboot with a major strategic update](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/09/10/1913815/0/en/GameStop-Reports-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2019-Results.html). They were going to make their retail stores more efficient by closing some locations, focus on becoming a social hub for gaming, and build a digital platform around the relaunched GameStop website.

Investors liked the news and the stock tries to move upwards, but is repeatedly beaten down. This lines up with the second wave of naked shorting. The original short sellers couldn't let the price float up, so they resorted to more than doubling down on their original naked short bet to keep the stock trending downward.

[Naked Shorts double down, gotta drive it to zero faster than they can rebuild!](https://preview.redd.it/p6x5x8zw1ue61.png?width=2772&format=png&auto=webp&s=382b78b87a737dc480f85bccea573096ca681706)

Finally COVID hits the US in March and April. Lockdowns happen and it becomes clear that nobody is going to malls anytime soon. This is where the third and final massive wave of naked short selling happens, attempting to push GME into bankruptcy. Remember, that's always the goal with naked short selling. If the company goes bankrupt, especially with a convenient parallel story (""It was a failing company anyway and COVID was the nail in the coffin!""), then nobody bothers to look into how many counterfeit shares might be floating around out there. They aren't worth anything, so who cares!

At its peak, **over 20% of the company's entire outstanding shares were failing to deliver every month**. This is confirmed by a tweet from Michael Burry (since deleted, he scrubs his tweets) that says when he tried to recall his lent-out shares, it took his broker **many weeks** to locate them. Remember, companies normally have well below 1% of their outstanding shares fail to deliver every month.

# AMC Entertainment

To understand how we got here with AMC, you need to look back further, to 2017. AMC has been struggling to be profitable for a while. They had a history of posting very small net profits along with many net losses. Their cash on hand was hovering around $300M and their corporate borrowing had been going up.

[Trying to hard to not lose money.](https://preview.redd.it/g7zugy792ue61.png?width=1876&format=png&auto=webp&s=f580cf12bad13197ed1426466d8b183a4191933e)

[Surely borrowing will make this problem go away!](https://preview.redd.it/jtgjqlu92ue61.png?width=1876&format=png&auto=webp&s=93a8ac04fd426390354024ce016a2a08df36c79f)

What coincided with the first small naked short bet on AMC in June/July of 2019? Their cash on hand just dipped below $200M (from being stable around $300m). The last time that happened, AMC more than doubled its corporate loans. The short hedge funds smelled blood in the water.

The second bet, where the naked shorts doubled down occurred in November of 2019. What happened then? AMC Q3 earnings, which showed that cash on hand had dropped to a precipitous $100M. Bankruptcy was in sight for the hedge funds...

And then COVID hit. Their massive third wave bet was similar to GameStop, though slightly more delayed. Why? May 2020 was the peak of naked short selling, around the time when some businesses were able to reopen with restrictions, but it was clear that **movie theaters**, among a few other things, would be staying closed until the pandemic was completely over.

Also like GameStop, at its peak **over 20% of the company's outstanding shares were failing to deliver**. This is not normal.

# Conclusion

I think the evidence shows there is a strong reason to believe that one or more hedge funds, probably in collusion with broker dealers or the DTCC, have been deliberately naked short selling both GME and AMC since mid-2019. They made small bets to start with in the first wave, doubled down a few months later, but stupidly went all-in for the kill when COVID hit the US. It presented a unique scapegoat that nobody would question for pushing a failing mall retailer and a dwindling movie chain out of business.

Where does this leave us? I don't know. Unless this results in some kind of economic crisis (and I'm beginning to think it will), I don't see anything getting seriously investigated or changing. This is the same crap that happened with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008, but nobody was went to jail for it. Of course they were going to keep doing it.

**This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and paste.**

Positions: 100 GME @ $36, 500 AMC @ $2.75 (but I wrote $3 calls before it mooned... GUH)

After what happened with gamestop, I'm convinced that this shit really might work out. On the other hand there are a lot of people thinking that this is just something to draw attention away from GME and withdraw fund from the stock. Let me assure you this is not my attention. And if you're all about GME I suggest reading here because it's a waste of time.

I personally think that slv really might be the next big thing that could work out. Therefore I'd suggest to not go against the idea generally. Keep your hands at gamestop as long as you want, but once work is done, get together into this next big thing.

\*\*Here's what happens or might happen:\*\*About the theory of the silversqueeze. Can't really be compared to the GME squeeze as it is not about squeezing out hedgefunds shortsellers in particular. The idea is that the silver price is priced way too low for the amount of silver that physically exists. The silvermarket volume on paper (exchanges/Futures..) is 250 times bigger than the supply of physical silver (just read this and didn't do my own DD if numbers are correct). The Idea is that a physical shortage will be caused and this would really let slv skyrocket with all that derivatives that are not backed. Now imagine some 7 million apes and the following retail investors that come after suddenly plunger the physical silver market...

Example: Let's assume there is a shortage and Person A wants physical delivery of the future he bought. Person B as the seller needs to deliver 5000 ounces of silver. If supply is short, the person buys another future from Person C in order to be able to deliver the slv needed. You understand the reaction this causes.

Also the silver market is said to be manipulated and kept low for a long time. I have no opinion on this.

\*\*What happened on the weekend?\*\*Silver already surged 20% since friday morning which was most likely a result of the news of ""Wallstreetbets taking over silver"" and ""Shortage in silver supply"".example: [https://twitter.com/bitpanda/status/1356023060814585859](https://twitter.com/bitpanda/status/1356023060814585859)Also I noticed several locals stores and online stores being sold out completely on silver and it looks like this is not only regarding a few small dealers.[https://www.theepochtimes.com/reddit-forum-sparks-physical-silver-shortage-on-major-dealers-websites\_3679079.html](https://www.theepochtimes.com/reddit-forum-sparks-physical-silver-shortage-on-major-dealers-websites_3679079.html)Also social media generates a lot of heat.

So it look's like it's happening - if we're heading to a global shortage, prices could absolutely go to the moon and this is a big time chance to be with it at the beginning right now. Additionally there is a good chance that shortsellers have learnt from what was happening with GME and they might get out of their short positions earlier which will generate further momentum.

**What you can do** in order to participate and make this work:It does not help the cause if you buy mining companys (even though it might generate good income). But still, in order moon the prices, you'll need to invest physically. The options are:\* Buying silver futures and let it physically deliver. Only possible if you can easily invest some 150k.\* Buying slv or pslv if you live at the hamburgers, and for instance ""Xtrackers physical silber"" if you're from Europe. It's really important that you check if the fund needs to fully physically cover it's assets (=buy silver). Because not all do so.\* The next option is to physically buy silver at your local store or webshop.\* At last, you can buy options. Your counterpart might want to hedge the positions and therefore will potentially be covered. This is also obviously the part where you can win big time (or lose everything). My weapon of choice is:  34.00C expiring in April

I prefer a mix of above.

But as we all know, I'm just another ape sharing brainfarts, hence I'm definitely not in the position to give financial advice. Also I'm long on slv, silver options and bought the silver of some local shops.

TL;DR:This post is **NOT about GME**. No selly selly - I get the hype! But silver might be one of the best chances for the upcoming weeks I believe. And today it's still a chance to get in early at low prices.

e/okay, guess we have to wait until GME is through. Looks like most in here aren't open for a new relationsship. Anything that's not GME/AMC gets downvoted to hell. ITT: People with weak hands scared of any funds going from gme to slv - this is ridiculous.

I spent the weekend looking for good opportunities to flip wall street. I set out looking for stocks that have good technicals to pull off a GME style short squeeze. I think DMC Global Inc, trading as BOOM (yep, that really is the ticker), is our best play. Here is why.

To find a play, I am looking for companies that are way over shorted, that aren’t too big and that could be squeezed by a WSB onslaught. I looked for these things:

1. Stock where there is **more than 100% institutional hold**, which indicates naked short selling
2. Stock where there is **more than 15% of float that is openly shorted**, these are shares that have been borrowed and shorted.
3. Stock with a **reasonable market cap** so we can move it, smaller is better here.
4. Any other factors revealed by a review of the company.

I am not an investment advisor and I am not giving any investment advice. #DYOR I have an MBA and know how markets work. I’m a geek who got into coding and finance in high school and working and investing for more than 20 years. I bought my first Jag with investment gains and people asked if I was old enough to drive it! I also got screwed over multiple times by banks and institutional investors. In 2008, I lost 3 years of my hard work investing when a broker closed out some of my positions at the worst possible crashing moment (to protect me!) and left me holding a bag of shit. I watched my broker front run my trades. When started with OTC, I saw them settle their prop desk’s least favorable trades of the day to me. Robinhood didn’t invent this stuff. If you’re in this to change Wall Street, let’s break their trades and take back the markets.

First, I think targeting companies like Nokia is a bad idea. **NOK has a market cap of 25.6 billion and not enough shorts on it. It will be very hard to move such a monster. BB is another case with few shorts and almost 9bil mkt cap.** AMC with a cap of 4.5 billion is already a challenge. GME was around 2 billion when we started this and it’s 22 billion now - very hard to hold at this level. We have to ask: **“How big is this challenge - a mountain or a boulder?” and “Who’s on the other side of  the trade and how deep?”** Keep these questions in mind before we move.

Secondly, **this is not long term investing** \- we are playing a hard game vs. wall street. It’s about momentum and trade positions. Company data doesn’t matter: EPS, EBITDA, cash flow - it doesn’t matter for a short squeeze trade. With GME, we have given the company a great opportunity to raise funds and pivot, but its future depends on management. We bankrupted Melvin. That is our achievement. Our goal is hitting the crooks on the other side of these trades: Citadel, SAC, Robinhood, etc. The company is just the football in this game.

Two interesting companies are Teradata Corp and Allogene Therapeutics Inc. These are short squeeze opportunities as well. TDC, has a 105.98% institutional and a 19.46% short interest with a cap of 2.9billion. TDC is almost 4x bigger than BOOM, so it will be harder to move with lower beta and a lower institutional so moves will have less impact. ALLO, has a 61.46% institutional and a 19.52% short interest with a cap of 4.9billion. Price action is not aggressive either but Allogen 8x bigger than BOOM and could be much harder to move.

After looking at these and several other candidates, I found the best option, one that I believe could be successful in less than 3 days. It is DMC Global Inc. (NASDAQ:BOOM)

1. **DMC has 114.49% institutional hold** \- this means that there are hedge funds that have big short positions on this stock, many of which are naked. Naked shorts create the phantom shares representing 15% more than the float. Naked short is when you short the stock and the lender who let you short sell the stock actually didn’t deliver the stock to you. This creates phantom shares. *Let me say that again:* there are 115% of the issued shares in play, that extra 15% in play *does not exist, but is owed*. These shares have been short sold without actually having shares to sell.
2. **DMC has 17.46% Short Interest**, so pretty heavily shorted. This means that pushing the stock up will squeeze that like a big zit on a small face.  This is way bigger % than NOK and BB who have a little zit on a big face.
3. **The market cap is just around 1 billion**. It won’t take huge volume to squeeze this one.
4. Other interesting features are a) **beta of 1.3**. The stock historically moves more than the market and b) recent price moves are up, but the **stock hasn’t had any crazy big run**, so there is a lot of room to push this up really fast. c) fyi: DMC has a real business manufacturing metal parts and accessories using explosives for the energy industry,
5. **It trades under ticker BOOM. This is a poetic bonus for this story.**

After looking at these and lots of others. I concluded that the best play is BOOM, it’s just like a ripe cherry waiting to be picked. I can find no better chance of success than this: a perfectly sized company that is as leveraged and as owned by hedgies as this. **I put this out for everyone and let the WSB mods decide.** The situation won’t stay like this for long in these volatile markets, so if we decide to act, it must be now. Let’s make this week another one for the history books. This is our moment. Let’s change the world, one BOOM at a time!

It is a revolution! It is regular people against the establishment. It's the unemployed bankrupting hedgefunds. Throw away your old valuations and look at this new. This is a movement....and there's fucking value in that!

How high can this go? This is where Ryan Cohen shines. We never know how far he will take this, but I know the dude is fucking brilliant. So fucking brilliant that I'm willing to give him my entire 401k to make this happen.

GameStop is no longer a retailer, it is a viral company. We need to value it like a viral company. Look at Dollar Shave Club. (Almost) everyone buys razors and doesn't give a shit where they come from. But DSC changed everything. People WANTED to buy razors from DSC. I believe we will WANT to buy from GameStop. Fuck, I love this company (and stock) so much, if GameStop starts selling razors, I will buy them.

Dollar Shave Club was sold to Unilever for $1billion when sales were around $100million ($200million projected). I believe GameStop has more value. They are going to increase sales 3x or 4x. They will increase their online presence and start selling more products. This is going to be huge. My valuation of GameStop is 15x current sales, or $1,398.85 per share and my target price is $2,797.70 within 2 years. 

The short squeeze will push this stock even higher, but for the long term the current price is a bargain.

I'M HOLDING THIS STOCK!

I know GameStop is a good retail company and I'm confident they will grow after this, but it is also personal. The criminals who paused my trades need to go to jail. When they get out, I want them to see a fucking GameStop store everywhere they go. Every shopping center, every mall, fucking everywhere! I want Gamestop to be bigger than Walmart. To do my part, I will buy everything from Gamestop. If they sell toiletpaper, I'll fucking buy.

$300/share is a bargain.
Buy GME and hold

Not financial advice, do you own research
I eat crayons when no one is looking
HOLDING 150 GME @99 FOREVER!

AMD, yeah remember the company everyone seemingly forgot about despite posting huge growth consistently in 2020? Well they recently had earnings and suffered bigly along with most tech. Some highlights from their earnings:

* Record revenue for the year with $9.76 billion in revenue
* Q4 Revenue up 53% to $3.244 billion (also record quaterly revenue)
* Gross profit up 53% to $1.451 billion
* Net income up to $1.78 billion compared to $170 million a year ago
* EPS up 867% (yes that is right) to $1.45 per share
* Cash flow up to $554 million YoY
* Q1 2021 guidance: 3.2B in revenue (79% YoY) and 46% gross margin
* FY'2021 guidance: 37% increase in revenue YoY
* Lets not forget their recent acquisition of Xilinx that will put them in a great position for the future

Also in light of the diversion and fake news tactics we can now observe, e. g. concerning silver, all data has to be regarded with caution.

Short positions have to be filed officially but with some delay. The last official update is from January 15th, 2021 and showed around 123% of GME float shorted. In the meantime, market intelligence firms provide reports about estimated short interest, which they sell as a product along with news and analytics services. Among these firms are IHS Markit Ltd. and S3 Partners.

According to Markit, short interest is now about 39%, S3 Partners states around 50%. Both values would be well elevated compared to the rest of the market. We also don't know to what extent these alleged numbers include new short positions at higher prices.

However, since the enormous short percentage of GME and the extreme increase in price, it can be argued that the short squeeze is not over and will continue, if the stock price stays elevated.

The short squeeze will only be over, if the shortsellers have abandoned old positions and are comfortable in new positions, if the intend to open them.

GME's stock price over time is one of the deciding factors here. If the price moves in favour of shorts still holding their positions, the may decide not to close them. If price stays elevated, additional shortsellers may need to close their positions, sending the price up.

\#Edit 1: For anybody criticizing this post: the percentages are, regardless if the allegedly came down, extreme numbers. It is logical that the massive increase in share price came due to some positions being closed and therefore Hedge Funds suffering. But the shorts are still in and that is why they use all their foul play. Someone on here recently deducted how high the percentage of retail holders could be. It was estimated 10 shares per user. The float is only 50m. The big squeeze is not off the table. Don't jump to conclusions because my post doesn't contain rockets and so forth.

BUY THE FUCKING DIP. THEY'RE PUNISHING THE RETARDS THAT HELD CALLS TO EXPIRY WITHOUT ALSO HOLDING ENOUGH MONEY FOR THE SHARES.




**TL;DR**
>Not investment advice. Market goes up and down, I think GME will go up. But this is to protect the true retards that held FDs through to expiry on a low budget account.

>They could potentially do a short attack to lower the prices enough that brokers margin call the owners of ITM calls on Monday. You can short the float for 100 shares, essentially making yourself delta neutral to protect yourself, then you get rid of them both on open with full gains.

Price is down $20 AH so be prepared for the morning dip. More scare tactics.

So, if institutional investors want to punish the retail investors they need to do it in a way that the retail investors have trouble countering.

In most cases, they would try to get the strike to where a majority of the open options positions would expire just under the strike with the most interest to keep people from having them executed and making money (in this case, the target would be <$320)

But my theory is, since there is a huge short interest, it's better for the big players to let GME finish above 320 which causes the largest open interest (300, 320) to all get auto-exercised.

Most retail traders don't know how to prevent the auto-exercise, so this causes a bunch of people to buy the stock at 300 and 320 (and various other strikes, under the 325 closing price)

Then they short the price down hard and buy to cover at the lower price in after-hours market, which has much less exposure to the retail investors. Right now the price is down to ~300.

This allows them to gain a profit of ~$20 right now on the execution of those 320s and potentially more, if the price continues to drop.

If the price actually tanks well below 300, this will additionally trigger margin calls Monday morning on the people assigned the shares at 320 and generate maximum profit for the short sellers.

It's too early to determine if this will happen since it would require a hell of a sell-off, but there is clearly an absolute ton of pressure to lower the price after hours to punish those who were holding 300 and 320 calls.

To give a more concrete example of how to manipulate the price:

HF buys GME when it dipped under $150.

HF sells GME 320 calls after it goes back up, for $$$$

Market pins GME at 325 at expiry, forcing auto assignment of 320s

Instead of allowing the cheap GME to be called away, they force the price down after hours.

They buy shares to cover their short calls at a discount, since they will get $320 for them.

Price was bouncing pretty hard between 300-320, but creeping back over 320 now. Should be quite interesting to see if it holds.

I like this options play because the spread for options dated two years out is really tight. I understand this is because the volatility is low and the chances of Ford hitting that price are remote but I'd gander that's in the absence of new information about an all electric lineup.

------------------

We were expecting a short ladder attack. It has happened every day since Wednesday 1/27.

We fucking won last week. We made all calls between 115 and 320 strike expire in the money. That means MM has to buy shares in order to hedge against those expired ITM calls.

That can happened anytime TODAY or TOMORROW.

They're driving the price down to get a deal.

## again, I repeat;  **MMs have until TOMORROW to buy shares from expired 1/29 ITM calls**. 

## They can buy them anytime TODAY or TOMORROW.

There is a VERY real situation on the available PHYSICAL silver you can buy. The stock SLV is so trash, it doesn't even keep up with Physical silvers price.

TD Precious Metals has been down for 2 days. Online stores are VERY low on stock.

>In response to the rapidly-evolving COVID-19 situation, the TD Precious Metals digital store is currently unavailable, but please check back later. Thank you for your patience

Locally you could call up your silver dealers and a lot of them are simply NOT SELLING! It's WILD. Just think, about this idea. let it ponder. Back in the day, 1 oz of silver = 1 dollar. If 1 OZ of silver was worth even 1% of our monetary system it would equal 2 MILLION DOLLARS an OUNCE!

Buying silver right now is insurance you have for THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. You really can't go wrong.

If even 6M people (IN THE WHOLE WORLD) bought 1500 worth of physical silver, the shortage would be SO GREAT, the price would increase over 1,000 / oz.

>**Constraints in Supply**Why can’t we just mine more silver? The reason we cannot “fix” the problem by mining more silver is the cost. Today for example, to mine gold, it takes $350 \[to $450\] to mine, refine, and bring to market one ounce of the yellow metal. With gold trading around \[$1200\] an ounce, that is a profitable endeavor. Silver however, is mined \[primarily\] as a by-product. In order to mine one ounce of silver as a primary metal, the cost associated with it is similar to the cost of mining one ounce of gold and with silver trading around \[$17 – $18\] an ounce and would not even be close to profitable when the mining costs are factored in. Currently we mine around six hundred million ounces of silver each year while industry consumes about eight hundred and seventy million ounces. Can you see a disparity developing? The market is tightening.

***TL;DR Read the constraints in supply, and this -> 130% of YEARLY silver harvested, is used in Industry!!***

I hope the boomers who say we can't do our own research will shut up now, even if I know they say stuff like this just because they lost big.

* Something important I want to had about the fundamentals of the company: with the buzz that GameStop have made, there is a real chance that its sales with perform better than expected. No valuation models, as far as I know, accounts for this because it's very difficult to price in.

Post will be updated with more answers and questions from the comments. This will help a lot of people!

#**Q1) The short float % seems to be going down from a number of sources. Why are these not correct?**

Responses:

- From u/kevinjing11: Short float % is what's publicly reported. Many ways that MMs and hedge funds can essentially fake this number through unreported phantom shares
- From u/Candle-Sticks: The short float % numbers we've been seeing are all estimates. The official reports don't come out until 2/9.
- From u/JesusHimself69: There's no way the hedges could have paid out their shorts that fast without the stocks rocketing up. Some on Thursday/Friday? Sure. But not over the weekend. It's just a scare tactic.

- From u/ whateverathrowaway00: 
http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html and 
https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf
The documents listed here show that the DTC ( central clearing house for stock trading ) has allowed counterfeit stock trading to occur for a long time. It is this environment that allows naked shorting to occur.
The SEC article above is from 2008 basically laying out how the restrictions put in place could be side stepped and it lines up. With this explanation, no one needed to call the DTC. There are no more shares of GME... period. That’s why even though short interest is being manipulated exactly as spelled out in the SEC paper above, there are no available shares to short in most brokers. The DTC raised deposit prices. They didn’t need a phone call. They’re not doing it to help any brokerages or hedge funds. They’re doing it to save their own ass. This is an opaque company that has the ability to shrug off congressional subpoenas. Independant actors all acting for their own gain is a much more likely explanation then widespread collusion. This is what makes sense to me. DTC raised deposits, allowing the shorts to unwind over time. The media will vilify the brokerages and hedge funds and no-one will ever ask where all the shares are. If that tactic does not work they will crash the economy in response.


#**Q2) Can't the hedge funds just keep doing more short ladder attacks and drive the price down?**

Responses: 

- From u/FudgieThaWhale: No, because they're losing money doing ladders in an attempt to acquire additional shares. If investors don't sell a dip then they just flat lose the money. They won't keep doing it because they can't.
- From u/Candle-Sticks: The ladder attacks rely on the HF holding shares, they can keep selling and laddering until they run out of shares. Of course they can easily buy more at the dips they artificially create.
- From u/storyhungry: Interactive Brokers currently says that the borrow rate is 16.97% for HFs


#**Q3) All these hedge funds are saying they're out of their short positions to align with question #1, we obviously don't believe them and they're probably racking up a ton of fees. How long can they really last?**

Responses:

- From u/FudgieThaWhale: It can last as long as they want to pay margin fees. I imagine that won't be for very long.

- From u/autodrafter2020: There is a massive amount of Failure to Deliver, and short sellers have to pay the clearing houses soon, it could be just days: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

#**Q4) When the short squeeze happens, what period of time are we talking about? Does it last 10 mins, 2 days, etc?**


#**Q5) How do I know if it's a short ladder attack?**

Responses:

- Click and read through this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7bhj/gme_mms_have_until_tomorrow_22_to_buy_shares_it/glmatag?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3


#**Q6)  What % of the float do we need to own before this starts to squeeze (and is this publicly available)?**

Responses: 

- From u/thejewsdidnothing :It is possible (and likely imo) that we already hold over 100% of GME’s float. Why haven’t we squeezed? Because the shorts are able to dilute the float with fake shares as much as they want. The real question that should be asked then is “at what point does the government step in to stop them, or when do the shorts accrue such heavy losses that they have to cover?” The answer is that we don’t know, but it’s only a matter of time.

#**Q7)  Why can't I buy more on Vanguard (relevant to other brokers too)**

Responses: 

- From u/Tainthairtwizzler : Vanguard no longer allowing you to use money transferred immediately. Just got off the phone with support and the funds need to be cleared through the 7 Day Hold before you can spend them. Must have been set over the weekend/today because I was able to buy BB from the same account but wasn't allowed to buy GME all during this morning.

#**Q8) Isn’t it plausible that HF have been shorting at 300- 400$ level and are now taking in big time on their own ladder attacks to around the 250$ level?**

Responses: 

- From u/Thefsm93: It is possible that they have been shorting at 300-400, except that the volume of shares being traded doesn't match the volume of shares needed for the short. If the question is more geared at them buying in at 300-400 and trying to short at 250, that would just make this situation worse because they would still then need to BUY.
Plus, why would they be artificially driving the price down with ladder attacks?

#**Q9)  How does the short % of the float matter if there are approximately 10M shares to cover with?**

#**Q10) (from others) I’m trying to get into the gme/amc craze but public / webull apps is taking anywhere between 1-7 days to confirm deposits before i can use the funds in my bank account. is this new? is there a way to expedite the process?**

Responses: 

- From u/waqas961: If you have a cash account linked to your bank on webull and you transfer an amount it will be available same day if did in morning or available next day as provisional funds to trade with until your actual deposit goes through which can take upto 5 days. I bought on 27th and 28th Jan but my actual deposits still show pending. Wire transfer however is different and for that you need to actually wait the whole time till it gets processed.
- From u/sutsusame: If you want to invest money right away, see if the brokerage will let you do a wire transfer. I use E*TRADE and incoming wire transfers usually clear within minutes, with no hold period. You will probably need to pay a fee to your bank.

#**Q11) What are some in depth posts that people believe should be read?**

- An insane amount of deception has been in the works for a long time: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

#**Q12) I've read a couple of posts that casually mention the possibility that GameStop could issue more shares, pulling in a bunch of money and essentially letting the shorts off the hook. Can GameStop do that? If so, why the hell wouldn’t they?**


#**Q13) What happens if HFs have artificially created the counterfeit shares to the amount we hold which they exactly need and then when the short squeeze takes place, restrict all of us 🦍 and basically resell it to themselves and make our shares burn to the ground?**


#**Q14) What happens if the short squeeze takes place and all of the brokerage houses crash, as we have seen they have restricted us from buying? Wouldn’t be surprised of seeing them not allowing us to sell at the most important moment. Btw, as we see that there is an insane amount of counterfeit shares, does that mean that this is hope they will save their asses by restricting the fake shares to be sold?**

I really want this to be helpful for everyone. If you are an expert or have other questions for me to ask, please comment and I will update this post. 

Holding 10 GME shares from $90/share. Got another one on Friday at $320 a share. I can't buy anymore but wish i could!

Citadel has a stake in SLV.
2. If we buy SLV and spike it up, Citadel will sell SLV to fund their GME cover which at this point they aren't able to hence the ladder attacks.
3. HFs like citadel know how market psychology works -that people are always ready to chase the next best thing so that's how they are peddling SLV along mainstream media to divert funds from GME to SLV.
4. What happens when Citadel sells off SLV - SLV will tank and you as a retail investor will lose money.
5. What happens if we buy GME - they are forced to cover, it moons, we as retail investors win.
6. What about AMC, BB,NOK - I personally believe in all 3 but I am long . BB has a contact with amazon and chinese EV manufacturer and has earnings soon.  NOK is the only 5G play along with Ericsson, AMC - vaccines are out and people have cabin fever, going to the movies is cultural and AMC is out of debt.

Hi all! I believe the marijuana industry presents unique growth opportunity through legislative change. Here’s why I am long the sector and eyeing options..

Last week, Chuck Schumer accounced that Marijuana Reform Bills are being merged as Congress moves to legalize.

This is massive news, in fact, Stifel is calling this a Goldilocks Scenario for companies like Tilray.

>This could potentially foreshadow the most significant catalyst in the history of the U.S. cannabis industry

The ~~Roaring~~ Rolling 2020s 'Will Be Fueled By Weed' As Cannabis Experts Predict Regulatory Shakeups In 2021

>2021 should be a year of ongoing regulatory movement; expecting 2022 to mark the biggest wave the reform movement has seen so far

The marijuana industry is a beaten down industry with banking restrictions &amp; short interest through the roof. 

US Legalization is just around the corner and no one is talking about it. 

I strongly encourage everyone to research some companies and potentially get in before the media gets ahold of this story.

Here are a list of cannabis related companies you can look into with options:

Aphria, Tilray, Canopy Growth, Organigram, Aurora, HEXO

(Many MSOs still trade on the OTC, but will be pushing to uplist in the near future. Keep an eye on Curaleaf, Trulieve, Cresco Labs & Green Thumb)

There are also ETFs available with US exposure such as $MSOS

Also, it is important to deepdive the management in this industry, as it is with any other. A good management with tegrity goes a long way. I won’t go into detail, but, we’ve seen behind some curtains(walls) and it wasn’t pretty.

Politico said ‘There’s no stopping the industry now’: Democratic control is a big win for marijuana 

Stay safe & GLTA!

I am eyeing APHA 1/20/23 20 Cs @ 4.20 (currently long)

Check out that bullflag forming on the monthly.

Edit: Here’s a list of other cannabis related companies... Verano, Acreage, TerrAscend, Harvest Health & Rec, 4Front, Columbia Care, Sundial, Planet 13, GrowGeneration, Jushi, Vireo, Village Farms, Cronos

\*\*\*

[REMX](https://www.vaneck.com/etf/equity/remx/holdings/) is a Rare Earth Metals ETF that gives any portfolio broad exposure to all major rare earth metal miners and players in China, Australia and some more (e.g US including Lithium Americas and Livent).

This saves one from the hassle of trying to track individual Chinese or Australian RE mining / metal extraction companies while giving access to an industry that will be a key supplier to the EV market in China and abroad. The output of these companies is also critical for the renewable energy (wind) sector and electronics to a certain extent.

For all the talk of the US bringing back supply chains (or relying on MP materials), this is one sector that cannot be brought back in the immediate to short term. The ETF hit highs of 92 in Jan 2018 and I expect that in a high liquidity environment with policy emphasis on electrification it will touch and exceed those levels. The ATH of 2011 is 300+ but I am not sure how relevant that might be today (but is a technical indication of the last time we had a media driven rare earth metals craze).

In summary

\- If you are not sure which Rare Earth mining company to pick or you want exposure to the EV secular shift but are not sure which SPAC or EV maker will go to the moon, consider REMX (rare earth metals ETF)  
\- Solid performer over the last months, currently going through a pullback (83 to 75)  
\- Moves slow but steady and has strong tailwinds  
\- Not super volatile so easier to get out of if you find a new shiny thing  
\- OTM calls are cheap  
\- Most recent high within the last 2 years was 92

Full disclosure: I have one deep ITM call for Aug 2021 and some shares (small account holder). The ETF has done nicely for me over the last few months (got in at 40), and this current pullback might be a good time to buy."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082633.csv|DueDiligence|['REMX', 'EV']|[]|['DD', 'I', 'ETF', 'US', 'RE', 'EV', 'US', 'MP', 'ETF', 'I', 'ATH', 'I', 'EV', 'SPAC', 'EV', 'REMX', 'OTM', 'I', 'ITM', 'ETF']|[]

You can and should read the actual source which is linked in the article if you want even more detail. Great way to learn more about the underground bullshit funds have been getting away with for far too long.

In summary:

A consortium of hedge funds get together and plan a short attack by selling and buying counterfeit shares at lower and lower prices, driving the bid/ask artificially. With the disclosed short positions and the counterfeited shares, the true price of a stock can be manipulated much further than it should realistically should go. If the short attack meets resistance on the long side, they flood the market with their reserve of ""strategic fails–to–deliver"" shares and overwhelm demand. Usually they do these big attacks on big news days so that their fake volume is masked. But now, with GME, nobody is selling so all their action is out in the open!

They utilize '**Media Assaults**' which we have seen nonstop the past week with CNBC reporting 'sHorTs hAvE coVeReD' and now every outlet reporting on silver. It's all fake and these news outlets are in bed with the HFs. We've seen this evolve over the years to the social media bot attacks and disinformation campaigns. I'm sure the mods can attest to the thousands of bots they ban daily. I certainly saw them first hand in the Discord, promoting silver and other BS distractions.

There is a criminal **lack of transparency** surrounding short positions and the prime brokers, DTC, hedge funds all benefit. The SEC looks the other way because they are unfunded, powerless, and let's face it: they exist to protect big money.

**What can we do?** These events with GME and others have put these illegal and corrupts acts in the eyes of the public around the globe. The pressure needs to stay on these actions until something changes. The public should continue to voice their concerns to members of our government and push for more transparency and regulation against these outright malicious acts.

In the mean time, everyone should realize these ladder attacks are fake outs and are driven by miniscule volume. Everyone is, and should continue to HOLD (duh).

The article states that these short attacks are >90% successful. Well, looks like they fucked up big time by betting the farm and landing a critical miss.

HODOR THAT SHIT!

I got a lot of messages after my last post asking for thoughts of the big four, and BB is one that sticks out to me as having high value long term and not just through this current bonanza. 

Many of you have been seeing this ticker posted a few times called BB (blackberry for the less imaginative readers). Now, I am sure many of you new-comers to this sub probably are thinking “What in tarnation? This phone company still exists?” 

Yes. And the kicker? **BB is no longer a phone company**

In case you missed the news, BB is selling their phone stuff and going balls deep into automotive software. Not just any cars, but autonomous and EV. Every WSB autist’s wet dream.  I mean AI and EV in one company? No way this can go tits up!

If you look at older posts in WSB, you will see that BB was getting attention here for a while before the the current madness and many had high hopes that BB could rain in tendies in the near future. I am sure there are many here that have BB for under 10, which are probably the people who saw this potential. 

BB is selling away their phone patents to Huawei and partnering with Baidu (amongst other companies) to work on their autonomous driving technology. Specifically, BB’s operating system will be incorporated to be the backbone of Baidu’s autonomous driving platform. 

The news does not stop with Baidu. This is merely one example of BB’s expanding influence over autonomous driving, navigation, vehicle health protection, and vehicle security. At this point a simple google search with the words Blackberry + vehicle will net you dozens of results for projects they are working on and leading in the automotive software industry. 

All in all, I am very bullish on BB, especially long term.  What this all boils down to is if you think you’ve missed the boat on the big 4, BB may still be a good choice to jump in. Even if it pulls back, BB probably won’t leave you bag holding for long. 

Good luck all and may the tendies be with you.

Do you realize reddit has a search function? Here is a list of posts that talk about a potential silver squeeze of SLV and JPM long, long, long before GME blasted off towards the moon. This is /r/wallstreetbets, not /r/GME. We trade multiple tickers, you dumbshit fucking ""entry at $450"" bag holding tards.

Great, you joined in the last 2 weeks because your autistic nephew made more money in 2 months than you've ever done.

Instead of just shutting up and watching the plethora of good DD posts rise and fall, you think this entire subreddit is only about holding one frickin' short squeeze as if that's the first time in history anyone got squoze, and downvote otherwise great research because you're frickin' terrified of losing money you couldn't afford to lose in the first place.

The entire global media didn't all pool together in 48 hours to present a uniform story of ""buy silver"" as part of some frickin' conspiracy designed to save a few medium-sized American hedge funds. No more than COVID was made by the Chinese to win Biden the presidency, anyway.

So here, since you guys are too damn handicapped to use a fucking search engine, are a list of DD/YOLO/Discussion posts about SLV and Silver written LONG BEFORE THE FUCKING GME SHORT SQUEEZE FINALLY ROCKETED!!! Jesus fuck, you tinfoil wearing sack of ""fake news"" American mouth-breathers with the collective IQ of a doorknob.

Just look at the fucking DD and pretend GME doesn't exist for 5 minutes. Silver. Is. A. Deep. Fucking. Value. Play! It has value. So much fucking deep value! 

Yeah, no shit a market maker is holding silver positions when silver becomes more sought after, their job is to make fucking markets liquid. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SUPPLY LIQUIDITY IF YOU DON'T HAVE SHIT TO SUPPLY?! DID YOU NOTICE HOW THEY HAVE A LOT OF PUTS AND A LOT OF CALLS, AND NOT JUST CALLS?!

DO YOU THINK NO BILLIONAIRES HELPED RIDE GME UP? Do you think it was 100% retail on one side and 100% Melvin and Citron on the other? Ah, you do. Of course, you do.  


GREAT, WE GOT 8 MILLION DEGENERATES HERE. The 6M that didn't manage to find this place without hearing about GME having rocketed already, MAYBE DON'T FUCKING POST, COMMENT AND BRING YOUR DAMN IGNORANCE INTO A SUB THAT WAS ACTUALLY PROVIDING 2-10 DECENT TRADE IDEAS PER WEEK PRIOR TO THIS CULT FUCKING INFESTATION OF JACKASSES COSPLAYING RETARDS.

Whatever, here's a list none of you fuckers are capable of reading:

\- 5 months ago, /u/negovany wrote ""[Cornering Silver Market](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/idjk61/cornering_silver_market/)"". The whole thing is about JPM and squeezing silver. $GME was at $5 back then and /u/DeepFuckingValue was still getting laughed at for buying at every opportunity. Rest of you fuckers had barely gotten over the last cult following, PRPL mattresses.  
\- 6 months ago, /u/lucasandrew talks about ""[Why you should trade futures - WSB Edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i3qkex/why_you_should_trade_futures_wsb_edition/)"", in which he mentions ""*Speaking of SLV, people have been posting all the reasons that JPM fucks with the SLV ETF*"". Yeah, I bet he took a fucking time-machine back 6 months in time after Citadel got stuck in the boo-boo. 

\- 6 months ago, /u/LE0TARD0 implores the ""[SILVER CHAD'S RISE UP!](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hy7nvn/silver_chads_rise_up/)"". A straight fundamental thread on why silver is undervalued, not mention JPM. However, in the comments, a thread is started by /u/kbtech18 and supplemented by /u/ayyayyron talking about precisely JPM and their price manipulation of silver. YEAH, NO THAT NEVER HAPPENED, I'M SORRY FOR BEING A SHILL, LIKE FUCKING TAKE YOUR TINFOIL HATS OFF YOU DUMB SHITS!

\- 5 months ago, /u/Fuzzers wrote ""[September Silver Futures Contact - Something Aint Right Kids](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9b1th/september_silver_futures_contact_something_aint/)"".  
After hailing his fellow degenerates, HE IMMEDIATELY SAYS: ""*I know there has been 6 billion posts about silver,""* before later writing ""*A large amount of contracts will stand for delivery such as in July. If its enough, maybe some of the big banks who have short positions might find themselves in hot water with their silver delivery amounts."".* Isn't IT JUST GLORIOUS HOW MELVIN AND CITADEL HAVE ALL THESE TIME MACHINES TO MAKE UP IMAGINARY SILVER SQUEEZES 6 MONTHS BEFORE THEY WERE MADE UP? YOU GUYS ARE SO FUCKING DUMB RIGHT NOW, HOLY FUCK! DON'T INVEST IN SILVER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, BUT PLEASE STOP WITH THE AMERICAN FAKE NEWS CONSPIRACY THEORIES, IT HURTS MY ALREADY FUCKED UP BRAIN, STOP, I DON'T CONSENT!

\- 5 months ago (YOU GUYS, MAYBE YOU ARE RIGHT, ALL THE POSTS ARE FROM 5-6 MONTHS AGO, MAYBE IT REALLY IS A TIME TRAVELLING CONSPIRACY BY MELVIN AND CITADEL, YES, LET'S GO WITH THAT!), /u/jetter23, wrote ""[Weekend Update - Silver](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i6l0o2/weekend_update_silver/)"". What did he have to share, in terms of ideas and DD? "" *4a) Banks will continue to fight us on silver, but they are losing as they were massively short,*  "". WHAT SNEAKY FRICKIN' MARKET MANIPULATING HEDGE FUND SHILL HE IS, JUST GOING BACK SO FAR IN TIME TO SET US UP FOR THE PERFECT TRAP TO HELP CITADEL!!!

\- /u/jetter23 was quite active shilling 5 months ago, he also wrote ""[Weekend Update - Silver (DD#3)](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9uxok/weekend_update_silver_dd3/)"", where he just casually mentioned ""*JPM is currently under DOJ investigation AGAIN for price speculation on Silver. JPM is learning a VERY expensive lesson that when there is a pandemic, global FIAT currencies are crashing(like the DXY), and there is a run on physical metals - you can't be naked short on paper.""* IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE'S TALKING ABOUT SOME SORT OF SILVER SHORT SQUEEZE ON JPM, BUT HEY, THAT CAN'T BE IT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST A SCAM FAKE NEWS IDEA THAT'S 2-3 DAYS OLD, RIGHT? 

\- /u/CCJ_Moon_6969 popped his head into the stream of tachyons, relatively talking to us from the present all the way 6 months ago, when he wrote ""[Silver. $SLV call options. New York Comex.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hy8wv9/silver_slv_call_options_new_york_comex/)"". Do you remember /u/kbtech18 from a few threads up? WELL, GEE WHIZ, HE COVERED THAT TIME STREAM TOO, talking about JPM and silver. 6 months ago. I mean, today. Reddit probably changed the timestamps on the posts. DAMN SHILLS!  
\- /u/rawvi wrote ""[JPM and Silver](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i88cyy/jpm_and_silver/)"" 5 months ago, wanting to learn more about... time travel. Nothing to do with naked shorting of silver. BECAUSE THAT WASN'T EVER TALKED ABOUT ON THIS UNTIL 2 DAYS AGO, SO LIKE... HAH, HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ASKING ABOUT THAT, RIGHT?!?! CORPORATE SHILL BOT LOLOLOL!

WE LIKE THE STOCK!!!

$SOLO is currently only trading at $7.

Here’s my DD on why $SOLO is worth $400  🌖🚀🚀🚀 

According to my retardation Shitron Research is wrong on $GME (HTL) and $SOLO, which is actually a very solid long-term tendie. I’m including my positions below  🚘🚘🔋🔋🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

1. **SOLO is an undervalued and cheap EV stock 🚘🚘🚀🚀💎🙌**  
Electra Meccanica (NASAQ: SOLO) is a chad young EV company based in Vancouver, Canada, and is in process of producing affordable EV's: the Solo (a 3-wheel EV, costing $15k - I could haul all my stonks around in it, and a sports EV called the Tofino ($50k), and the fucking beauty ""eRoadster"" ($125k). They are producing several EVs simultaneously and have letters of intent for over 21,000 Solo purchases from various dealers worldwide, and recently started reservations for the eRoadster and Tofino. Their stock is currently trading at only $7 - basically making it a penny stock with a market cap of $628M. In my personal retarded opinion it's a *very* undervalued stock.  

2. **People don't think the 3-wheeled concept will be adopted ♿️♿️♿️**  
Nor did people think EV's could dominate ICE's. Or that TSLA could exceed the market cap of every other legacy automaker combined. But we autists knew we could. We retards knew we could. And look what happened. Now every autist is eating oven roasted tendies for brekky lunch and din. This company is trying to capture a unique segment of the EV market and is receiving heat from all sides, and that's exactly why SOLO is going to the mars to join lord musk.   

3. **SOLO is in a great cash position 💰**  
Great cash and investors. According to their Q3 results:   
*Cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits were CAD$101.1 million as of September 30, 2020, compared with CAD$11.1 million as of December 31, 2019.*   

4. **Citron 🐍 is shorting $GME and may go bankrupt soon - causing a short squeeze  🚀**   
When virgin Citron's attack on SOLO first came out in November, based on the headlines it seemed many people took the short thesis seriously. Obviously via recent events it was made very clear that Citron and the other Hedge Funds simply attack their short positions in a very dishonest way. If its short positions will be force-sold, this will force the stock to go higher 🚀🚀. Even though the floated short is only 15%, (not as high as $GME's >100%), a short squeeze can still very much be squozen.  

5. **Citron capitalized on the Nikola scandal to attack SOLO 🐍**  
The shorting attack happened shortly after the Nikola Motors & sus Trevor Milton scandal, which Citron mentioned in their reason for shorting the EV company. Don't compare a truck rolling down a fat hill led by a dysfunctional pedo guy to a canadian EV company (canadians don't lie).  

6. **SOLO has a $50k EV roadster in the works 🏎**  
In addition to the 3-wheel EVs, SOLO is developing a 50k electric sports roadster as one of their first vehicles, the Tofino. Having been a massive Tesla fan since 2014, this is really impressive to me, considering that Tesla's first ever EV was a mid-motor RWD Roadster which cost $98,000 in 2008 !!!  🏎🚀   
 
7. **Manufacturing experience and talent**  
SOLO's executive team is pretty impressive, the Founder and President Henry Reisner has a deep background in manufacturing. 🤖 They've partnered with major OEM's and have a manufacturing agreement with China's largest motorcycle manufacturer. Insider holdings for executive team are at 36.6% of the outstanding stock - they're in it for the long run 🚀🚀  

8. **I think I’m actually on the spectrum**   
Here's proof:

&#x200B;

$SOLO YOLO!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 $7 going to $400   


TL;DR: Citron Research is a dishonest Hedge Fund that shorted $GME and has $2 price target on SOLO, a Canada-based EV company in a great cash position and solid position for growth. Currently undervalued at $7, going to $400

This is what drove the shutting down of GME and other Reddit meme stock sales and avoided a complete meltdown last week.

There is a ton of conflicting information, market manipulation, and other bullshit out there.  We will not actually have reliable data that the shorts are covered until this is all over (real short data is only published every 2 weeks and is already 2 weeks old by the time of publication).  How the fuck do we keep our emotions in check in the mean time?

One thing is for sure, there is a MASSIVE effort to divert attention away from GME and other meme stocks going on right now.

If these guys were truly out, they wouldnt give a fuck and would just walk away with their money like they have for the last 10 years.  People dont spend A LOT of money trying to tell people what to think unless they have something to gain.

Ill be selling at $1000+ or when I havent heard SLV or GME on the news for a week.  Thats when well know this has changed from retail vs hedge fund to retail vs retail.

My monkey brain has been reading wsb far to long and I decided to put together a quick list of reasons why I think the squeeze will happen (or not, fuck you I lick doors), I sourced everything so that if you learn to read in the next little while you can give it a shot with those. This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor.

A) GME has been on the NYSE Threshold Securities List for over 35 days.  The streak of FTD (Failure to deliver) of shares continues. Where are the shares?

B) The last 3 trading days have had abnormally low volume. It's not coincidental that when the sentiment for $GME is at its all time high and price mooning, trading is/was being suppressed.  Last week was an obvious attack on retail investors ability to purchase shares and gatekeeping from upward momentum. An obvious tell that they would and did incur massive losses.

* Sentiment: [https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/wallstreetbets/ticker-sentiment](https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/wallstreetbets/ticker-sentiment)

C) Since then we've seen Short Ladder attacks everyday to force stop losses and paper hands in order to cover as much as they can. We saw on full display the perversion of MM's/HF's trying to fuck the average joe for their negligent behavior. We've recovered every time. This is an orchestrated attack. This could of ended long ago if they just covered.

D) Brokers no longer have shares to borrow for short sale.

E) Speculation that the shorts have been trading counterfeit shares, this isn't a unique situation and I wouldn't be surprised is this is happening. They could be trying to cover their tracks of this as well as prevent catastrophic losses.

F) The losses incurred should strengthen your convictions about the thesis of $GME.  Melvin needed to be bailed out, RH CEO lied publicly about liquidity and required a bailout today. I'm sure more will also be taking further losses in the days/weeks ahead. HOLD STRONG, they are trying to bait you through volatility, disinformation  and attrition/fatigue. We are gamers HOLD STRONG, consider this a time-gated mission before getting your legendary weapon.

G) The aggressive and blatant ramp-up of disinformation through media is immensely revealing. The billionaires are scared and getting their stooges to throw all the FUD at the wall to see what sticks, to ensure we don't hit the ""grand slam"" as Cramer put it. They are shilling silver (perfectr example), stating arrogantly that reddit is in on silver while out of GameStop ,or both (the swaggystocks sentiment tracker shows the complete opposite) and finally of course saying last week that the shorts are covering. Today's media was down right egregiously incorrect.

H) A large amount of January 29, 2020 calls (strike 115-325) finished itm. These shares will require fulfillment by tomorrow. This is a huge amount of obligated buying pressure.

I) Bloomberg terminal still showing over 120% SI. However there will be a clearer update of the short interest in the coming few days. I want to say the date is Feb. 9, 2020.  IMO shorts have not covered.

J) FINALLY, THERE IS ONLY ONE GME. NOTHING ELSE REPLICATES THE CONDITIONS. I LIKE THE STOCK AND RYAN COHEN. FUNDAMENTALLY I BELIEVE GME WILL REPLICATE CHEWY.  ALWAYS HAVE A TARGET BUT I'M HOLDING. THIS IS A WAR, WE CAN REMAIN RETARDED THAN THEY CAN REMAIN SOLVENT BUT THAT STILL MEANS IT TAKES TIME. DONT BE PAPER HANDED AND STAY RESOLUTE.

I believe that these 10 factors are converging and I'm holding.

I recommend you do it tomorrow at the open and grab LGND stock instead and here is why:

We always need a good reason for why we're investing. For the many who started sub $100 price point on GME, it was mostly because the short interest was through the roof at 140% when GME was at $5. That's fucking ridiculous. Because of that, there was strong potential for a short squeeze and a gamma squeeze even happened 1/22. Big applause to the retards who won that and drove the price of GME past $100.

Here is an example:  Melvin Capital closed their shorts on 1/26 when GME was at $148. If they were shorting since at least the start of January when it was at $17, then they lost $17 sold - $148 bought = $131 for each shorted stock they had. They bought at 148/17 = 8.7X how much they sold the stock for.

Ultimately, they motivated short holders to cover their position at a fat loss. However, shares short as a percentage of float still remained dummy high the same week. Why? Because new shorts came at higher price points of GME stock ($300+) than before. For those hedge fund institutions to be incentivized to cover their newer short position, GME would need to keep skyrocketing, at least into the $500 range to put pressure on their shorts at $300, and that isn't even 2x how much they sold the stock for. Remember, about 9X is when Melcin Capital finally threw in the towel.  If it does go that high and institutions do sell though, then they could  further carry it into who knows, maybe 1k+ where the moon awaits. Ok so if you're holding, goal is to get the stock to $500+ so that a short squeeze can happen. Remember, getting it to $500 won't happen because of a short squeeze.

This means that initial jump into a solid $500 stock price would need to be made mostly by retail investors, of which, have already invested into GME. Literally the WHOLE WORLD is on this boat including Europe and even China. Listen, if the hype was real enough to get global attention, that's the peak man! You're not gonna find more retail investors to jump onto the GME ship to carry it to $500+, there just isn't any more people. So, I don't think retail investors have the remaining capital to keep boosting GME stock price because its peaked its hype.

Still thinking GME has dummy high short interest and you don't care about what i've just said? Think again, more than half the shorts were covered Friday

What does this mean? If capital is all tied up and gme isn't moving up, people will sell. If they sell, you already know what that means... its over.

So to save my tendies and maybe yours, I'll be the first to say I sold my GME stock and moved it all into LGND. Wtf is LGND? Fuck if i know. But I do know (as far as my research goes) they're now THE MOST HEAVILY SHORTED COMPANY.

This was the whole reason why GME was a gem to begin with and it happened, that bitch mooned because we like the stock. But without the short position to help keep it bolstered, it doesn't have support like LGND does. The short position on LGND is at a super high 65% and most of those are from a month ago or before when the stock price was half. THIS MEANS THE SHORTS ARE PRIMED TO BE COVERED ALREADY! HOP THE FUCK IN BOYS. Positions = buy the damn stock.

TLDR; GME is dying. I like LGND stock better

&#x200B;

Edit: 🚀LGND🚀

To the many of you still thinking GME shorts are high AF and over 100%, thats because the information you're getting IS NOT UP TO DATE. The stock exchanges releases short interest data once every two weeks for the public to see. I paid to see data daily. GME short interest has declined sharply because shorts were covered. Here is a link to an article with a different graph than mine, same conclusion: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/gamestop-short-interest-plummets-in-a-sign-traders-are-covering](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/gamestop-short-interest-plummets-in-a-sign-traders-are-covering)

My claim is that another gap up this week is guaranteed if we hold $300.**

With GME pushed above $320 Friday, a huge wall of calls were exercised. Anyone who sold calls is now deeply, deeply underwater.

The longs haven’t won the battle yet though: holders of the short calls (largely Citadel at this point) have **two days** to deliver the shares. (See source below).

If I was in their position, would I start covering today  and therefore trigger a gamma squeeze? HECK NO. 

Instead, If I was a short, I would kick the can one more day while I try one more hail mary. I will attempt a large short-ladder attack to at least push the price down (if not outright induce panic-selling). At the same time, I would approach a large institution with shares (think Fidelity or Blackrock), and make an offer for a large volume of shares.

By pushing the price down, I can reduce my losses, and at the same time strengthen my hand in negotations with institutions that can offer shares.

If the hail mary works, shorts can at least get away alive tomorrow without even incurring “failure to deliver”

However, if retail is able to kill them at $300-$320 by open tomorrow, there will be a gamma squeeze the likes we have never seen this week (probably not THE squeeze yet, but a squeeze nonetheless). 

Panic-buying will start. Not all firms will do this panic buying, but I figure there are enough smaller HF shorts who don’t have a legal team to temporarily stonewall failure-to-deliver lawsuits. Those have no choice but to start covering.


**TLDR: no squeeze today because shorts still have one day of breathing room. Don’t just 💎✋🤲, BUY until we are at $300**

EDIT: 💎💎💎💎🤲🤲🤲 = 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

EDIT: for those asking for source on that GME is a physically-settled option: see this: The SEC only granted cash-settlement on a specific set of ETF tickers  (https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nyseamer/2020/34-88131.pdf)

For info on the T+2 settlement days on see page 9 of 42 (or 15/48 for whole document) of this: https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/filings/orgrules/17/06/rule061417occdco001.pdf

“Rule 903 governs the obligation of a Clearing Member to deliver when either a Delivery Advice or OCC directs that settlement be made on a broker-to-broker basis. It currently specifies the delivery date for physically-settled options as the third business day following the day on which the exercise notice was, or is deemed to have been, properly tendered to OCC. Rule 903 also generally specifies the delivery date for physically settled security futures as the third business day following the maturity date. Under the proposed rule change, these references in Rule 903 to the “third” business day would be changed to the “second” business day.”"|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'HECK', 'NO', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'THE', 'I', 'HF', 'BUY', 'GME', 'SEC', 'ETF', 'OCC', 'OCC']|['GME', 'GME']

First and foremost, I have 2,000 shares of GME which I first bought around \~$90 as I learned about the short squeeze thesis. I know I will get a ton of hate for this, but in full transparency, I will hold these until the price dips below my reservation price of $100, at which point I will likely dump to at least get my cost basis back. I am hopeful that this won’t happen anytime soon though.

I think what’s going on right now is a complicated game theory problem. I am still thinking through this so would very much appreciate any input from anyone that I may have missed.

**Actors:**

**The shorts**, which include the Melvins, the Citadels, and the Robinhoods. The Melvins represent all the hedge funds that are short the stock (Viking, D1, Maple Lane, etc.). The Citadels represent the market makers that have to take on a net short position to ensure liquidity and volume in the stock as the price rides up, and the Robinhoods represent the brokerages that have to post up increasing amounts of collateral to clearinghouses, as they are ultimately responsible for  losses in major downward movements in the stock (e.g., if someone buys GME at $500 on 100% margin, they in theory should be called when the stock dips to $250, but in the case of a couple trading days ago, we saw it go from $500 to $130 very quickly, making it difficult to liquidate the position on time and resulting in substantial losses for Robinhood).

**The longs**, which include institutions and retailers. Institutions are all the good guy funds like Blackrock, Maverick, Vanguard, etc. that are long the stock. The retailers are us. 

I think we all understand the situation in that shorts are in a world of hurt. If short interest truly is 100%+, and costs of borrowing skyrocket, there really is nothing shorts can do here. They will get squeezed and we will get our tendies. If. We. Just. All. Hold.

That being said, the difficult thing here is the lack of communication and transparency that works against us. I’d bet my left nut that Citadel is on the phone with Melvin, who’s on the phone with Maple Lane, who’s on the phone with Lone Pine coordinating every move, ensuring no one triggers the short squeeze. They’ve got more weapons in their arsenal as institutions to run things like ladder attacks which we all saw these past few days. Being on the long side, however, is a little more challenging. We need to have mutual trust across not just us, as retailers, which I think we have, but also with the long funds for which there is no open line of communication. There’s a chance that they could cash out their position for a solid gain with a willing short at a set price in an OTC deal. That would not affect the stock price but would dramatically reduce the short interest and leave us holding the bag at the end of the day. This is a very real risk that we need to have in the back of our minds.

The other wrinkle to this however, is that if a true infinite squeeze were to be achieved, all the short funds would go under. Robinhood would absolutely go under. And there’s a great chance Citadel would go under as well. While that’ll bring us tremendous amounts of joy, it would not bring Blackrock the same joy as their other holdings would surely come down quite dramatically.

I think the long funds have to understand this dynamic, and they’re clearly willing to play poker. They understand that there’s still squeeze to be squoze before reaching that catastrophic scenario outlined earlier, but as soon as it’s in their best interest to sell (before short funds and Citadel go under), they’ll get out. 

**My takeaway from all this is that there is still room to run here, which is why I’m still in, but diamond hands from all of us are needed and we need to proceed cautiously.** It’s an uphill battle to climb given our limited ability to buy stocks on certain brokerages and the shorts having an arsenal of weapons to use (including the Media), but if we have coordination amongst us, an unspoken coordination with long funds, and diamond hands, we should be able to rake in some tendies.

New-ish to the market. I get the concepts but haven't ever dove into the details / DD.

More of an observation + question to those that know more about this than me:

&#x200B;

DATA:

Trading volume of 1.1m

Outstanding shares of 102.27m

% Shorted = 88.58

&#x200B;

Does this mean that 88.58% of the 102.27m shares are shorted? \~90.6m?

At a volume of 1.1m/day, if the volume was 100% short-closing, that would take,  +/- 3 months for them to be able to close all these shorts, physically is that right?

&#x200B;

Not that I think it will take that long, I get that the options might expire way before that. I am just asking if, theoretically, these short positions couldn't even close at this volume for at least 3 months?

&#x200B;

Trying better to understand the data and how it all relates to each other

&#x200B;

Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member  of a national securities exchange -- **(2)**  To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, *a series of transactions* in any security registered on a national securities  exchange, any security not so registered, or *in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement* with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such  security, or **raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.""**

Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here

Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter, which can be investigated quite quickly, not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government.

Finally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that ""Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in  violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, **shall** be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price  which was affected by such act or transaction.""  


I am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest and is AGAINST THE LAW. You must act now before it is too late.

Sincerely,

Your Average Retail Investor

tl;dr

AMC is the global leader in a $17 billion dollar industry that’s been beaten senseless to the ground with so much room to run. After pioneering deals with streaming services, buying out their competition, and upgrading their facilities worldwide, 80% short interest is highly inappropriate for its TRUE fundamental value — $69.69 a share.

""I'm questioning whether they\[WSB\] are actually doing the research when it comes to things like GameStop and AMC ..."" *- clueless* [*CNBC dude*](https://youtu.be/DYZHtF-tV0k?t=97)*.*

I fuckin miss movies. And when I say movies, I mean the whole damn experience. I wanna buy my $15 popcorn, pour an ungodly amount of butter and jalapenos on that shit and munch in a recliner seat watching in laser 4k quality. I like this company. I like this stock.

For the past few days, I've been scouring Google for news articles and company data. I've also been trying to find some detailed DD in here but they’ve all been pretty limp-dick when it came to AMC. And most of the news articles I've read were surface-level AT BEST with a grim outlook based on first-glance analysis. Guess these analysts are just too damn lazy to dig deep.

Because when we dive into these issues, we can easily see that the theater giant may not be in as bad a situation as the media/analysts are claiming.

In fact, I believe that **AMC is absolutely misunderstood, overlooked, and** **undervalued.**

Here is why I am more confident than ever that $AMC will not only reach $30 but is in the perfect setup to see ATHs and WELL ABOVE.

# I. Ugly Start, Beautiful Setup

Chances are if you are currently holding a significant position in $AMC, then most likely you've already read up on the company and its current standing in the cinema industry. You've probably read about how the corporation has nearly [$5 billion dollars worth of debt](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/amc-could-benefit-from-bankruptcy-analysts-say.html) with many of its locations still closed as the pandemic remains a global issue. You may have realized that new movies haven't been coming out. But more than that, you're seeing that movies are just being[ released on streaming platforms](https://hbr.org/2021/01/will-movie-theaters-survive-when-audiences-can-stream-new-releases) anyway. You might be concerned for AMC, or even the industry as a whole.

All of these concerns are very valid and based on real uncertainty, but let's break down each of these points and see if they’re as bad as analysts claim.

# II. A Discussion on Debt

Media outlets keep honing in on this debt like it’s an ugly scar of the corporation. But what we need to focus on is why that debt came to be, how the money was spent, and how this debt was a strategic play in order to cement AMC into the new era of cinema-streaming.

We can categorize the money used into four parts:

* **New equipment and amenities**
* **Lease payments**
* **Maintenance costs (utilities, wages, etc.)**
* **Expansion (buying out the competition)**

Pay close attention to the last category because this one is important. Over the past five years, AMC has been [acquiring smaller theater companies](https://tracxn.com/d/acquisitions/acquisitionsbyAMC-Theatres) like [Odeon](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/amc-theatres-closes-odeon-uci-acquisition-become-largest-exhibitor-europe-world-951348). After buying out these companies, AMC then had to suit its ""new locations"" with the standard luxury amenities AMC is known for. This makes for a significant bulk of their debt totaling over $3 billion in just acquisitions. This was the investment that helped **solidify AMCs spot as the world's largest cinema chain**.

On the topic of maintenance costs, AMC managed to raise enough money to [get through 2021](https://variety.com/2021/film/features/amc-ceo-adam-aron-coronavirus-bankruptcy-1234891440/). With ongoing news of vaccines, we can hope their efficacy leads to a speedy reopening near mid-late 2021. But when the economy *does* reopen—and AMC is back at full operation—what will it look like?

# III. The Future of AMC

There's an elephant here.. right in this very room. Yes, streaming and cinema have had some serious beef in the past. In fact, some cinema chains are having tensions with streaming to this day. But what has AMC done in regards to streaming? They were the first to[ settle deals](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/universal-amc-theatres-historic-deal-windows-1234718737/) in order to partner up and take part in streaming revenue.

*Yup, you read that right. AMC is both having their cake and eating it too.*

Why would motion picture companies do this? Why not just end the cinema industry? To put simply, analysts are deeply underestimating the value of the ""cinema experience"". Just as I mentioned in the intro, I miss the cinemas. But I am definitely not alone. But let's not talk about me and the hypothetical ""people'', instead let's talk about research studies.

In a 3-year study done in Korea, researchers found that shortening the window of cinema exclusivity and releasing movies on streaming early[ did **not** have a significant effect on ticket sales](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3749476). And though this is a limited study done outside of the US, remember that AMC is a global corporation and these results have a hopeful outlook for the future relationship of cinema-streaming for AMC worldwide.

*""But wait, you still haven't mentioned what streaming gets out of this?""*

It's not what streaming ""gets out of this"" but rather what these motion picture companies maintain in keeping a healthy relationship with cinemas. During the peak heat of the movie theater-streaming feud, AMC[ halted the showing of Trolls](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/amc-theatres-trolls-world-tour-dispute-1234592445/) and vowed to never show a Universal Pictures film in its theaters again if they were to continue releasing their films on streaming platforms without a proper cinema-exclusivity window. But today, we can see that the tensions have fallen and both motion picture companies and AMC have found a way to mutually benefit each other.

Now besides streaming, AMC has been investing in luxury amenities as seen by their chairs, 4K laser projectors,[ MERV air filtration](https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean), and ultra-surround sound speakers. With so many locations and so many amenities, they are offering [full theater rentals](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/amc-launches-private-theater-rental-program-111020.html) with high demand during the pandemic. AMC has further cultivated their century-old movie experience into modern times. And this pandemic didn’t just change their amenities.

They had to learn how to[ cut costs and have more efficient operations](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/amc-could-benefit-from-bankruptcy-analysts-say.html) in order to survive. This only spells good news for when they emerge with better operations, more money to spend, and higher valuations. So that begs the question, how high can the company's share price go realistically?

# IV. Valuation

First, let's look at the Movie Theater industry as a whole in comparison to a few other popular entertainment industries:

[Movie Theater US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/movie-theaters-united-states/) **$17.1 billion**

[Casinos US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/non-hotel-casinos-united-states/) $15.7 billion

[Amusement Parks US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/amusement-parks-united-states/) $14 billion

[Music Label Music Production US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/major-label-music-production-united-states/) $9.4 billion

[Music Publishing US Market Size](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/music-publishing-united-states/) $7 billion

In the world of entertainment, cinema is a very lucrative business.

And, again, who is the largest movie theater chain in the world? Yup,[ AMC](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2020/12/11/amc-worlds-largest-movie-theater-chain-raises-100-million-lifeline-but-it-needs-750-million-to-survive-next-year/?sh=338d2b35257b).

Clueless CNBC dude mentioned that we retail traders[ don't trade with a fundamental reason](https://youtu.be/_KpecK1mvNo?t=1577) but is there a fundamental reason in shorting a $17 billion dollar industry GLOBAL leader down to its grave? Does AMC deserve to die? I surely don't think so.

Now I won't touch upon squeezes in this since I'm sure many of you folk have already read/heard enough about them, but I will leave this quick intuitive[ article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/investing/2021/01/27/short-squeezes-what-to-know/43360347/) about it. And yes, these shorts can and will be squoze once we have faith in our upper valuations and investors(we) begin buying again.

**And buy again we will**. As many users flee limp-dick Robinhood and join one of the real brokerages, their positions/funds will be settled and ready to trade come next week. Where do you think these angry RH refugees will be putting their investments? That's right, exactly into the positions that RH stopped them from buying last week: which includes $AMC.

If you were part of the RH user base and your plays were affected by the blatant market manipulation, it's not only ""not too late"", but I believe it is an opportune time to **BUY**.

How high can it go then? When will I know it's too late to take a position?

So when we talk about valuation, many people fear the uncertainty of a stock rising far past its current value. Well, I think Chamath Palihapitiya[ said it best](https://youtu.be/_KpecK1mvNo?t=1522):

***""Everybody that bought that stock is also underwriting how they want to own it.""***

In our current price-action environment, it's not too ridiculous to see how we are forming the foundations for AMC to continue rising beyond ATHs. We are already hitting nearly $16 on the day and rallying +53% while enduring heavy trade restrictions. Who's to say that this passion cannot continue? Now I’m no expert and can’t tell you how high this can go, but I am personally eyeing $69.69 as a target.

With so many current factors at play including hype, short covers, and ITM options having to be exercised, this is actually the BEST entrance to manifest its ATH valuation and chart some never before seen territory in its price action. **It's like the manifest destiny of stock valuation**. In fact, we may never see this opportunity for AMC again if we don't act now and solidify its value upward.

At the end of the day, prices are what the buyers/sellers settle upon so **WE** can pioneer that value if we damn well please. **This is what a free market is all about.**

*Will there be people that disagree with this?*

*Sure.*

Will people continue to short AMC as it goes up?

*Absolutely.*

Do I think that AMC being shorted 80% and rising is fair?

*Really? See section III.*

But institutions are selling off! Like [Silver Lake liquidating their 44m shares](https://www.barrons.com/articles/amc-entertainment-investor-silver-lake-sells-stake-51611962182).

*Yes, then the next day $AMC dipped to $7.50 and has since recovered…  with AMC $600m less in debt.*

We all know who is shorting AMC, and I am sick of these hedge funds who think they, alone, can decide whether or not a company is worth a damn.

# V. Conclusion - Resurgence

We are at the cusp of AMCs resurgence. Because most of us have been kept from participating in social activities, we can better understand that the public is yearning for a sense of normalcy. Sure we've gone pretty far with just watching movies on our TVs or computers through the pandemic, but that doesn't scratch the itch for many folk.

What you're investing into when you invest in AMC is the entire experience in tandem with its new streaming deals. And having been beaten so low—while still holding such great fundamental prospects— its share price is ready to blow up.

In the future when “The Deep Squeeze” is turned into a movie, we’ll be a part of history.

And you’re going to want to see it on the big screen.

From one disabled person to another please. Dont get me wrong. I am heavily invested in GME because I really like the stock. But...i do not think I will like the stock in 6+ months. I dont think GME will be worth 20bn in 6 months. After the squeeze...which might not happen...the share price could easily return to a significantly lower valuation. 

Why wouldnt the sqeeze happen? Well, only 20% of the outstanding public shares are owned by us little retard hands. That means the major price fluctuations are largely caused by massive hedge funds far larger than Melvin. We dont even know for sure that Melvin still holds the shorts. Another Mega Hedge could have bought them out and repositioned in a much better time frame. This fund could also be one of the major gamestop shareholders. What this means is that if the major shareholders decide to dump the stock will be left around 40-80 dollars a share at the current valuation.

Sticking it to the billionaires is the most room temperature IQ ""movement"" i have ever seen in my multiple years here and I congratulate each and every one of you retards for thinking thats whats happening. Most of the profits from this movement are going to go the hedge funds and insitutions that make Marvin captial look like your autistic son in the sand pit compared to your wifes boyfriend. 

The real kickers is that if they really do get left with 20-70 billion in debt they will most likely get bailed out by Mr. Rothschild and the fed and the American citizens will be left to pay back the debt with their tax dollars once again lining the pockets of billionaires.

TLDR: If you single brain cell ""investors"" are right and Melvin is stuck with a 70bn dollar bill the american peoples tax dollars will pay it and most of the profits will go to even larger cap hedge funds. Really sticking it to the billionaires retards. HOLD SHARES IN CASE I HAVE .5 brain cells and go long dated PUT options for when gamestop realizes its true market value.

Edit: Since I am in fact more than retarded, probably borderline Melvin, I need to mention that I would only play on these options during the supposed run up during the squeeze and hopefully sell during similar if not higher IV on the ride back down.

If you are have been locked in a basement for a while you may have missed that real-estate market has been hot. Low rates has made bored desperate housewifes think of buying a new house with a pool or second home where to go on a romantic weekend with their boyfriend. Try and buy a condo in a popular vacation spot like Miami. Condos are gone within a week of listing, sometimes within a day.

Mortgage rate is 3%, which makes owning a real-estate a great hedge against inflation. If inflation kicks in then the $300k condo today will be $400k in few years. And your house payment will be much lower in today’s money versus in 5 years.

[https://www.housingwire.com/articles/loan-officers-made-insane-money-in-q4-2020/](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/loan-officers-made-insane-money-in-q4-2020/)

If rates start to increase we may see even more refi efforts in 2021 to capture the low interest rates.

**Alright, so why Rocket Mortgage?**

Well it is often in the **top 3 best rated mortgage companies**. In addition, the company’s its primary focus is mortgages unlike Chase of BoA. So if mortgage numbers are good, then their numbers will be really good because their revenues is heavily depended on mortgages.

Brand recognition - It’s probably one of the most recognizable names for mortgages. Their website gets over 110 million visits per year. More than any other mortgage site.

They are innovative, they have developed a directory for all of the local mortgage brokers. Now this is interesting. They are listing the brokers and do not charge any fees for the leads to the brokers whether they work with Rocket Mortgage or not for the load. That’s lost revenue right? Well, I think that they are building a good relationship with the local brokers, so that the brokers can get the origination fee and then send them business back to get the loan via Rocket Mortgage.

**Share ownership**

They IPOd around $21.50, then went as high as $30m, and then dropped to $20 levels. **Short interest in Rocket Mortgage is 30%. But the leadership team owns 95% of the entire Rocket Companies** parent company. So this shows huge insider holding of this company, which clearly indicates their strong belief in this company. Check out their CEO’s message to the shorts [https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/29/rocket-companies-ceo-on-the-stocks-friday-surge.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/29/rocket-companies-ceo-on-the-stocks-friday-surge.html)

**Buzz**

There will be a buzz for rocket mortgage. They will have two superbowl ads this year to stay current and in people’s minds. This should play well with the time leading up to their earnings call which is coming up later in February. This can be a catalyst for the stock (it jumped last week to 23.50 with the whole shorts frenzy)

I have a good conviction on this company, but I am open to hear opposite views from you degenerates.

Positions 400 shares at $21.50. Thinking about some options too but don't have the balls to do a 30c 2/19 yet.

tl dr - I bought rocket  mortgage because I think it goes to the moon  🚀🚀🚀

It’s time to make Citron short seller feel the burn. They have shorted the sh*t out of this stock. This company has a huge pipeline of cures. HPV, Cancer, and now COVID-19. 

They have millions in funding from Department of Defense for their Cellectra Vaccine delivery device. Have you read about any stories of the army getting COVID-19? My point exactly. Connect the dots.

They’re also running trials in China and just finished phase 2. They will start phase 3 during THIS 1ST QUARTER. China also signed a $100 million deal with INO for the use of their COVID-19 vaccine. China has a HUGE market.

But  in this Holly War they started to make dirty steps like saying that other tickers like NOK or BB or SLV is bad idea. This is because they don't want to lose they money. And they don't care about money of other people that already have a deep looses.

Why I think that Nokia is a great idea for other few millions that didn't enter in GME in appropriate time. And this is a reasons:

1. During this year Nokia has taken only hold and buy ratings from all analysts including best performing. And it's not connected with WSB activity at all.
2. 3.3% of best performing individual investors started to buy Nokia. And this number is continually increasing.
3. Blogger sentiments is mostly bullish.
4. Company is based in Europe and it pretend to get profit from the expansion of the [5G market](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) in 2021. Most of all it could avoid cyber security issues in US and Europe markets in comparison with Chinese companies.
5. Nokia news sentiments is 86% bullish. There are plant of articles about 5G equipment
6. EPS was increased twice during this year (see below)
7. Dividend yield twice bigger than sector average: 1.86%, Sector Average: 0.93%
8. Nokia literally goes to the moon and pretend to be the first mobile network on the surface. Think about Space X and Virgin galactic success in this year and Catherine Wood space fund.

Its not data faking, its hedge funds hedging their shorts with calls and puts. Let me explain.

Gary Black is a guy to follow. Not always follow his advice or take everything for granted, but he gives a good insight into how hedge funds think: https://mobile.twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1356253412103512065

Gary has the opinion, that short sellers have hedged their short position by buying ATM calls and selling ATM puts that match the share count of its short. Ok, so lets run through this scenario:

1. Before expiration, the fund doesnt do anything, he has to pay the daily fee of the short interest on his shares and he loses value on his call as well as gains value on his put (because he sold it). This can draw out the short squeeze by month!
2. At expiration, if the share price is above purchase price, he can exercise the call, return the shares and the put expires worthless so he keeps the premium.
3. If the share price goes down, the call expires worthless but he buys shares with the put and returns these shares to close his short position.

In scenario 1, the short interest stays the same as nothing happens. But I can totally see the statistics to **reduce the reported short position because it is fully hedged!** In scenario 2, the call seller has to find the shares on the market. In scenario 3 its the same, but this time the put buyer has to find the shares.

**IN ALL 3 SCENARIOS, THE SHORT INTEREST STAYS THE SAME BUT THE REPORTED SHORT INTEREST GOES DOWN BECAUSE ITS SHOVED UNDER THE RUG OF THE OPTIONS TRADERS.**

Which means, the statistics might be correct, but the true short interest is still the same as before! **THE SHORTS ARE NOT OFF THE HOOK!**

No investment advice you monkeys! We have the shorts by the balls until they turn blue and fall off!

First up, I'm acting as a surrogate for u/BIO9999 as he can't post here yet but is absolutely brilliant and deserves to be heard.  He'll be around in the thread to answer questions

We are going to look at **Biocryst’s** recently approved drug **Berotralstat**, AKA **Orladeyo**. It is a **once-a-day pill** given to patients with a terrible lifelong disease called **Hereditary Angioedema**, that results in them having to **frequently visit the Emergency Room** for life-threatening angioedema attacks (check out Youtube for videos of HAE patients suffering from these attacks and using Berotralstat). It is estimated that this disease affects **1 in 50,000** people in the world, or roughly **140,000 people**, so although considered a rare disease, it is still affecting a **lot** of folks.

The available treatments for this disease are **all IV drugs** that are painful and produce local reactions. Berotralstat is the **first oral drug**. It achieved excellent results in phase 3 trials, and the US FDA gave it **fast track** status in 2018 and Japan gave it **Sakigake** status (type of fast track). Then **on December 3rd, the US granted approval for the drug**. They did it very importantly with **zero label** statements--meaning that they had no concerns about side effects or dangers. **On January 22nd, Japan granted approval**. The **EU** also met last week to discuss approval and will announce its result **this quarter**.

So let's look at what the above means for this stock. First the drug is in **HIGH** demand. In the US there are at least **10,000** people with HAE. Despite the disease being frequently debilitating, patients are so uncomfortable about getting regular injections that **only 7,500** are currently being treated with IV injections. The other 2,500 are going **untreated** despite the high risks. Now let's look at the 7,500 patients on a prophylactic treatment. Based on numerous surveys by doctors, the company, and researchers, most of these people would prefer an oral treatment. Take a look at this peer-reviewed survey article finding that [98% of IV prophylactic patients (the 7,500) would prefer an oral treatment and 96% of the non-prophylactic patients (the 2,500) would want an oral treatment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489436/).

No wonder then that one of the preeminent biotech analysts, Evercore's Liisa Bayko, wrote to her clients on December 4th that Berotralstat was likely to quickly **take at least 30% of the HAE market** based on Evercore surveys of patient and doctor demand.

Remember that this is **just the US**.... Japan did not even have any prophylactic treatment until Berotralstat was approved there a few days ago. They have **500 people registered with HAE** and estimated **2,000 ready to be registered**. [The UK is so desperate to add the drug for its patients, it did not even wait until the formal approval process to go through and gave early access to the drug on November 9th](https://angioedemanews.com/2020/11/09/berotralstat-available-to-eligible-patients-uk-through-early-access-program/#:~:text=Berotralstat%20%E2%80%94%20an%20oral%20therapy%20by,before%20its%20potential%20regulatory%20approval).

The EU is not far behind, with its estimated **20,000 patients**, with approval coming in the next few weeks. Then there is the rest of the world. The HAE patient population in **Latin America** is estimated by **HAE International**, the most important advocacy organization for HAE patients worldwide and one of **Berotralstat’s biggest supporters**, to be **over 15,000 patients**, the vast majority of whom are poorly diagnosed and not prophylactically treated. Argentina and Brazil have the highest actual diagnostic rates. HAEI through its Latin American sister organizations is strongly advocating for Berotralstat in Latin America.

Next, it should be noted that Biocryst built a **world-class sales team** for this drug in the US and EU and signed a **partnership with Torii in Japan** to take charge of the large sales and marketing promotion there. It has hired dozens of professionals, most from its HAE competitors. Its **vice-president** and US general manager **Allen Hodge** was even responsible for the **successful efforts of the HAE drug launches** of Cinryze and Firazyr, two pioneering injectable treatments for HAE. You could not get a more promising leader for this task.

It should also be pointed out that this drug, an oral kallikrein inhibitor, is potentially of **huge value for a host of diseases, including COVID-19** (that is now recognized to severely affect the kallikrein-kinin system, and kallikrein inhibitors have begun to be tested against COVID19--see this (IV) **kallikrein inhibitor trial that was just announced in Brazil** for instance: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/)), **diabetic macular edema** (which Biocryst just obtained a patent on a technique to administer kallikrein inhibitors for), many autoimmune diseases, and even some types of cancer.

Last but not least, how should this stock be valued based on this one drug? First, this drug is **one of the 10 most expensive drugs** (based on its annual cost of prescription) in the world, but still **less than the price of its IV competitors**, at $488,000 per patient per year. This drug is being approved by insurance companies **left, right, and center** as their preferred treatment, all you have to do is follow [R8](https://stocktwits.com/R8Plus) or [nickpd](https://stocktwits.com/nickpd) on Stocktwits to see how many insurance companies have been making it easy for patients to sign up for the drug. [Optime care even lets patients get direct-to-patient prescriptions now](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biocryst-scores-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-first-oral-option-to-prevent-hae-attacks).

So what does all this mean for sales? And why is the stock not valued based on just this drug alone (I will get to the others in **future posts**)? I **estimate conservatively** that by December 2021, there will be **over 6,000 patients on Berotralstat in the US, EU and Japan**, and I can share in a future post the graphs and calculations I made to get to those numbers. 6,000 patients annualized is up to **$2.9 billion in annual sales**. **Most** of this is going to be **profit**. At a **conservative price to sales ratio of 7**, that should produce a price of **$121, not $8.52**!  If you want to play around with the math yourself, look [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLvclUzTqCitwKfawL7kGCLquJxA2T7IJKLg52VWotE/edit?usp=sharing).

And that is **just the beginning**. Because Factor D and Galidesivir are going to be much bigger than Berotralstat for reasons I will explain in future posts. Remember that **its Factor D drug, which is showing superiority to all other anti-complement drugs in Phase I trials and was fast-tracked and given orphan status by the FDA and now is in Phase 2 though not officially announced by the company eyt,** and can be used in at least 20 diseases including common ones like Rheumatoid Arthritis, is currently **not even factoring into BCRX's valuation**. Consider that **Alexion with its significantly inferior anti-complement drug was just sold to Astra-Zeneca for $39 billion** because of the **recognized potential of anti-complement drugs** for a host of diseases. BCRX even has has **other drugs like Peramivir, already approved for Influenza and able to be used for the next bird flu pandemic, and its FOP drug--a story for another day**.

So why is this company, with **zero risk of dilution** due to an **amazing royalty deal** it signed in December and **three super-drugs** each worth tens of billions of dollars, and a host of other exciting developments to look forward to, **worth only $1.5 billion right now?** It can only be because the company's stock has been **relentlessly shorted in 2020 and 2021** to allow for significant accumulation by institutions. That is why the stock **only went up 168%**, yes ""***ONLY***"" **168%**...

The time for BCRX investors is **now**. My next post will be about Factor D, brace for that one. Factor D is 10 times bigger than Berotralstat! Good luck to all!

So PENN owns barstool and sportsbooks, DKNG has daily fantasy and sports betting, and I think there are multiple reasons why buying calls would be good. The runup to the Superbowl, the increase in popularity of gambling/sports betting, and states will continue to legalize sportsbetting.

First off, the Superbowl is coming up on February 7th. You all know you are going to bet massive amounts this year with all your tendies. Mahomes and Brady is a huge draw. There is going to be record sports betting on the Superbowl which is going to signal massive growth for these companies.

Second, we've all become rich this year and have money to blow. We are the key demographic for sports gambling. Without a doubt we are going to see record inflows into sportsbetting in the future. It has the potential to be a trillion dollar industry.

Third, US states are dying for money right now. Cuomo has said he wants to legalize sports betting in NY to help raise revenue. That is a huge market and would be huge for PENN and DKNG. ([https://www.barrons.com/articles/draftkings-penn-national-jump-on-news-that-cuomo-supports-making-online-sports-betting-legal-51609984632?mod=article\_inline](https://www.barrons.com/articles/draftkings-penn-national-jump-on-news-that-cuomo-supports-making-online-sports-betting-legal-51609984632?mod=article_inline)). Here's a Cuomo quote from this article:

""New York has the potential to be the largest sports wagering market in the United States, and by legalizing online sports betting we aim to keep millions of dollars in revenue here at home, which will only strengthen our ability to rebuild from the \[Covid-19\] crisis.”

I mean it is a no brainer for these states to legalize sports betting for raising revenue. No reason why other states wouldn't feel the same way as NY.

Everyone has become gambling degens now with the GME short squeeze. We need our fix. Sportsbetting is going to have massive growth. The tailwind of the Superbowl and states legalizing are going to cause these stocks to moon.

Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.


Typical tactics include the following:

Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.

The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.

By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.

Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.


Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:

Media Assault -

The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.

The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.

One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This ""mistake"" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ""Due to a mathematical error"" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.

Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.

This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.


Analyst Reports -

Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned ""friendly"" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.

Planting moles in target companies -

The shorts plant ""moles"" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.

Frivolous SEC investigations -

The shorts ""leak"" tips to the SEC about ""corporate malfeasance"" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed ""confidential inquiry"" is leaked to the short media.

The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.

Class Action lawsuits -

Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.

Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. -

If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.


Pulling margin from long customers -

The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Click here for more on Pulling Margin).

Paid bashers -

The shorts will hire paid bashers who ""invade"" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher).

This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.

How Pervasive Is This?

At any given point in time more than 100 emerging companies are under attack as described above. This is not to be confused with the day-to-day shorting that occurs in virtually every stock, which is purportedly about thirty percent of the daily volume.

The success rate for short attacks is over ninety percent-a success being defined as putting the company into bankruptcy or driving the stock price to pennies. It is estimated that 1000 small companies have been put out of business by the shorts. Admittedly, not every small company deserves to succeed, but they do deserve a level playing field.

The secrecy that surrounds the shorts, the prime brokers, the DTC and the regulatory agencies makes it impossible to accurately estimate how much money has been stolen from the investing public by these predators, but the total is measured in billions of dollars.

Also not saying sell GME so get that “only GME matters” bullshit out of here!

To the point: SPCE “pleas fly again” isn’t flying right now in the real world, but SpaceX is and they’re bringing civilians. This is bringing a lot of attention to SPCE for a number of reasons and I think it’s an excellent catalyst opportunity for the following reasons:

1. This legitimizes commercial space travel to a great extent and it will bring this new category to the forefront of conversations for the coming weeks/months. To my understanding, virgin is not doing so badly in this department themselves, so it shouldn’t be challenging for them to get early adoption.

2. Short interest is high as shit. Contrary to what many of you have been taught, it does NOT take 100%+ short float to cause an epic squeeze. These happen all the time when black swans fuck up bear trades. GME was just the first time a community like our successfully triggered one. With that said, SPCE sits at 50%+ short interest, and was the third most shorted stock on the market following GME and AMC. The big difference is, unlike those two names that were recovery plays, this is an emerging business and is being shorted purely on valuation despite valuation being near impossible.

3. Valuing a stock like this is esoteric and I defined. This is a pre revenue company, but it’s one of the only players in a market that will be $30 billion+ by 2030 according to UBS. Let’s assume 33% market share and a 2.5x price to sales multiple (good airline average js around 1.6), then you’d get a $25 billion fair value in 2030. Given this thing will likely be growing much faster than any airline, and the fact that it’s balance sheet is fucking stacked $720+ mil cash vs around $40 mil in debt, this isn’t outrageously priced. A lot less risky than hoping GME somehow justifies a $30 Billion market cap (again, not bashing it, just rationalizing that this isn’t a crazy idea).

4. Low share count = high volatility. Not than many shares on the market, around 150 mil total and in the ballpark of 70 mil in the float. This baby could move, and, unlike a mature GME or AMC, you shouldn’t count on insider bailing considering this is super early in the growth curve. This means less surprises and less risky for big at the market capital raises. (Again, not bearish on either name, long live apes!)

5. People are fucking stupid. People buy the wrong ticker all the time. ZM vs ZOOM. Hell, I’m stupid, I bought the wrong ticker for Fisker, but so are other apes and I still made money! My dad even told me I need to add “SpaceX, symbols SPCE” months and months ago, and had no idea it was Virgin Galactic. I wouldn’t be shocked if half the people in the AH though this was SpaceX, hell, I wouldn’t be surprised if half of you reading this thought it was SpaceX.

In short, this seems like an excellent trade idea that’s primed for a short squeeze pop. That’s why I’m buying at least.

Truth is, I ain’t got the guts of steel to go into volatility like that. I wish all you brothers and sisters best of luck though. 

Right before the pandemic, Xerox traded at \~$38 dollars. The pandemic did affect their revenues, bopping it down to 7 billion annually, from the previous years 9 and some billion. 

This, along with pandemic stock battering, seems to have messed up Xerox’s valuation. Take a look at some of these numbers, which I pulled from tradingview. 

Market Cap: 4.48B

Total Assets: 14.741B

Total Debt: 4.86B

Free Cash Flow: 592M 

Gross Profit: 2.562B

This is all numbers from a pandemic battered year. I personally expect these numbers to go higher, given the end of the pandemic is now just perhaps half a year out. The stock trades right now, at $22.59. 

Let me do complete monkey math for a second: 14.741-4.86 = 9.881 =/= 4.48, not accounting the fact that they have a massive cash flow. To some extent the cash flows contribution can discounted, granted that they are a dividend stock with a yield somewhere near 4%. 

Xerox today also announced some business management shuffling, which is projected to boost growth and more clearly organize the business’s operations. I think their stock should thus have some incredible upside, both to us WSBers, and to those looking to invest in a sensible dividend stock. 

If you read this far, please share your thoughts too, this is basic numbers I’m sure you guys know more complex terms. 

This isn’t professional advice. 

Positions: I bought \~$600 of XRX calls for April, target $25. This is all I can afford till my next paycheck, when I’ll go in bigger. 

P.S. don’t expect anything related to a short squeeze, short% of float is small compared to what we are seeing."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082633.csv|DueDiligence|['XRX']|['XRX']|['GME', 'I', 'XRX', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'M', 'B', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'XRX', 'I', 'P', 'S']|['GME', 'XRX', 'XRX']

This is due to short ladder attacks done by hedge funds which is a form of market manipulation to lower the price artificially, scare us, and get us to sell our shares to them to cover.

We know this for two reasons.

1. Volume: The volume for the last couple trading days was quite low. What is volume? It’s the act of trading (buying and selling) shares for that day. Today, the volume was just not high enough to justify such a dip. The same thing is happening after hours where volume is MUCH lower because the US market doesn’t have access to the the stock. Low volume means low volatility. These dips were HIGH volatility, but with low volume, which means the high volatility cannot be explained by the low volume, but instead of a short ladder attack. 

2. Bid/Ask Gap: If you have access to Level 2 data on Robinhood Gols (which is free for the first month and 5 dollars every subsequent month), you will notice that expanding the stock chart will reveal the option to add extra data. Among this data is the Bid Ask chart. This chart simply shows you how many shares are ready to be sold at a certain price and how many shares are ready to be bought at a certain price. The Gap between them is the difference between the average bid (buyers) and ask (sellers). Today’s gap was a whopping 5 dollars which is quite big. The average gap would just be a few cents on normal trading days.

3. Some of you may think, “if they keep short laddering this, can’t they just keep doing it to cover their positions?” Well, they still have to buy shares from people and as we saw in the chart, even when the price fell, people massively bought as opposed to sold. Meaning every ladder attack leads to a huge upswing in price. The base for all this is around 100 dollars, it’s hard for it to go lower with all this attention, and a big whale will definitely eat that up. 

In the end, HOLD. The fundamentals and sympathy is on our side.

But what do I know, I’m retarded. This is not financial advice, do your own Due Diligence.

on 1/29, [S3 reported](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20) that projected short interest was 113.31% of float with 57.83M shares shorted. Important to note is that this data represents their estimates for END OF DAY ON 1/28.

on 2/1, [Ihor Dusaniwsky](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356261806612885509?s=20) S3's managing director of predictive analytics reported that projected short interest was 53.15% of float with 27.12M shares shorted. This data represents their estimates for END OF DAY ON 1/29

This means that shorts had to purchase at least 30.71M shares on Friday total (including pre and post market trading).

On Friday, we saw a trading volume of 50.25M [source](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?p=GME)

 ## What does this mean?
The data stands up to the test of basic math. There WAS enough trading volume on Friday for shorts to cover and GME ended the day up about $120 / share.

## Conclusions and Opinions (NOT DATA)

I suspect that most of the older shorts have in fact covered on Friday. Retail was still heavily limited in volume due to Robinhood and other broker trading restrictions, and I doubt retail had enough fuel on their own to explain the rise in price on Friday. It is fully possible that AT THE CURRENT MOMENT we won't have another short squeeze. I closed my GME positions this morning at $250 due to a relatively high cost basis and seeing that there is some truth to shorts covering. If short interest picks up again and the price dips low enough, I may re-enter. Y'all probably think I'm paper handed, but I did what I thought was best given my current situation. If I had actually gotten in back when it was sub $100, I might have been a lot more comfortable holding.

Some people will probably say that 50%+ short interest is pretty high, however I currently suspect most of those shorts entered their positions above the $300 mark, and thus can handle a lot of pain before they are squoze. Retail would need to drive the price up significantly on their own before we see more squeeze IMO.

I'm a retard, don't take financial advice from me.

See the chart linked above. This is why the current price of $GME is a misleading indicator of the actual situation at hand. The turquoise/salmon bars at the bottom indicate the volume traded. The chart starts on Jan 11th on the left and ends with today, Feb 1st on the right. Today was the lowest volume traded since this whole rocket ship really started blasting off. The price movements from today were most likely from ladder attacks trying to trigger a panic sell.

Additionally, the thin green bars at the bottom are a Squeeze Momentum indicator (measures volatility). The squeeze officially started on Jan 13th and has been building momentum steadily over the past two weeks. It appears that the pressure is building.

This is not a financial advice, do your own DD and know your risk tolerance, especially in these wild times.*

Before reading my take on the subject, [please go read u/johnnydaggers take before. It's the most interesting thing I've read this week-end](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)


💎 **STATUS QUO** 💎


In a game of musical chairs slowing down because of a drying liquidity, both parties may be stuck for a while in an inconfortable position. Shorts are experiencing a slow burn paying interests for their borrowed shares and Longs might feel discouraged with a sense of injustice turning odds against them (especially retail investors).
The problem is, paid interests are marginal (millions) when that could be much much worse with an ever increasing percentage of longs which has been quite halted since last Thursday. Shorts are then playing against the clock hoping for some backup by the SEC simply freezing the trade of $GME for ten days or more, killing momentum and scaring people away --> papers hands flying in the eye of the storm. 

What can we do other than buying more shares and holding? Most of us are out of ammo and holding has its limitations too. We've gone a long way, me might have already landed in the moon unknowingly but I know we all aim for more.
But lets be realistic for a second, we've just invaded Dirty Money People playground and they know every corner of it. We may be in a strong position regarding $GME, but we don't drive the narrative for the remaining 99.99% of the stock market. Shorts still can make big bucks elsewhere, even though they have to liquidate their assets to fund our Nintendos, Teslas, dildo shaped rockets to effing Mars, etc. 

SHARES DON'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE. Yes we already know.
SHORTED SHARES DON'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE. Ok we know that too, they *only* have interests to pay.


💎 **NOT JET FUEL BUT OUT OF THIS WORLD NUCLEAR BLAST TYPE FUEL** 💎


What do we do to **FORCE** them to buy those shares NEXT WEEK?
What has always been our weapon of choice?
Last week we were too much focused on owning our shares and holding that we collectively agreed that options were not the best way to trigger the MOASS. The plan was followed religiously and that's still an advantage.


💎 **What my only wrinkle whispered to me while in bed this morning** 💎

⠀
As you retards already now, ITM options can be exercised for shares : 100xcontracts you own.
Meaning, past the expiration date, those shares HAVE TO be bought within the following week and given to you lucky retards.
Unfortunately, right now, one single of those safe contract cost so much that most of us can't afford it anymore.
*Wrote this half assed DD this morning and it seems like options buying has been made difficult in several brokerages, meaning they don't want us to go this way...*

NOW we need bigger fishes to light a fire so hot Shorts would not have time to lose their shirts but cook instantly! We need rich kids and mad billionaires!

IF we collectively hold and harden our diamonds hands even more in this week to come, and have rich troopers coming to buy every single deep ITM and ITM calls there is, next week is going to trigger the biggest chain reaction and propel us so fast that we could attain light speed in a snap and reach $69,420.69 ☮️


💎 **PAPA MUSK, if you are reading this poorly made DD, don't buy shares, buy far ITM options to force their hands and make us 0.001% as rich as you!! I'll definitely buy a Tesla if it goes higher than $6000** 💎

You don't need to convince anybody to hold their shares; have confidence and hold strong, here is why:

Today we shook all of the paper hands. I repeat: TODAY WE SHOOK ALL OF THE PAPER HANDS. Every single mf holding the stock has💎 **diamond**  💎 hands and will not sell. **DFV is still in**, I'm still in, we are STILL IN. We have created a moat.

Potential upcoming catalysts:

* Potential announcements from gamestop regarding their outlook and business plans
* More celebrity shoutouts and support by the day.
* ITM calls from friday must be settled tomorrow at the latest
* Legal developments (ie SEC involvement, congressional hearings)
* More people realizing silver is a fucking scam.
* WSB subscribers up to 8 million (was 6-7 million last week) and continuing to rise this week.
* Official/reliable government short data released feb 9 or something

&#x200B;

**Addressing doubts:**

* According to some sources, the short percentage has dropped:

We don't know the actual short percentage. All numbers we have are estimates, which can easily be manipulated by shorters with various tactics (using options, etc) or methodology changes (not accounting synthetic longs, etc). Even if we do accept the data from S3, the short squeeze thesis is not contested or done-- as long as people hold the shorts still lose money whether they have an absurdly pants-on-fire high amount, or a lower but still insanely high amount. The true ""float"" of shares gets lower and lower as more and more diamond hands enter at dips. It is even possible to short squeeze at 10% (and lower) if nobody sells and buying ramps up due to some catalysts. Keep in mind they could add more shorts today or at any time if they believe we are losing momentum.

&#x200B;

* What if the whales rug pull us? (or some shady under-the-table deal, etc)

&#x200B;

The whales want to make money too, and they make the most money off of volatility and GME staying high and popular. They have the retail data, they read wsb. They know you fucks ain't selling. If they wanted us to tank the price would already be 40. They would never let short sellers off the hoo knowing they could squeeze them dry.

&#x200B;

* What if shorts never give up and continue to lower the price?

I don't know about you but I believe in the stubbornness of our community of apes (which lose nothing from holding) more than hedge funds which are losing money daily. They don't want to tie up capital on losing trades for such an extended period of time.

&#x200B;

* ""Veterans"" and people with ""concerns""

Likely holding puts or have no better idea wtf is happening than you do. What do they hope they accomplish with these ""concerns""? Are they helping you by trying to spark a panic sell?

&#x200B;

Welcome people's doubts with open arms and offer your rebuttals: our community has a diamond will.

These are just my dumb thoughts, godspeed apes.

TLDR for you retards who don’t have the patience and/or the ability to read is located at the bottom.

**Summary** 🚀🚀

XL fleet is a company primarily involved with the electrification of commercial fleet vehicles across the US.  This company aims to reduce carbon emissions by vehicles by fitting vehicles with electric components to transform gas powered vehicles into hybrids.

**The players**🚀🚀

Tod Hynes- The founder and president of XL Fleet who currently is a senior professor at MIT, where he lectures a graduate course, Energy Ventures. He also co-founded the MIT Clean Energy Prize.

Dimitri Kazarinoff- Current CEO of XL fleet. He is an accomplished transportation industry executive who has led impressive growth, expansion and innovation throughout his career. Prior to joining XL as CEO, Dimitri successfully scaled the hybrid power systems division of Eaton Corporation by 15x within two years.  He also has worked at General Motors.

Needless to say, the current leadership of XL fleet has decades of experience not only in Clean Energy, but also in leadership and expansion.

**Application**🚀🚀

The Implementation of electric components to vehicles is no doubt extremely beneficial to both the customer and the environment. Here’s how:

- XL’s hybrid electric  drive system improves vehicle MPG by up to 25% and reduces CO2 emissions by up to 20% for Class 2-6 fleets.

- Their Plug-In drive system improved vehicle MPG by up to 50% and reduces CO2 emissions by 33% in Ford F-150 and F-250 pickup trucks.

- XL grid is XL’s charging and power stations, and simultaneously function as driving data site analysis and solar power sites. 

These figures are pretty impressive, and saving the consumer money via gasoline consumption and saving the environment via reduced CO2 emissions is a win-win.

** Other Info**🚀🚀

- On Jan 21, 2021 XL fleet was named one of the Top 100 Impact Companies by Real Leaders Magazine

- Partners with GM and Ford, along with other well-established and successful companies such as Coca-Cola. 

- The US government will replace its entire fleet of 645,000 cars and trucks with US-made electric vehicles, president Joe Biden said on Jan. 25, while signing a “Buy America” executive order that creates new guidelines for the government’s $600 billion in annual spending on goods and services.  XL fleet can capitalize on this opportunity to further expand their operations and boost their publicity

🚀🚀- This stock is currently over 70% shorted with a low float (~8,000,000). Now this is not the next GME by any means, but I believe that the foundation that this company has and the fact that the Biden Administration is focusing so heavily on EV will drive this stock upward quickly. 🚀🚀

**TLDR**

XL fleet is poised to rocket to the stratosphere based on its foundation, application under the Biden administration, and its partnerships (All mentioned above).  Couple this with its low float and high short percentage (70%+) and we’ve got ourselves an early boarding pass to Alpha  Centauri. 

Alright retards, resume brandishing those pitchforks and rage on against Robinhood, Citadel, Melvin, and 🏳️‍🌈🐻, but do so with XL fleet in mind.  

Giraffe out.

Positions- 200 shares and several 8/20 25c

What’s Happened the Past Few Days?: The Anatomy of a Short Ladder Attack

Published courtesy of Citizens for Securities Reform, at http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html

Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.


Typical tactics include the following:

Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.

The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.

By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.

Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.


Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:

Media Assault -

The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.

The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.

One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This ""mistake"" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ""Due to a mathematical error"" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.

Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.

This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.


Analyst Reports -

Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned ""friendly"" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.

Planting moles in target companies -

The shorts plant ""moles"" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.

Frivolous SEC investigations -

The shorts ""leak"" tips to the SEC about ""corporate malfeasance"" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed ""confidential inquiry"" is leaked to the short media.

The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.

Class Action lawsuits -

Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.

Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. -

If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.


Pulling margin from long customers -

The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Click here for more on Pulling Margin).

Paid bashers -

The shorts will hire paid bashers who ""invade"" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher).

This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.

How Pervasive Is This?

At any given point in time more than 100 emerging companies are under attack as described above. This is not to be confused with the day-to-day shorting that occurs in virtually every stock, which is purportedly about thirty percent of the daily volume.

The success rate for short attacks is over ninety percent-a success being defined as putting the company into bankruptcy or driving the stock price to pennies. It is estimated that 1000 small companies have been put out of business by the shorts. Admittedly, not every small company deserves to succeed, but they do deserve a level playing field.

The secrecy that surrounds the shorts, the prime brokers, the DTC and the regulatory agencies makes it impossible to accurately estimate how much money has been stolen from the investing public by these predators, but the total is measured in billions of dollars. The problem is also international in scope"|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|['GME']|['GME']|['DTC', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'ATM', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'USA', 'CNBC', 'A', 'USA', 'TASER', 'USA', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'A', 'DTC']|[]

I decided to double-check my original BB DD, as a way to remind myself of why I invested in the first place. From my point of view, nothing has changed in the fundamentals, and I am still very well satisfied with my investment.

Currently, I have 410 stocks, with an average buy-in of $17,62 per stock.

Before getting down to the good stuff, I just want to point out that **this is in no way financal advice**, neither do I take any responsibility for your financial choices based on my text. I'm just your average happy amateur.

**THE PHONE COMPANY THAT SWITCHED TO IoT AND CYBER SECURITY**

For starters, you can't really exclusively call Blackberry a phone company anymore. They've switched their main focus to Cyber Security and IoT. Today, BB provides solutions for Unified Endpoint Security, Penetration Testing, Ransomware Protection and Blackberry QNX (remember that last one, because it's important).

In December of 2020, a massive attack occured against SolarWinds, a major IT firm that provides software for entities ranging from Fortune 500 companies to the US government. The US agencies in question that got attacked were: parts of the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and the Treasury.

However, **not a single of BlackBerry's customers were affected by the hack**.

**BLACKBERRY QNX**

Blackberry owns and develops the closed source QNX operating system, which is a real-time operating system (meaning that it can process data without buffer delays). If you have a smartphone or a car, chances are that in one way or another, it runs with QNX embedded.

Read more about QNX [here](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-150-million-vehicles).

**PARTNERSHIP WITH BAIDU, XPENG and GAC GROUP: EV-INDUSTRY IN CHINA**

Just like in other developed parts of the world, it's springtime for the electrical vehicle-market in China. You might have heard about some of their most successful brands: NIO, BAIDU, XPENG and GAC group.

NIO has a market cap of **$61.6 bn**, XPENG has a market cap of **$31.5 bn**, Baidu has a market cap of **$80,16**, and GAC group has a market cap of a whooping **$114,7 bn**.

Why is this good for Blackberry?

1. In August 2020, BB announced that they will be *""powering the Level 3 driving domain controller of Xpeng""* using... you guessed it! **QNX!**
2. A couple of weeks ago, BB announced that they would deepen their partnership with Chinese GAC Group, who amongst other things make electric cars. I read an article from a couple of days ago claiming that *""Future GAC electric cars will get BlackBerry driving assistance technology""* using... you guessed it! **QNX!**
3. Since April 2019, GAC group and NIO (the other EV maker) has had a joint venture in the form of the brand ""Hycan"", an electric car manufacturer. It's not farfetched to believe that there is a good chance of the Hycans to have QNX embedded as well.

**PARTNERSHIP WITH AMAZON**

As you all probably already know, Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce and cloud platform company. BlackBerry recently partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to launch a new connected vehicle platform that merges BlackBerry's QNX operating system with AWS's IoT services.

AWS launched its IoT platform in 2015. At the time, Amazon stated that it would make it easier for developers to create apps that link to myriad IoT gadgets, including smart speakers, home appliances, wearables, and connected cars. AWS is already the world's top cloud platform, so it makes perfect sense to integrate its IoT service into the most widely used embedded operating system for connected cars.

By linking QNX to the cloud, automakers can instantly monitor a vehicle's EV battery levels and vehicle subsystems, provide over-the-air software updates, and personalize vehicle cockpits,  advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and machine learning models for autonomous driving through cloud-based apps.

This reinforces BlackBerry's market-dominating position in embedded operating systems for connected cars, which also circles back to BB's endevours on the Chinese EV-market.

**PROJECT KUIPER**

I want to warn you all that this next part is purely speculation on my part.

From Wikipedia:  **Kuiper Systems LLC** is a subsidiary of Amazon that was set up in 2019 to deploy a large broadband satellite internet constellation to provide broadband internet connectivity. The deployment is also referred to by its project name ""**Project Kuiper**"". Amazon announced that it would be investing $10 billion in this project to deploy the satellite internet constellation.

How could BB fit into this thing?

Well, here's my hypothesis:

Why would Amazon start a long-term partnership with BlackBerry? Well, because BlackBerry has competency that Amazon lacks in-house of course. If Amazon wants to send satellites to space, why wouldn't they use Blackberry, when QNX has already been used in rockets by NASA and SpaceX?

Although there isn't any concrete evidence for my claims about BB and Project Kuiper, I personally don't believe that my thougts are way ""out there"". I guess time will tell if I'm right, but it's what I'm betting on!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TL;DR:

* BB's QNX operating system could become huge during 2021 due to BB's involvement with Amazon and Chinese EV-manufacturers.
* BB could play an important part in Project Kuiper"|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['I', 'BB', 'I', 'BB', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'THE', 'PHONE', 'MPANY', 'THAT', 'TCHED', 'TO', 'T', 'AND', 'CYBER', 'T', 'BB', 'QNX', 'IT', 'US', 'US', 'BERRY', 'QNX', 'QNX', 'QNX', 'RSHIP', 'WITH', 'BAIDU', 'XPENG', 'GAC', 'USTRY', 'IN', 'NIO', 'BAIDU', 'XPENG', 'GAC', 'NIO', 'XPENG', 'GAC', 'BB', 'QNX', 'A', 'BB', 'GAC', 'I', 'GAC', 'QNX', 'GAC', 'NIO', 'EV', 'QNX', 'RSHIP', 'WITH', 'QNX', 'T', 'AWS', 'T', 'T', 'AWS', 'T', 'QNX', 'EV', 'OJECT', 'I', 'BB', 'QNX', 'NASA', 'X', 'BB', 'I', 'I', 'QNX', 'BB']|['NIO', 'NIO', 'NIO']

The price currently does not matter AT ALL - if anything, this is a plus. Just buy and diamond hand this. Citadel is currently hurting and desperate including other big firms shorting GME (keep in mind some big whales are still holding stocks for GME). What we saw today was the most obvious attempt at ping ponging the stocks between the shorters causing the price to fall even at such low volumes - Almost a disgrace to call this a volume, as it was almost no volume. Check out [tradingview.com](https://tradingview.com) for example.  The price is not reflective of the situation at all. And remember, why are all these things happening?

&#x200B;

\- Tons of bots promoting anything other than GME.

\- Tons of news saying WSB was responsible for a surge in SLV and an apparent squeeze which will NEVER happen. Citadel holdst the 6th most shares in SLV.

\- Tons of TV-news reporting the same

\- The stock being sold way undervalue between hedge funds that have shorted the stock by over 110%.

\- Portraying us as lazy, greedy,  irrational and Alt-right people promoting GME

Im not a financial advisor this is mot advice. Just a detailed explanation of what i believe could be going on. This is not my words it is from an article. When i posted the link it was getting deleted so i posted the most important part


The Creation of Counterfeit Shares — There are a variety of names that the securities industry has dreamed up that are euphemisms for counterfeit shares. Don't be fooled : Unless the short seller has actually borrowed a real share from the account of a long investor, the short sale is counterfeit. It doesn't matter what you call it and it may become non–counterfeit if a share is later borrowed, but until then, there are more shares in the system than the company has sold.


The magnitude of the counterfeiting is hundreds of millions of shares every day, and it may be in the billions. The real answer is locked within the prime brokers and the DTC. Incidentally, counterfeiting of securities is as illegal as counterfeiting currency, but because it is all done electronically, has other identifiers and industry rules and practices, i.e. naked shorts, fails–to–deliver, SHO exempt, etc. the industry and the regulators pretend it isn't counterfeiting. Also, because of the regulations that govern the securities, certain counterfeiting falls within the letter of the rules. The rules, by design, are fraught with loopholes and decidedly short on allowing companies and investors access to information about manipulations of their stock.


The creation of counterfeit shares falls into three general categories. Each category has a plethora of devices that are used to create counterfeit shares.
Fails–to–Deliver — If a short seller cannot borrow a share and deliver that share to the person who purchased the (short) share within the three days allowed for settlement of the trade, it becomes a fail–to–deliver and hence a counterfeit share; however the share is transacted by the exchanges and the DTC as if it were real. Regulation SHO, implemented in January 2005 by the SEC, was supposed to end wholesale fails–to–deliver, but all it really did was cause the industry to exploit other loopholes, of which there are plenty (see 2 and 3 below).
Since forced buy–ins rarely occur, the other consequences of having a fail–to–deliver are inconsequential, so it is frequently ignored. Enough fails–to–deliver in a given stock will get that stock on the SHO list, (the SEC's list of stocks that have excessive fails–to–deliver) – which should (but rarely does) see increased enforcement. Penalties amount to a slap on the wrist, so large fails–to–deliver positions for victim companies have remained for months and years.


A major loophole that was intentionally left in Reg SHO was the grandfathering in of all pre–SHO naked shorting. This rule is akin to telling bank robbers, “If you make it to the front door of the bank before the cops arrive, the theft is okay.”
Only the DTC knows for certain how many short shares are perpetual fails–to–deliver, but it is most likely in the billions. In 1998, REFCO, a large short hedge fund, filed bankruptcy and was unable to meet margin calls on their naked short shares. Under this scenario, the broker dealers are the next line of financial responsibility. The number of shares that allegedly should have been bought in was 400,000,000, but that probably never happened. The DTC — owned by the broker dealers — just buried 400,000,000 counterfeit shares in their system, where they allegedly remain — grandfathered into “legitimacy” by the SEC. Because they are grandfathered into “legitimacy”, the SEC, DTC and prime brokers pretend they are no longer fails–to–deliver, even though the victim companies have permanently suffered a 400 million share dilution in their stock.


Three months prior to SHO, the aggregate fails–to–deliver on the NASDAQ and the NYSE averaged about 150 million shares a day. Three months after SHO it dropped by about 20 million, as counterfeit shares found new hiding places (see 2 and 3 below). It is noteworthy that aggregate fails–to–deliver are the only indices of counterfeit shares that the DTC and the prime brokers report to the SEC. The bulk of the counterfeiting remains undisclosed, so don't be deceived when the SEC and the industry minimize the fails–to–deliver information. It is akin to the lookout on the Titanic reporting an ice cube ahead.
Ex–clearing counterfeiting — The second tier of counterfeiting occurs at the broker dealer level. This is called ex–clearing. Multiple tricks are utilized for the purpose of disguising naked shorts that are fails–to–deliver as disclosed shorts, which means that a share has been borrowed. They also make naked shorts “invisible” to the system so they don't become fails–to–deliver, which is the only thing the SEC tracks.
Some of the tricks are as follows:
Stock sales are either a long sale or a short sale. When a stock is transacted the broker checks the appropriate box. By mismarking the trading ticket –checking the long box when it is actually a short sale the short never shows up, unless they get caught, which doesn't happen often. The position usually gets reconciled when the short covers.
Settlement of stock transactions is supposed to occur within three days, at which time a naked short should become a fail–to–deliver, however the SEC routinely and automatically grants a number of extensions before the naked short gets reported as a fail–to–deliver. Most of the short hedge funds and broker dealers have multiple entities, many offshore, so they sell large naked short positions from entity to entity. Position rolls, as they are called, are frequently done broker to broker, or hedge fund to hedge fund, in block trades that never appear on an exchange. Each movement resets the time clock for the naked position becoming a fail–to–deliver and is a means of quickly getting a company off of the SHO threshold list.
The prime brokers may do a buy–in of a naked short position. If they tell the short hedge fund that we are going to buy–in at 3:59 EST on Friday, the hedge fund naked shorts into their own buy–in (or has a co–conspirator do it) and rolls their position, hence circumventing Reg SHO.
Most of the large broker dealers operate internationally, so when regulators come in (they almost always “call ahead”) or compliance people come in (ditto), large naked positions are moved out of the country and returned at a later date.


The stock lend is enormously profitable for the broker dealers who charge the short sellers large fees for the “borrowed” shares, whether they are real or counterfeit. When shares are loaned to a short, they are supposed to remain with the short until he covers his position by purchasing real shares. The broker dealers do one–day lends, which enables the short to identify to the SEC the account that shares were borrowed from. As soon as the report is sent in, the shares are returned to the broker dealer to be loaned to the next short. This allows eight to ten shorts to borrow the same shares, resetting the SHO–fail–to–deliver clock each time, which makes all of the counterfeit shares look like legitimate shares. The broker dealers charge each short for the stock lend.


Margin account buyers, because of loopholes in the rules, inadvertently aid the shorts. If short A sells a naked short he has three days to deliver a borrowed share. If the counterfeit share is purchased in a margin account, it is immediately put into the stock lend and, for a fee, is available as a borrowed share to the short who counterfeited it in the first place. This process is perpetually fluid with multiple parties, but it serves to create more counterfeit shares and is an example of how a counterfeit share gets “laundered” into a legitimate borrowed share.


Margin account agreements give the broker dealers the right to lend those shares without notifying the account owner. Shares held in cash accounts, IRA accounts and any restricted shares are not supposed to be loaned without express consent from the account owner. Broker dealers have been known to change cash accounts to margin accounts without telling the owner, take shares from IRA accounts, take shares from cash accounts and lend restricted shares. One of the prime brokers recently took a million shares from cash accounts of the company's founding investors without telling the owners or the stockbroker who represented ownership. The shares were put into the stock lend, which got the company off the SHO threshold list, and opened the door for more manipulative shorting.
This is a sample of tactics used. For a company that is under attack, the counterfeit shares that exist at this ex–clearing tier can be ten or twenty times the number of fails–to–deliver, which is the only category tracked and policed by the SEC.


Continuous Net Settlement — The third tier of counterfeiting occurs at the DTC level. The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) is a holding company owned by the major broker dealers, and has four subsidiaries. The subsidiaries that are of interest are the Depository Trust Company (DTC) and the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC). The DTC has an account for each broker dealer, which is further broken down to each customer of that broker dealer. These accounts are electronic entries. Ninety seven percent of the actual stock certificates are in the vault at the DTC with the DTC nominee's name on them. The NSCC processes transactions, provides the broker dealers with a central clearing source, and operates the stock borrow program.


When a broker dealer processes the sale of a short share, the broker dealer has three days to deliver a borrowed share to the purchaser and the purchaser has three days to deliver the money. In the old days, if the buyer did not receive his shares by settlement day, three days after the trade, he took his money back and undid the transaction. When the stock borrow program and electronic transfers were put in place in 1981, this all changed. At that point the NSCC guaranteed the performance of the buyers and sellers and would settle the transaction even though the seller was now a fail–to–deliver on the shares he sold. The buyer has a counterfeit share in his account, but the NSCC transacts it as if it were real.


At the end of each day, if a broker dealer has sold more shares of a given stock than he has in his account with the DTC, he borrows shares from the NSCC, who borrows them from the broker dealers who have a surplus of shares. So far it sounds like the whole system is in balance, and for any given stock the net number of shares in the DTC is equal to the number of shares issued by the company.
The short seller who has sold naked – he had no borrowed shares – can cure his fail–to–deliver position and avoid the required forced buy–in by borrowing the share through the NSCC stock borrow program.
Here is the hocus pocus that creates millions of counterfeit shares.


When a broker dealer has a net surplus of shares of any given company in his account with the DTC, only the net amount is deducted from his surplus position and put in the stock borrow program. However the broker dealer does not take a like number of shares from his customer's individual accounts. The net surplus position is loaned to a second broker dealer to cover his net deficit position.
Let's say a customer at the second broker dealer purchased shares from a naked short seller — counterfeit shares. His broker dealer “delivers” those shares to his account from the shares borrowed from the DTC. The lending broker dealer did not take the shares from any specific customers' account, but the borrowing broker dealer put the borrowed shares in specific customer's accounts. Now the customer at the second prime broker has “real” shares in his account. The problem is it's the same “real” shares that are in the customer's account at the first prime broker.
The customer account at the second prime broker now has a “real” share, which the prime broker can lend to a short who makes a short sale and delivers that share to a third party. Now there are three investors with the same counterfeit shares in their accounts.
Because the DTC stock borrow program, and the debits and credits that go back and forth between the broker dealers, only deals with the net difference, it never gets reconciled to the actual number of shares issued by the company. As long as the broker dealers don't repay the total stock borrowed and only settle their net differences, they can “grow” a company's issued stock.


This process is called Continuous Net Settlement (CNS) and it hides billions of counterfeit shares that never make it to the Reg. SHO radar screen, as the shares “borrowed” from the DTC are treated as a legitimate borrowed shares.
For companies that are under attack, the counterfeit shares that are created by the CNS program are thought to be ten or twenty times the disclosed fails–to–deliver, and the true CNS totals are only obtained by successfully serving the DTC with a subpoena. The SEC doesn't even get this information. The actual process is more complex and arcane than this, but the end result is accurately depicted.
Ex–clearing and CNS counterfeiting are used to create an enormous reserve of counterfeit shares. The industry refers to these as “strategic fails–to–deliver.” Most people would refer to these as a stockpile of counterfeit shares that can be used for market manipulation. One emerging company for which we have been able to get or make reasonable estimates of the total short interest, the disclosed short interest, the available stock lend and the fails–to–deliver, has fifty “buried” counterfeit shares for every fail–to–deliver share, which is the only thing that the SEC tracks, consequently the SEC has not acted on shareholder complaints that the stock is being manipulated.

The Anatomy of a Short Attack — Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.
The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.
When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.


Typical tactics include the following:
Flooding the offer side of the board — Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.


The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.


By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of “strategic fails-to-deliver” and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will “mask” the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.


Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other “success” parameters, the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands — all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.


Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called “crashing” the stock and a successful “crash” is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash “stick” or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:
Media assault — The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately purchase real shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These real shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.


The shorts have “friendly” reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the “friendly” reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.


One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair — proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This “mistake” was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation “Due to a mathematical error” appeared three days later — after the damage was done to the stock price.
Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:
When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fictionâ€¦ you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down — it's a pretty good game.


This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air, however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.


Analyst Reports — Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned “friendly” media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.


Planting moles in target companies — The shorts plant “moles” inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.
Frivolous SEC investigations — The shorts “leak” tips to the SEC about “corporate malfeasance” by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed “confidential inquiry” is leaked to the short media.


The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.
Class Action lawsuits — Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.
Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. — If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.
Pulling margin from long customers — The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover.
Paid bashers — The shorts will hire paid bashers who “invade” the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation.

This is not every dirty trick that the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.

TL;DR
These funds will short sell the same shares over and over increasing the amount of “conterfeit shares” and they will use all their power to use media to divert attention from illegal activities

The media is intentionally leaving out all the positive transformation information that is going on inside Game Stop.  What am I talking about you might ask.  Let me ask everyone this:  If there was a company that was experiencing 300% yoy ecommerce growth, closing unprofitable stores, start of a new console cycle, heading into a 200 billion TAM computer gaming industry and oh yeah, three new board members including Ryan Cohen would you say, ""Hey this company has a great future?""   I'm pretty sure most investors would.

I know  everyone is looking for the big squeeze and you fucking retarded apes have done fantastic holding the line, however, there is a great long term story about to unfold here.  The current tradeable float is probably less than 10 million shares, more than likely closer to 5 million.  The institutions own over 100% and the current BUY AND HOLD strategy is working like a charm.  The hedge funds, market makers and brokerages have engaged in criminal activity to hold the stock down.  My point is, the company and Cohen hasn't said a word due to earnings coming up 3/25/21.  Just think what the stock might do if/when CEO Sherman steps aside and they announce Cohen as CEO.  Then Cohen announces his plan of how he's going to transform the company.  This is why I haven't sold along with the fact that I'm just a retarded ape like everyone else, but I really just like the stock.

Moral of the story is JUST BUY AND HOLD and good things are in our future."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|['GME', 'MUST', 'READ']|['GME']|['I', 'I', 'TAM', 'I', 'BUY', 'AND', 'HOLD', 'CEO', 'CEO', 'I', 'I', 'JUST', 'BUY', 'AND', 'HOLD']|[]

Many people don't seem to realize it, but no smart investors put all their eggs into one basket.

I've got multiple large bets going at any given time, this way, if one doesn't work out, I can always bank on another one.

&#x200B;

That said, here's why I decided to put 100k into $NOK.

*This is not financial advice, do your own DD.*

&#x200B;

Let's start with financials:

The company has been working to grow FCF (Free cash flow) for the past couple of years and have delivered 5 quarters of positive FCF so far. Expected to continue this quarter.

Their operating margins have improved from breakeven in 2018 to just over 9% in 2020.

They are siting on a total cash balance of **over 8 billion dollars.**

The market cap is 23 billion dollars. To put this in perspective. You're paying 4.90$ per share for 1.92$ in Cash + Nokia's assets.

The company's expected to reinstate their dividend.

We're paying \~1x sales to buy the company.

The board is authorized to issue or buy back up to 10% of the float. They have done neither.

&#x200B;

**The other reasons:**

The Covid pandemic has actually accellerated spending on 5G infrastructure. $NOK and Ericsson have been large beneficiaries of this due to the security risks related to Huauei.

$NOK's reefshark chips help carriers reduce their costs (power demand is 64% lower for example). This has helped them sell more of their products, but they don't expect full adoption until 2022.

$NOK's been investing their money into R&D as well as into turning things around. They aren't just sitting on the side, they are working to become a major player again.

Total addressable market for this is expected to be $700 billion by 2030. It's currently $10 billion.

This is a 70x increase in addressable market, for which there are only a few major players.

**The biggest risk:** Huauei is unbanned from use in the US.

 

**TLDR:** 

My positions: 20k shares, with an average cost of about 4.75$. I will be selling weekly covered calls at varying strikes, to take advantage of the high IV. I'm happy to be paid to wait."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|['DD', '$NOK']|['NOK']|['$NOK', '$GME', 'I', 'I', '$NOK', 'DD', 'FCF', 'FCF', 'G', '$NOK', 'D', 'US', 'I', 'IV']|['NOK', 'GME', 'NOK', 'NOK']

We're in a war with the hedge funds and with wallstreet and basically the root of corruption in America with our GME short squeeze proxy war, and if you autists want to win this war, you need to know the enemy, and know yourself.Firstly, education is KEY, so if you're new, you DEFINITELY need to go learn at least what a short squeeze is and a short ladder attack is.

What the enemy is doing:

1. ***Price manipulation:*** With short ladder attacks, they use high frequency trading to make the price artificially lower.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4pji/gme\_volume\_still\_low\_with\_positive\_cmf\_which/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4pji/gme_volume_still_low_with_positive_cmf_which/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la5upr/dont\_panic\_and\_just\_look\_at\_the\_fucking\_volume/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la5upr/dont_panic_and_just_look_at_the_fucking_volume/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laak53/for\_those\_of\_you\_getting\_scared\_look\_at\_that\_tiny/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laak53/for_those_of_you_getting_scared_look_at_that_tiny/)This can be seen with sizeable price movements that have tiny amounts of volume. There are several reasons why they are doing this:
   1. Scare off paper hand bitches: They prey on people who jumped on GME without even knowing what a short squeeze is; they see price fall, they paper hands and they get out.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall\_street\_plan\_trying\_to\_psychologically\_scare/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall_street_plan_trying_to_psychologically_scare/)
   2. Make it cheaper for them to cover their more costly short positions.
   3. Price manipulation will fail ultimately because while they are able to drive prices lower with their short attacks, when they eventually have to cover their short positions and buy, they will again drive prices up due to purchases of almost none existing stock (cuz we be holding), sending prices up as high as before they shorted or even higher. All the while hedge funds will continue to eat fees and interest on their short positions, making this cycle not doable indefinitely.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7bhj/gme\_mms\_have\_until\_tomorrow\_22\_to\_buy\_shares\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7bhj/gme_mms_have_until_tomorrow_22_to_buy_shares_it/)
2. ***Media manipulation***
   1. Most if not all American main stream media is clearly serving corporate and wallstreet interests, simply by the false narratives they are reporting.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1022/hmmm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1022/hmmm/)They are not to be trusted and if seen, can dishearten and shake the will of those who don't have diamond hands. Best to avoid if you are a paper handed bitch. Some examples of false narratives are:
      1. Reddit is made up of alt-rights, or idiots, or gamblers, etc. -> We're not idiots, because we're the ones who were able to grab wallstreet by the nutsack. We're retards and autists who love the stock and the company. That is all.
      2. Reddit is moving on to silver. -> SILVER CANNOT BE SQUEEZED!!!!! With a market cap of more than $1.5 Trillion, there is NO WAY for retail investors to be able to make a dent in that. The only possible short squeeze play is GME because it's a small cap company with a market cap of only $250 million as of July 2020, so it is definitely doable for a bunch of retards on WSB to affect the price of a small cap company stock. Literally all the posts on reddit promoting SLVR are from bot accounts that have sus creation dates and karma and post counts. Plus, Citadel owns a giant amount of silver so silver prices going up higher is gonna benefit them and give them more fuel to fight this GME war. You're shooting yourself int eh foot if you buy SLVR. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1xhf/guess\_who\_owns\_tonnes\_of\_slv\_options\_fuck\_citadel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1xhf/guess_who_owns_tonnes_of_slv_options_fuck_citadel/)
      3. ""XXX IS THE NEXT GME"" -> This is also a false narrative. NOTHING can be the next GME, because NOTHING is shorted as much as GME, which is STILL over 100% shorted. GME IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY GAIN FOR US, AND LOSS FOR THEM!
      4. Shorts have covered their position. -> Another false narrative. Short interest is still over at 100%, and there are multiple WSB posts that explain this. Another metric that correlates to short interest is cost of borrowing for opening short positions, which would increase if it is harder to find shares to short.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7d94/no\_more\_shares\_to\_short/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7d94/no_more_shares_to_short/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laaai8/gme\_short\_interest\_is\_currently\_sitting\_at\_12297/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laaai8/gme_short_interest_is_currently_sitting_at_12297/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5d6sk/gme\_short\_interest\_increased\_to\_7141m\_after\_jan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5d6sk/gme_short_interest_increased_to_7141m_after_jan/)
3. ***Breaking the law:*** Some if not all of the things posted above are pretty much border line illegal, but there has been clear signs of breaking the law and market manipulation, IE: freeze buying of select stocks and only allow for selling. They can spin it however they want, but as far as I know, it has been unprecedented for a majority of brokerages to simultaneously alter the way a stock can be traded with cash. And if the situation is desparate enough, they'll break the law again and again if it ends up costing them less than to just let the price get to $69.420. Expect them to fight dirty until the bitter end.
4. ***Social Media Manipulation:*** Hedge Funds now employ bots to spread doubt and misinformation in order to weaken your hands. Some places they target is WSB itself, other stock trading subreddits, facebook, and on sites / apps like Webull and Yahoo Finance. Don't believe in random comments. Always believe in WSB posts with huge amounts of likes (top posts are vetted by the 8 mil users here / by mods too to make sure they're factual)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafh4d/in\_case\_you\_needed\_proof\_that\_there\_are\_imposters/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafh4d/in_case_you_needed_proof_that_there_are_imposters/)
5. ***Their Current Strategy:*** Wallstreet calls us ""dumb money"", because they think we are unsophisticated and just chase after a quick buck, and we have short attention spans. They'll try and continue to manipulate the price so that the stock will trade sideways, or continuous short ladder attacks, trying to scare paper hands into selling, and bore diamond hands into selling as well. They will also try to tempt us with other ""NEXT GME"" type plays and may even artificially raise prices of a stock or two (IE: SILVER) to try and get people to hop off the GME rocket. They'll use media to continue to push narratives that the GME short squeeze is over, short positions are covered, and redditors have moved onto something else. If this fails, then they may simulate a ""SQUEEZE"" by suddenly letting the price go up to $700 or $800, then unleash a short ladder attack unlike which we have ever seen, to simulate the sell off, so idiot retards will be scared into thinking they missed the top, so they will all sell. But if people just look at the volume, they'll know it's all a ruse.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What we're doing, our advantage, and why the enemy can't win.

1. ***This is a movement:*** This has become more than a few people of a subreddit trying to make a quickbuck off of a short squeeze. This has become a movement that represents the struggle between the corruption of wallstreet and the 1% vs the 99%, the common people. News agencies from all over the globe are reporting on this and have their eyes on this. We have ape brothers and sisters all over the world buying and holding this stock together. We even have a few outspoken whales on our side as well, as well as politicians from both sides of the spectrum speaking out for our side as well. We have billboards being bought all over the country, airplanes flying banners about GME. A global movement will crush any hedge fund.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5mt6n/gme\_short\_squeeze\_the\_whales\_have\_arrived/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5mt6n/gme_short_squeeze_the_whales_have_arrived/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qtey/kjetill\_stjerne\_is\_da\_real\_mvp\_he\_his\_friends\_are/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qtey/kjetill_stjerne_is_da_real_mvp_he_his_friends_are/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rf4k/times\_square\_right\_now/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rf4k/times_square_right_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
2. ***We are holding, and we're continuing to buy:*** We are getting smarter, tougher, and slowly but surely paper hands are turning into diamond hands. We managed to hold during the short attack to \~$110 on Thursday, and that was when they froze our ability to buy across many brokerages. They will never have another chance to do this again now with everyone watching. The volume trading these days is getting smaller and smaller. Any price decrease is strictly from short ladder attacks, and not us selling, due to tiny tiny volumes. Also, we are continuing to buy calls on GME to increase upward pressure. No one here has stopped buying. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labvei/volume\_is\_low\_dont\_believe\_the\_news\_no\_one\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labvei/volume_is_low_dont_believe_the_news_no_one_is/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l83ctf/the\_volume\_of\_gme\_has\_plummeted\_the\_past\_few\_days/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l83ctf/the_volume_of_gme_has_plummeted_the_past_few_days/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lagd2m/millions\_in\_gme\_calls\_bought\_today\_at\_800\_hold/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lagd2m/millions_in_gme_calls_bought_today_at_800_hold/)
3. ***Nuclear Bomb still undetonated***\*:\* Short Squeeze still coming, it hasn't happened yet. We know this because the volume of shares bought is not nearly enough to show the shorts have bought enough to be covered.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1q9hy/l2\_nyse\_quotes\_for\_gme\_volume\_the\_squeeze\_hasnt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1q9hy/l2_nyse_quotes_for_gme_volume_the_squeeze_hasnt/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l66kcl/gme\_volume\_is\_low\_shorts\_arent\_covering\_hold/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l66kcl/gme_volume_is_low_shorts_arent_covering_hold/)
4. ***Enemy loses money everyday, we don't:*** It costs the hedge funds billions to continue to fight this war of attrition becauase they continue to eat insanely high fees and interest on their short positions because the cost of borrowing remains high because the short interest are remaining high. Melvin down over 50% just this month alone. You think they can hold on much longer and keep eating fees?[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labq1a/this\_is\_so\_satisfying\_to\_look\_at/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labq1a/this_is_so_satisfying_to_look_at/)Meanwhile we don't have to pay anything for holding our stocks. We can literally just hold and not have a short squeeze and just from the cost of borrowing alone the hedge funds will run out of money, so that's why there will come a time where it's cheaper for them to cover their positions rather than just keep on bleeding until they die out. I don't think they can hold out for another month of trading sideways with no progress. I believe in Feb we will see some major action. It could even start as early as tomorrow, because that's the last day shorts have to cover their 1/29 puts that expired.
5. ***We're not breaking the laws, they are:*** Recent rumor mills are saying that there are a lot of [counterfit stocks](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) circulating and the hedge funds and clearing houses are all in on it, and once they need to start to find shares to buy to cover their short positions, things are going to explode in a way that is unprecedented. Basically by taking advantage of a situation wallstreet has set up (insane short interest set up for short squeeze) we may have uncovered one of the biggest financial crimes in the history of the stock market.

7. ***An Ape's Move this week:*** Again, not financial advice, but hypothetically if there was an autistic ape, the autistic ape would buy the dips, ESPECIALLY at this insane discount price of around $100. The autistic ape knows that basically it is paying $100 for a ticket to ride the GME train past $1k, easily 10x their bananas. Those apes who bought in at $300 will only get to 3x their bananas at the end of the month. The autistic apes will also understand that this is not a 1 day thing, but the events leading up to the squeeze can take weeks. But the autistic ape will ask itself, is it willing to wait a few weeks to at least 3x their bananas? Most apes will answer yes. But the ape knows if they buy it, they should be prepared to see red in their banana tracker for a month. But those red number are just fake numbers generated by HFT short ladder attacks, and not due to other apes actually selling their bananas, because apes together STRONK.

We wanted to reach out to you after a transformative week in the markets to answer a question we know many of you are asking: “Why did Robinhood limit certain stocks?”   


We understand that the temporary limits we placed on certain stocks this past week were frustrating for many, especially since we built Robinhood to expand access to investing. We have always sought to put our customers first and we want you to be able to invest on your own terms.   


To help explain what happened and why we had to take action, we wrote [**a letter to our customers**](http://sg.robinhood.com/ls/click?upn=6fntGirSE5selsQKrSSUHh6lgFyOgotlCTJW8UC1di71-2FN8W9HLDeGxWC4U5aEavH91h1h75nfEoi40O-2BJp241os1OXbwqcvqJ1wx8fRtdZa4yPHJd3VaV9ZmuiW1Y8kIkOs_0QWL-2FCUCqlU7jIqxpPSB9OxM9FRLms8ed02eETm0XmLyPxEEZ9Yx1osF-2F2Olc0X95ijU64uSuhF1vPTW00ASBRnRYzE5nDEQo9kVCzyEPt6JRUURrNQwUEmhfgeIfRCW86mSXVtX2-2BS9LhHDNVmjdC8lpjCulKPt7v9hOTXzII645jTe2IqLIFCc-2BmHCi-2BVQ0W0yUI6HviMaE33-2BukVQvcPGCCZWjFtJsTSMS75-2BCmQbOmWbm8feSSdfOQpH08fSwx12NTBbXE46HOsa1cV-2F8j-2FJeCqDt-2BXbwuLJgrJb24pZiEuECgjY5seWaf5QttGF) and captured the key understandings for you below:

* For Robinhood to operate, we must meet clearinghouse deposit requirements to support customer trades.
* Deposit requirements are determined in part by how much stock a firm’s customers hold. If a firm’s customers’ holdings are volatile, a broker (in this instance Robinhood) is obligated to meet higher deposit requirements.
* Last week, in part due to [**volatility**](http://sg.robinhood.com/ls/click?upn=6fntGirSE5selsQKrSSUHmU2zwU4-2BFOOGZok1-2F2HV-2Fzt4c20N8xojDAhUgt8a3TK7RBIb22WdVUS4CSdTwvVnbL52f-2Bl-2B207nVUod7i4WaLCWuNNQ0d6ZEsoYQX1fJMiDjMpPyfpE5mx0X2MvnOeoHr6A6U-2FzwqHV0iErJeKPLQ-3DnV5W_0QWL-2FCUCqlU7jIqxpPSB9OxM9FRLms8ed02eETm0XmLyPxEEZ9Yx1osF-2F2Olc0X9VYayMHndG9bc69FjYlFlBsnTLvcEmpwFADktwS-2FAiCthQb5eIXGICHKIXTUooIxlznBo2QuHSt5fTyQSM3bWTvOlnZ5Rw0HejdBRUuBqCDvGDfDHVW2FT32HtCv3394-2BPZT3FpK3djP6sjWKPDsfK-2FuGZEQcZOAkV7VomUXBokliAnU4rdpoYGDbxHrKZD8NZbgtcmYBc9NKzZWO4dxsyP4nguFNZ-2BMW8EJK39Dh6Rf2xHhOpvmykRfeKuPL-2BnQU) in some popular stocks, Robinhood’s deposit requirements rose tenfold. The combination of the deposit increase and the extraordinary increase in volume on these particular symbols led us to put temporary buying restrictions in place on a small number of those stocks. 
* We had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile stocks to ensure we could comfortably meet our deposit obligations. **We didn’t want to stop people from buying stocks and we certainly weren’t trying to help hedge funds**. 

We hope you take away this: **at Robinhood, we stand with everyday investors participating in the markets**. Standing by our Robinhood community means being there for our customers through any trading environment. We’ll continue to improve as we break down barriers in the financial system to open it for all.

**Hostess Brands (TWNK)** has high (\~15%) short interest (more than AMC or BB) setting the stage for a short squeeze, additional upside from a gamma squeeze, is extremely memeable, AND has a fundamentally sound business with strong cash flows and organic growth trading at a reasonable valuation. ***Not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade.***

# Intro

Sup guys. So I know a bunch of us are now looking for the next big opportunity to pile into. Unfortunately we probably won’t see a squeeze of GME’s magnitude for awhile since that kind of short interest is insanely rare, but I think we might have found an opportunity that is pretty low hanging fruit AND is significantly better relative value than the other names people are piling into. It has what the finance community call “asymmetric upside” (more upside potential than downside risk), for the reasons I’ll describe below.

**So what’s the target?** ***Hostess Brands (NASDAQ: TWNK)***. You probably know them as the company that makes Twinkies, but they also make Cupcakes, DingDongs, HoHos, Donettes and Zingers (can’t make this up)…now they’re going to make us some Tendies™ as well.

For some historical context, the company was private-equity owned for awhile and then went public via a SPAC in 2016 (before SPAC's were as cool as they are today). The previous owners have fully sold out now, so the entire shares outstanding are pretty much public float today and there’s no more downward pressure on the stock price from their share sales.

The company also has warrants from the SPAC (effectively long-dated call options) that trade under TWNKW. They trade as half warrants, so need two warrants to form one share and are ITM at $11.50 per one full share and expire in November 2021.

**So what’s the thesis?** We think there’s an opportunity to wring out the short sellers in this name and potentially even further upside from a gamma squeeze if we can get enough call option volume. From a fundamental standpoint, the business is extremely stable (as it was a pretty ideal candidate for an LBO), and trades at a slight discount to its peers.

# Technical Thesis

1. **High short interest = squeeze opportunity** – Roughly 15% short interest today, higher than AMC which is last reported at 10-15% (see end of post for reference) and BB at 5-10%. This seems low in comparison to GME, but again this company has no structural problems that we’re aware of (can’t really say the same for movie theaters or mall-based retailers right now) and has actually been performing pretty well. Also, anything above 20% short interest is considered pretty high in the normal world. This level of short interest on a solid business smells like opportunity to squeeze out a couple of greedy hedge funds.
2. **Limited liquidity and trading volume will make it difficult for shorts to cover** – Average 3-month daily trading volume of 1.4mm shares (roughly 1% of the float). It would take about *13+ DAYS* for the shorts to fully cover if they were to buy up all the average daily trading volume. Current $2bn market cap is also in the perfect sweet spot for the WSB pool of capital (especially since many of us have our tendies tied up in GME right now). If you’re looking for a bit of tendie diversification, this is the name.
3. **The potential for a Gamma squeeze is all further upside** – There’s actually been option activity picking up on this company. ***On Friday, Nasdaq reported that call options for 2.6mm of underlying shares traded hands on TWNK. This is with limited mention of TWNK online thus far (based on my keyword search through reddit)****.* See [this report](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-friday-option-activity%3A-twnk-wdc-nvcr-2021-01-29). Most of those options were sold OTM at the $17.50 strike price. Things are moving quick here and we might not be the only ones that have sniffed out this opportunity. In order to create the biggest upside, buying the highest strike call option is ideal. As the price moves closer to ITM on those options, the market makers will have to buy more shares to hedge. The IV is still really low on this name.

# Fundamental Thesis

1. **Snacking continues to be king.** Large market, resilient, growing. 95% of U.S. adults snack daily, and the average American snacks 3x-5x per day. The snacking category generates \~$150bn in annual sales and is expected to continue growing mid-single-digits driven by the need for convenience as consumers (at least pre-COVID-19) are busier than ever. Lots of room for multiple winners in the industry, of which I think Hostess will continue to be one.
2. **Strong organic growth story**. Organic sales have grown \~6% per year on average over the last number of years. Hostess Brands is growing – and likely gaining share.
3. **Strong brand value and nostalgia factor with millennials.** Some of you might be old enough to remember this but during 2012, when the company filed for bankruptcy (due to the heavy debt burden from its buyout), consumers freaked out that the company would discontinue production of their beloved Twinkies, triggering a mad scramble to buy up all available supply of Twinkies. ***At the peak Twinkies sold on Ebay for $22,000 (see article*** [***here***](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/on-ebay-the-starting-bid-for-a-single-twinkie-is-now-5-000/265346/)***).***
4. **The acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 rides the healthy snack trend.** Voortman sells crème wafers and sugar free cookies (new product categories for Hostess), and markets as having no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup, and no trans-fat (playing the “better-for-you” snack trend). Voortman is one of the fastest growing independent sweet snacking brands of scale in North America, and should be able to accelerate growth by leveraging Hostess’ existing distribution footprint.
5. **COVID-19 re-opening should drive a bounce-back in convenience store traffic, which is the company’s primary sales channel and may also increase demand as consumers become busy again (and thus snack more).** Management plans to keep growing within the convenience store channel, which is a growing end-market and should rebound as the world re-opens. As consumers get back to their busy pre-COVID-19 lives, they may also go back to snacking more out of convenience.

# Potential Risks

1. **Changing consumer preferences, especially to healthy.** The recent acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 allows Hostess to further capitalize on the healthy trend.
2. **Pretty high leverage for a public company.** They have roughly $950mm of net debt, or \~4x leverage on Adj. EBITDA (Adj. EBITDA is a proxy for cash flow). This is pretty high leverage for a public company (but quite low in private equity land). Leverage increased to \~4.5x in the beginning of 2020 after the acquisition of Voortman Cookies (up from \~3.4x before the acquisition), but has steadily declined to \~4x today as Adj. EBITDA has grown. Given their cash flow profile, would not be surprised to see them continue to deleverage.
3. **Customer concentration.** The Company’s largest customer is Walmart, which was \~24% of sales. Top ten customers accounted for \~62% of sales in 2019. Some risk with customer concentration, but Hostess Brands is such a well-known and entrenched brand that I don’t think retail stores will do anything irrational.
4. **Rebound of COVID-19.** Risk that COVID-19 cases rise again, possibly hurting traffic and sales through retail stores, increasing costs, or causing supply chain disruptions. On the flip side, the snack category seems to have held steady from consumers staying at home and snacking more.

# Conclusion

If you’re looking for a little tendie diversification or finding the next oversold stock, look no further. This stacks up as a much better opportunity than AMC or BB given the higher short interest and more stable business fundamentals. Also, we can also potentially create even more upside with a gamma squeeze if we are able to buy more call options at the high strike prices.

***Again, this is not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade (and hopefully does not require much capital). Bringing this to your attention now before it starts to trade away from us or before the hedge funds exit their shorts. More than happy to hear any feedback from you guys.***"|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082633.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['DR', 'AMC', 'AND', 'LDING', 'THE', 'LINE', 'ON', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'AND', 'SPAC', 'SPAC', 'TWNKW', 'ITM', 'AMC', 'BB', 'GME', 'WSB', 'GME', 'TWNK', 'TWNK', 'OTM', 'ITM', 'IV', 'U', 'S', 'I', 'BITDA', 'BITDA', 'BITDA', 'I', 'TWNK', 'TWNK', 'TWNK', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'I', 'AMC', 'BB', 'LDING', 'THE', 'LINE', 'ON', 'GME']|['AMC', 'GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'GME']

FireEye has the best incidence response for cyber attacks in the USA and were contracted heavily during the SolarWinds attack tens to hundreds of companies last quarter. They have seen some rougher quarters while dealing with debt and company reorganizations. They should post above expected earning this quarter which are released tomorrow after hours. Call options don't have crazy premiums right now especially for the ones expiring end of the week. (Feb 12 exp, 24 strike for $0.94 right now).

Cybersecurity is becoming more valuable and WS is catching on. Incident response, a part of cybersecurity uses multiple technologies and does not get outdated as it is the process of figuring out how an entity was attacked and doing remediation's on that.

I just turned 27 last week right when this all started and for my birthday I got a knife in the back from Vlad Tenev, Robinhood and the suits. 

I almost didn’t go to school because of money struggles growing up. It took me six years to get my bachelors degree: first community college then transferred to a university. I graduated two years ago and I’ve been struggling to find a stable job and Covid did not help. I went through many interviews this year, but was denied over and over or positions were dissolved mid-way through the hiring process because of company redirection. It has really sucked, and I’m sure many of you have gone through same thing. 

For nearly 2 months I was hovering around $100 in bank account and doing grub-hub to pay for my bills. In October I started working in a distribution center...busting my ass until I get a career role. Fortunately, I am in another interview process for an awesome company and position.

I know it’s irresponsible of me to throw everything I’ve made over the past few months into these companies. But I believe in what is happening and this community. This is bigger than money. What the suits have done is unforgivable. Although I am still up pretty well, it does look bad right now, but we still don’t know what’s gonna happen. I’ve come to terms with the potential loss and all the work I’ve done to get here, but I am HOLDING.

I have been in way worse financial positions and I’ve always made it out. Robinhood chose not to do what was right. I will be okay and you will be okay. 

Do what you must.
Money will come and go. See this through.
Keep those diamond hands.

This is not financial advice I just like the stock and love you all.

I am also not a financial advisor.

Context Logic Inc, ticker WISH, is a stable, competitive alternative to Ali-Express, that has (since IPO) seen a steady incline despite market fluctuations. 

With record unemployment: [https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/10/business/unemployment-long-term-pandemic/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/10/business/unemployment-long-term-pandemic/index.html)

And Biden's plan to ""buy American"" paired with a new, stirred sense of patriotism amongst the lower to middle class, there is going to be an overwhelming influx of cheap, low cost, alternative household and every day goods. Now you're thinking, why don't they just go to amazon? Amazon's prices would be preferred had we not been in the midst of a pandemic and economic recession. The alternative to going broke is budgeting effectively, and we do that by slapping on the American brand name over cheap overseas goods. Does it matter where it was made if its from an American company? The vast majority of people wouldn't bother checking or caring.

Improving free cash flow in 2020 compared to 2019? Check. Monthly active user growth rising nicely? Yes. Active buyers up compared to the year-ago period? Yep.

After a significantly underperforming IPO, in my humble opinion, the company is a 6-8 bagger by EOY.

This is simply my perspective as an options trader on the current situation with GME. Many of you will hate my perspective. You will call me a (insert rainbow + bear emoji (I am write these on word so yeah)), you will tell me to fuck off and drag me through the mud. But all I am trying to do here is provide this growing community with some original and well thought out due diligence and research on a very popular invesment that many of you have sunk your life savings into. And sometimes you have to go against the grain to help a community see a different perspective. 

I also want to say that I am extremely proud of this sub. This sub has done something that no other sub has done on reddit or any social media platform for that matter. However, this is a sub that was built on Due Diligence, Degenerate Trading, and Crazy Gains and Loss Porn. And to see this sub shine a light on a clearly broken system is something to be truly proud of. 

However, the time may have come to realize that we were indeed robbed of the MOASS. Which it absolutely tears me up inside to say so. This was going to be by far one of the greater events to occur in the history of assets management and trading. I for one was loaded to the hilt in call options and ready to rumble just like many of you. And like many of you I made multiples of my salary within the first few weeks of January, it is life changing money. 

There is an old saying in the industry and within trading, that you “Ride the trade, until it doesn’t make sense anymore”. And I am afraid to that we could either be fast approaching this or have even passed it at this point. So below you will find my technical analysis on GME and why I feel like it might continue its downward trend. This is of course is subject to change, and just my observations. I hope this helps some with a better understanding of what is going on and how to read the charts (Technical Analysis). 

My Technical Analysis approach: I am an intermediate term momentum trader. This simply means that I am trying to trade for the next 5-15 days. The tools I use are the following:

· RSI: Measures the strength of the movement or the strength of the momentum.

· MACD: This is trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price, and helps you understand the momentum of a stock

· Volume: Speaks for itself

· MVWAP & SMA: Helps Identify intermediate term trend and takes into consideration by comparing to shorter-term trend. (MVWAP: Pink Line, SMA: Teal Line)

I usually use a mix of the 15 & 30 Minute chart paired with the 1 Hour to identify patterns within the market.

Chart (A): Below you will find the 15-minute chart, that spreads over the past five days of trading. Each data point represents a 15-minute segment of trading. The Black shaded areas represent the trading session and the grey shaded area represent pre-market and after-hours trading. 

&#x200B;

[Chart \(A\) 15 minute intervals](https://preview.redd.it/lay0kxbpdye61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0639aa416de5f96a4228d5e8b4cb7fa3b5c3d973)

Tuesday of Chart(A) shows extremely bullish pattern being built late Tuesday afternoon and continued into the afterhours. This was the culmination of Papa Elon, and Camath chipping in their two cents on twitter, along with a clear series of purchases by institutional buyers (This very well could have been Melvin and the early shorts covering their positions). Additionally we can see that the VWAP and SMA are diverging further apart (Bulllish). The MACD is showing the same as well, with the Histogram showing no signs of slowing down as well (Bullish). And despite an onslaught of short attacks and put ladders during trading on Wednesday we still managed to end the day “Green”. However, we can see that the volume drove itself right off a cliff, and we all know what happened there after. 

Ever since the security price has shown an increased amount of volatility and the bid / ask spread continues to widen throughout every trading session. Clearly the market makers are not doing their job in creating a market for the stock and/or there is blatant fuckery going on behind the scenes. Either way it does spell bad news for the underlying security. 

Furthermore, we can see that during the Thursday trading session that three bearish events occur; 1) the MVWAP and SMA begin to diverge, 2)MACD Plummets with a bearish signal line crossover, and 3) The RSI Plummets to sold territory as well. 

To further support my hypothesis, I have included the 1 Hour chart as well

&#x200B;

[Chart \(B\) 1 Hour Trading Intervals](https://preview.redd.it/3gt2em3rdye61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbe04b217967c20a258e4e9ad1606ee6ec3dbed0)

As we can see above the same sort of patterns that developed in the short term are now present in the long term (1 hour Chart). Only this time we can see how the patterns are drawn out over a longer period (1 hour intervals), and thus it may give us a better sense of where we might be heading. At this time, we can see that the MVWAP and SMA have tapered out and are possibly at the beginning stages of divergence. That the RSI has neared “oversold” territory (anything below 30 is considered oversold). And finally, the longer term MACD is showing that the momentum is being carried to the downside.  

As I said earlier, “You ride the trade until it doesn’t make sense anymore”. And based off my research I can no longer say that it makes sense to be positioned for the upside. Which is why on Friday I started to trim most of my positions in GME, it simply made no more sense to me to remain on the bullish side of this security. Today I trimmed the remaining bits and will be walking away from GME at this time. 

I hope I am wrong. I hope this stock can reverse and we can go back to the fucking moon. I would be more than happy to dump a bunch of money to help build another Gamma Ramp. But right now, from my point of view that is not where we are.

Again, these are just my observations and I know a lot of you will find this offensive. But if you are going to trade or invest, you have to remove your emotions from the picture. Be a fucking robot. 

For those that are going to ask the trading platform I use is Think or Swim.

Slv etf is not like other stocks. They can create and retire shares at will.

The way it works is authorized investors are able to buy baskets of 50k shares in exchange for the equivalent delivery of silver bullion. 

This delivery to the slv trust creates shares. 

These authorized participants can also buy 50k shares and retire them in exchange for silver bullion withdrawal.

If the etf becomes over valued, an authorized participant can buy silver on the open market (or go to their vault where they have the physical silver purchased already at a lower price) and deliver it to slv trust to receive 50k shares which they can then sell at the over valued market price risk free Arbitrage.

As ive been sitting today from market opening and looking at [numbers like this](https://imgur.com/a/420z1fN) for hours on end having my small Rainman moment, ive noticed that a lot of those trades had 3 or 4 decimals, which indicates that those trades couldnt have been done by us retards.

Anyways, 1989 trades made between 3.30-4.00 p.m today had 3/4 decimals which tells us that at least **48,99%** couldnt have been made by retail. Also not every Fund will buy/sell with 3/4 decimals, so we can probably assume the number to be higher.

Well i dont know shit about shit, but it still looks like we are holding strong and they are just still postponing the inevitable.

1. On Wednesday, Hedge fund saw that they might go belly up and lose the billions. The only solution they saw was to restrict retail traders, who trade on Robinhood overwhelmingly. They asked in whispers IF Robinhood should put restrictions on these stocks. The reason can be formulated by the team of lawyers later. They knew very well this will upset the retail traders and might create an exodus of retail customers from Robinhood.
2. Hedge funds have few hundreds of millions in investment in Robinhood. HF realized it's okay to lose millions and save billions. HF might lose everything if the stocks ($GME etc.) continue to the ride to the moon. Hence the blockade.

This is a classic example of when Robinhood could stand up for us to the bullies and say

 TIMES UP ITS TIME FOR DEMOCRATIZATION

 But they didn't and here we are.

**Why no spike today?**:

First of all, we can’t know on what day the Squeeze happens / they cover their shorts. 
All we know is it has to happen sooner or later since the hedgefunds are losing millions if not billions EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY DON’T COVER. 
They use several tactics to delay it, but they can’t circumvent it.
They’re bleeding, and all the retail investors holding are slowly sucking the blood out of their fat ugly bodies.

It might take just a few days, or weeks...
But eventually, when they cover, WE retail investors get to set the price.
That’s why you keep seeing 10k (or 69420$) is not a meme. Because it’s not.

We also know they’re down BAD. Why?
Because they’re attacking us any way they can and wasting millions doing so.

So let’s see what tactics they are using:

**Short ladder attacks**:

What is a short ladder attack? 
The big hedgefunds are putting in lower and lower bid prices between themselves. There is little to no volume on those trades, and since no one can buy, it ""looks"" like the stock is plummeting. It’s only effective if we would sell.

**Infiltrating WSB and other social media**:

Here are some random screenshots I took of WSB Synth. Notice the people saying to jump ship and to take GME gains and invest into FORD. Obvious shills. There’s tons of them. Always new, or old accounts that suddenly post again. All those people came in just in time when the short ladder attacks started, just to make it look like people are panic selling and convince us to sell:

**Manipulating the Media**: 

Here are some News channels caught lying / manipulating the market: (SEC if you read this...)
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8n7o/fake_news/
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6e16/cnn_back_off_this_is_a_lie_literally_a_5_second/

Now let’s get some clarification on **SILVER:**

There is so much misinformation swirling around concerning Silver. People don’t seem to realize 3 things:

1. **Silver is not a get rich quick move. Silver is a LONG TERM HOLD move.** GME is a risky short term play. So YOU decide what makes more sense to get in right now. (Personally I sold all my stocks to buy GME today. YOLO) 
2. The actual Silver sub on reddit does not advocate buying SLV, nor do most of them believe SLV is the move to make. 
3. The hedge funds would love for you to go all-in on Silver and ignore the GME opportunity. Every dollar spent on SLV instead of GME is a double win for them, since SLV is inverting GME and they own a ton of Silver and that’s why they’re pushing this narrative in the media. 

SLV inverting GME: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4mog/stop_buying_slv_you_smooth_brained_retards_its/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

The amount of paper contracts or IShares SLV available is basically infinite. Physical silver is a rare physical commodity with a finite supply, and a very low supply of retail sized bars/rounds/coins.

**IF** you want to go into silver for whatever reason, buy physical. But that’s just my retard opinion. 

**SILVER ISN’T “REDDITS NEXT BIG PLAY“.** You guys need to realize the GME situation is very unique and WSB is not, and never was about starting crazy short squeezes. GME is a rare opportunity where the big guys actually fucked up BIG TIME.

Well. Let’s see to what extend they fucked up exactly: 

**Short Version:**
The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails–to–deliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options – both ITM and OTM).  

Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

Long version here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9rk78/sec_doj_60_minutes_public_data_suggests_massive/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

**At these levels it’s NOT about the price, it’s about the number of shares in the hedgefunds possession. That’s why they want you to sell so bad.**

🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎

Last but not least I’m holding because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I’m holding because I hope to see a better future and I’m holding for all you out there. 
To the Moon or zero.

**On the technical side, $TLRY has been improving all its bottom q/q even. See image below.**

&#x200B;

[As you can see, revenue has increased, cost of revenue decreased, gross profit increased and finally net income increased significantly since last quarter.](https://preview.redd.it/ilezgowoiye61.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6215264f99816335fb9fe67c5d0edb78c275e4d)

With growth in revenue and net income, EPS have also increased q/q which is a great sign for investors. With US legalization on the horizon and expansion into EU markets, it hard to believe that $TLRY isn't headed up from here. Which should lead to a squeeze on the 50% short when they are forced to cover.

**TLDR; $TLRY has improving technical, balance sheets and is expanding into newer markets. With legalization in US on the horizon, its hard to believe that the 50% shorts wont be squeezed.**

In the first half of December, fuboTV’s stock more than doubled over two weeks on the back of super-strong subscriber numbers. The strength in fuboTV’s subscriber base broadly foreshadows its huge role in the live TV streaming world.

On the heels of that huge rally, multiple short-sellers targeted FUBO. The favored argument amongst bears is that demand for live TV is dying, the streaming platform itself is commoditized and the business model is built on broken economics. Fubo’s short interest currently sits at about 65% of the float.

Then, the Reddit-inspired short-squeeze broke out. It wasn’t just GME stock that went flying. All heavily shorted stocks flew alongside GME stock. FUBO stock, with 65% of its float sold short, was a beneficiary of the rising tide in heavily shorted names.

But, this week, many of these short squeeze stocks have plunged.

Not FUBO stock — and that’s because fuboTV is no GameStop or AMC.

## Unlike GameStop, fuboTV Is Fundamentally Strong

FuboTV — unlike many of the other heavily shorted companies that soared last week — is supported by very strong fundamentals and has a long runway for profitable growth ahead.

Here’s the story.

Media consumption is pivoting from linear TV to streaming TV because the latter is cheaper, more flexible, and more convenient. Yet, even though **Netflix** has reached ubiquity among U.S. households, most households still pay for cable TV, because Netflix doesn’t have live sports, live programming or news — three things which Americans still love to watch.

That’s why a new generation of live TV streaming services has emerged over the past decade. These services take live TV content, and package it into a streaming service — somewhat like a “Netflix for TV”. Because demand for live TV is robust and because streaming TV offers significant advantages over linear TV, these live TV streaming services represent the future of TV and will one day be as commonplace in households as cable TV is today.

fuboTV is one of these live TV streaming services. It’s differentiation is that it is a sports-focused live TV streaming platform. That is, the company is hyper-focused on acquiring exclusive sports content and launching a digital sportsbook to enable dynamic sports betting through its live TV streaming platform.

In other words, fuboTV projects as a live TV streaming service purpose-built for sports super-fans and gamblers.

That’s a large audience. About 70% of Americans classify themselves as sports fans. Around 60% have gambled in the past year. That number is only growing with online sports betting becoming legal in more and more states.

Thus, fuboTV projects as a streaming platform that will one day have tens of millions of paid subscribers. It has just 500,000 paid subs today.

The runway for growth here is very long — and consequently, the potential upside in FUBO stock is very big.

## FuboTV Stock to $200?

My numbers indicate that FUBO stock will soar to $200 over the next several years.

Here are those numbers.

I broadly assume that fuboTV can scale to \~10 million paid subscribers by 2030. I think that average revenue per subscriber per month can grow to about $70, assisted by ad revenue growth and sports betting revenue growth. That implies around $8.4 billion in 2030 revenues for fuboTV.

I see EBITDA margins running towards 20%, as ad revenue and sports betting revenue add higher-margin revenue firepower into the business model and boost margins.

Assuming so, my modeling suggests fuboTV is on track to do about $10 in earnings per share by 2030.

Based on a 20X multiple, that implies a long-term price target for FUBO stock of $200.

## Bottom Line on FUBO Stock

Not all short squeeze stocks are created equal. On one hand, you have GME stock and AMC stock, who have tons of short squeeze firepower but very weak fundamentals. On the other hand, you have FUBO stock, who has almost as much short-squeeze firepower and strong fundamentals, too.

That’s a powerful combination which should sustain the current uptrend in FUBO stock not just for the next few days — but for the next few years, as well."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082633.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['TV', 'TV', 'FUBO', 'TV', 'GME', 'GME', 'FUBO', 'FUBO', 'TV', 'AMC', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'U', 'S', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'FUBO', 'TV', 'FUBO', 'I', 'TV', 'I', 'TV', 'I', 'BITDA', 'TV', 'X', 'FUBO', 'FUBO', 'GME', 'AMC', 'FUBO', 'FUBO']|['GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'AMC']

After reading this post by u/johnnydaggers
https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/ , I got curious if this theory had legs.

I downloaded all the data for the last 10 years, and charted the daily FTD's vs Price action.  It yields some interesting results:

EDIT: Blue lines are # total collective failures on that date, green line is closing price 

GME: https://i.imgur.com/dvqlgib.png 

AMC: https://i.imgur.com/OLymQ4j.png

For both these stocks the failure to delivers are off the charts in recent history, and those increases in failures seem to correlate with suppressed pricing.  Now there may be legit reasons for a failure to happen, and without knowing which firms caused these failures we can't truly draw any conclusions other than *something is fucky*.


We can pretty easily generate a corresponding chart for any symbol with this:

GM: https://i.imgur.com/7d96w7B.png

Now IF these failures are coming from a handful of firms (SEC / DTCC should have that data..), I would say it is quite evident of intentional naked selling to manipulate the markets.  But ~~I'm not an expert~~ _I am a smoothbrained retard ape_ and would love to hear from anyone who understands this better than I do.

This is about how this squeeze is going to affect history.

All of this short squeeze business is nothing more than a numbers game. We’ve been hearing price targets from $1k to $100k, with $100k being considered outlandishly high.

Yes, it’s a lot of money, but this situation boils down to nothing more than a math problem. Math does not care if its a lot of money.

So lets look at some numbers. The most similar event we have ever seen in history is the VW squeeze. This was caused by hedge funds owing a short interest of **12%** and Porsche buying up **43%** of the float. VW became the most valuable company in the world, which in GME’s case would put it at $30,000 per share.

As we all know, GME was shorted 140%. And Im willing to bet that us 💎🤲🦍 are currently holding well over 43% of the float, with no intention of letting go.

I dont need a phd to tell you what that means for GME.

So lets say GME hits $100k, which if you look at the numbers, is a massively conservative estimate.

The hedge funds are dying at $300. At $100k they are going to have to liquidate every asset in their possession to cover their shorts. All their stocks other than GME will be sold. This means the rest of the market is going to plummet. I estimate that march 2020 will look like a joke. The hedge funds will have no way to cover, and someone is going to have to bail them out. **Our economy is about to collapse.**

The hedge funds know this. Why do you think they are so long on Silver and Gold? Precious metals perform well during recessions. 

Andddd because this is WSB, here are my positions:
- GME shares
- SPY 374p 2/5
- SPY 300p 3/1
- SPY 250p 3/1
- UVXY 14c 3/1
- not a single SLV call or share because fuck the hedge funds

TLDR: 🦍🦍🦍💎🤲🌈🐻

Edit:
To those of you saying I’m making up numbers:

[VW was shorted 12% and Porsche bought 43%](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/heres-how-the-gamestop-short-squeeze-is-like-the-vw-squeeze-of-2008/ar-BB1d9yVI) 

GME as most valuable company in the world: $2.25T/69.5M = $32,375

I used $100k as a lower bounds for the price because we can assume a 10x higher short percent would create more than a 10x higher price, so multiplying by 3 is a safe lower bound."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['I', 'GME', 'VW', 'VW', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'WSB', 'GME', 'SPY', 'SPY', 'SPY', 'UVXY', 'SLV', 'VW', 'GME', 'M', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

A great many of you who are participating in this sub are new to the community and many of you are new to trading/ finance altogether. I have been a long time lurker and have never worked up the courage to post anything of my own. After missing out on the SPY PUT option bonanza that occurred back in March/ April, I vowed I would be put myself in a position to capitalize on the next big thing. Fast forward to GME and while I was a little late to the party, I did get in with everything I could, and regardless of the outcome I have enjoyed myself and have learned more in the last two weeks than during any previous stretch.

Many of the comments on the daily threads center around the price of GME falling and wondering if now is the time to get out. It is common knowledge that we have been the victim of Short Ladder attacks, internal disinformation campaigns, external disinformation campaigns, market manipulation, and straight up suppression. Of specific interest to the neophytes in this community is why the low trading volume last week and especially today matter when the price starts to drop consistently and dramatically, especially during After-Hours trading. 

I pulled some Level II data from Robinhood detailing the AH trading volume and the corresponding price decrease. Between the hours of 4 PM EST and 5:55 PM EST, Robinhood shows a total of 475,690 shares traded. When compared to average volume and the corresponding price drop we arrive at the following:

**Shares Traded: 475,690**

**Average Volume: 106,230,000**

**Volume Percentage: 0.448%**

The closing price at 4 PM was $222.87 and the closing price at 5:55 PM was $176.77 meaning a share price decline of $46.10

During AH trading, GME share price fell **20.7%** on trading volume **0.448%** of the current average. THIS IS A MASSIVE ASYMMETRY and in my mind, it supports the idea that the establishment is suppressing this stock to continue scaring us all out of the market.

I rewatched ""The Big Short"" this afternoon and it was funny to me that in that situation, no one and I mean NO ONE thought any of those guys were right. And when it turned out they were in fact correct, the banks LIED and CONCEALED the true value of the shorts UNTIL they were able to put themselves in a position to try and make money off of the problem they themselves created. Friends, it feels like we are in the same kind of endgame now and I ask that everyone remain diamond-handed and patient. The math is on our side and if it doesn't work out it's because they found a way to cheat and screw us before we knew what they were doing."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['A', 'I', 'SPY', 'PUT', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'II', 'AH', 'PM', 'EST', 'PM', 'EST', 'PM', 'PM', 'AH', 'GME', 'THIS', 'IS', 'A', 'SSIVE', 'METRY', 'I', 'I', 'NO', 'ONE', 'LIED', 'EALED', 'UNTIL', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Notice anything weird about their charts? The HFs are purchasing ETFs that have exposure to GME and are ""redeeming"" the shares inside of them to get access to the rights to a GME stock. They're using the redemption rights from the ETFs to then sell the stock without directly influencing the price of GME. 

Here's some proof from the top four ETFs with exposure to GME:

**""But the price is dropping!!! HOW WILL I BE ABLE TO EARN MONEY WHEN IT GOES NEGATIVE??????""**

Stocks are priced after **supply** and **demand.** 

If **supply** is **high** then price is **low**
If **demand** is **high** then price is **high**

But what if the **demand** was **high**, the supply was **low** and you, as someone whos **shorted** this stock, needed the **supply** to be **high** so price becomes **low**

Well...
What you could do is trick the system, it is illegal but you stand to lose a couple million in a lawsuit vs billions in your bad shorting of stocks.

So you hatch a plan. You and your hedgefund friends are going to use your own stocks that you own and trade them very very quickly with eachother at low low prices. The supply is still low, you guys are only trading a couple hundred or thousand stocks, but the system cant recognize that its the **same** stocks being traded. Its just seeing the **amount of times** the same stock is being traded. So one stock being moved 5 times the system sees as 5 different stocks, and therefore thinks the supply is **high**.

Thing is, this only drives the price down. It doesnt matter though, since you as someone who is **holding** isnt selling at that price. It doesnt MATTER what the price is if noone is selling. See, the price decrease because the same stocks are being traded constantly tricking the system into thinking its many different stocks being traded once, however since the price is too low for the people who are holding the other stocks they are not selling. The supply is still **low**.

Why is this important? Its important because the hedgefunds need to **BUY** your stocks to close their positions. They literally cannot close their shorts unless they buy **YOUR** stocks. This is why you are supposed to hold your stocks, no matter how low the price is. The price is a facade, they want you to sell at a price they are setting. If you are not selling even though the price is low, they cant buy. And if they cant buy they cant close their shorts. If they cant close their shorts they'll have to pay interest. And when the interest becomes too much they are going to be **FORCED** to buy **YOUR** stocks at whatever price **YOU** offer. This is the **squeeze**

The squeeze starts when the hedgefunds cant afford to trick the system anymore since the interest on their shorts are getting too much. Theyll have to pay whatever we ask of them. If noone sells untill 1000usd they are going to be forced to pay that, if noone sells until 10000usd theyll have to pay that amount instead. When they are forced to close their positions en masse they will **FLOOD** the marketplace with orders to buy. This is going to skyrocket the stocks, and the price will keep rising until people start selling. However if you sell during the short ladder attacks, the squeeze wont happen. The price set during the attacks isnt the actual price. Its a price thats tricked into the system. 

This is why you **HOLD** no matter how much the price goes down. if **everyone** holds there is no **supply** and if there is no **supply** it doesnt matter how low the price is **SINCE THERE IS LITERALLY NOONE FOR THE HEDGEFUNDS TO BUY FROM** so they cant close their positions, theyll have to keep paying interest, and at some point they will **HAVE** to **BUY YOUR STOCKS** no matter the **PRICE**.

https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml

Buy orders **(demand)** are more than sell orders **(supply)** and yet the stock lost value. 

This is why people are talking about **volume**. The **total amount** of stocks **(actual supply)** being traded is **low (price should increase)**, but **the total amount of times (percieved supply)** those same stocks are being traded is **high (price decreases)**.

You need to understand, it doesnt matter how low the price drops right now, the squeeze hasnt happened. the squeeze happens when the hedgefunds are **forced** to buy back. That is the squeeze, and it is what will skyrocket the stocks. Right now the hedgefunds are trying to prevent the squeeze.

So what are you going to do, give up? or capitalize on their fuck up? Every dollar the hedgefunds lose goes to us, but only so long as we own stocks. 

So **HOLD**, the price might drop but the rocket launches when the HF's are forced to buy back.

Obligatory disclaimer: Mods, for the love of god please let this through it took a lot to write and I know for a fact it hasn't been discussed sufficiently / didn't get a dedicated post yet. Also, I'm a 🦍 and am not financial advisor and this isn't financial advice. This is a synthesis of public available information with autistic analysis like sprinkles on a birthday cupcake.

Disclaimer 2: I am extremely long $GME 🚀🌙 

With that out of the way, I present to you,

# Exhibit A: Order Distribution

\~***75%*** of all $GME orders on Fidelity *today, on 2/1* were to *buy* the asset, rather than sell it. Each order can have however many shares.

[https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)

That's just Fidelity. If you're able to check the order distribution on other brokers (like Vanguard or Schwab) please post it below and I'll update this post with your info. Usually this information is displayed on Top Traded Stocks or on the stock page itself under some tab. 

There's more:

WeBull is showing a 45/55 distribution on the entire order book. Total Outflow (sells) was quoted at 1099, and total inflow at 996. While this may seem useless at first, consider this: the share price lost ***30***% today, but the order book is split ***45/55***, not ***35/65***. Just 10% of the outflow accounted for the 30% collapse in share price.

# Exhibit B: Volume

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/)

Today's volume was half of the daily average. *Half of the daily average*. And while the price 30% movement may seem scary at first, trending down on low volume is actually a bullish sign. Courtesy of u/weedcomet:

""[https://finance.zacks.com/importance-price-changes-previous-day-stock-market-2906.html](https://finance.zacks.com/importance-price-changes-previous-day-stock-market-2906.html) 'After a strong-volume upward move, if the market moves sideways in conjunction with lower volume for several days in a row, it is a bullish sign indicating that all overhanging selling pressure has been relieved and any buying could spark a strong price rise.'""

In other words, flat or even *declining* on low volume often precedes 🚀 🚀 🌝. Literally any form of significant buying can move the price by a very high magnitude.

There's also been studies done on this phenomena, and correlation was established between sideways or negative movement on low volume and a subsequent increase in price. Feel free to research this on your own accord and post your findings below for all of us autists to read.

# Exhibit C: Why Retail Buying May Return Soon

I'm not a financial advisor, and even less so Nostradamus. I don't know when we'll be able to take advantage of this sideways movement to our benefit. What I do know is that that time is approaching. Considering two major events:

1. Transition from Robinhood &amp; other affected brokers to mainstream solutions  
• This was likely started en masse on Thursday, before RH transfer restrictions kicked in. It takes 2-5 market days to transfer an account to another broker, and about the same for just slushing cash around. That means, a solid chunk of trades will be able to buy into the market beginning tomorrow and throughout the remaining week.  
• Many are also in the process of opening up new accounts. These were probably started en masse on Friday, when transfer restrictions prevented people from taking the plunge. A solid chunk of brokers need settlement time for instant deposits.  
\- The instant deposits are capped, meaning whale accounts aren't able to kick in yet. Regular deposits takes 1-2 business days to clear. Beginning tomorrow, we'll start seeing larger retail accounts com online and regain their impact on price delta.
2. Robinhood bottleneck may or may not disappear this week. Robinhood just raised another $2.4 billion on top of their previous round, which is more than enough to clear DTC's collateral requirements. According to their own statements as of late, this was the primary reason why Robinhood restricted asset purchases in the first place. If you're willing to trust them on that, it means that we shall see a resurgence in volume from remaining Robinhood users in the coming days.

# Conclusions

Putting 1+2+3 together we get a potential recipe for another green EoW. Retail sentiment being positive can translate into higher volume once logistical bottlenecks are cleared and resume ass-ripping activities. HOWEVER, it is by NO MEANS guaranteed, and only the tippy top of the world know exactly what these mfs might pull off in the coming days. Get yourselves ready for either a positive or negative scenario this week / beginning of next.

GME to moon.

**ANOTHER EDIT:**
Welcome to the end of the post. I’m proud of you for making it this far in literacy class. I want to respond to all of your comments and questions but automod deletes all but a couple of them. I’ll answer them as soon as they show up.

**UPDATE:**
Ok automod deleted a bunch of negative feedback which is WRONG. Also some FAQs that got blocked. The questions were valid so here’s the best I could do:

1–Retail made no dent so what to expect now?
- I don’t know what to expect. What I do know is that retail made no dent because of the bottlenecks mentioned in Exhibit C above.

2–Should I buy now or what?
- I want you to make your own conclusion based on available evidence, not seek confirmation bias. I don’t want to be liable for your money and neither does anyone else.

3–Smart money is leaving and you’ll be left holding the bag
- I have yet to see credible evidence in either the trading volume, SEC reports, or formal announcements from any major institutional shareholder of GameStop that indicates they’re leaving. If you have this information please relay it to me (don’t use comments, you’ll get blocked by bot). BlackRock had to adjust due to internal requirements AFAIK correct me if I’m wrong

4–AMC?
- I have no data on AMC. You should do your own research and make a thread like this.

5–When selling then?
- I have an emergency exit plan like everyone else should. I don’t have the financial capability to let GME go to 0. I’ll keep a small position post-exit just in case. Make an exit plan that aligns with what loss or gain you can stomach. Don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose. Nothing on this sub is financial advice. You don’t have to sell if you can lose everything. I’m probably liquidating my options and doing shares only until further trend confirmation."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|['$GME', 'DONT', 'BUY', 'INTO', 'THE', 'FUD']|['GME']|['RTANT', 'I', 'I', '$GME', '$AMC', '$GME', 'I', 'I', '$GME', 'I', '$GME', 'I', 'I', 'RH', 'A', 'W', 'WEVER', 'NO', 'MEANS', 'GME', 'OTHER', 'I', 'WRONG', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'C', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'SEC', 'AFAIK', 'AMC', 'I', 'AMC', 'I', 'I', 'GME']|['GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'RH', 'GME', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'GME']

As we know, the short squeeze (SS) is not a matter of IF. It's a matter of WHEN. The HFs know this, WSB users that know half a thing about the stock market know this. Now, the goal of the HF isn't to cancel the SS, it's to make it as less expensive as possible for them. In other words,  [here is what their bloomberg terminal screen is showing](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/026/981/0bd0ed742059cd7f4c83882095aeb3752e45dfbfv2_hq.jpg)

Now comes my theory: paper hands, aka people acting on emotion because of FUD and panic rather than what the numbers say (volume, technical analysic, etc.) are benefitting both us and HF. By selling at a loss or a meager price (anything less than 1k$ is free money, remember), they're allowing HF to cover their shorts for cheaper. 

Let's say the HF have a price target on GME of 1000$. In other words, their Harvard quants calculated that at a certain point, they could cover all their shorts and make the SS happen until GME hits 1000 (what I call the D-Day). After that point, they will no longer need to buy anymore shares, ending their torture. They would have covered most of their shorts without going bankrupt. That means that their goal will be to tire us, spread FUD, throw ladder attacks until they can quickly cover their shorts from whatever the price will be to 1000$ (supposing 1000$ is the price they calculated is the more beneficial)

The HF goal is to not go bankrupt. Therefore, paper hands selling their shares could make the SS happen faster by giving more shares to HF (while giving us more shares for cheap, naturally) until the D-Day. 

It's a **win-win scenario for diamond hands**. Whether paper hands sell or not, **the SS WILL happen**. 

disclaimer: I know nothing about the stock market, I'm just theorizing. What do everyone thinks of this?

TLDR: Paper hands selling might make the SS happen faster for holders (as long as there isn't too many of them)."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082633.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['GME', 'IF', 'WHEN', 'WSB', 'HF', 'SS', 'FUD', 'HF', 'HF', 'HF', 'GME', 'SS', 'GME', 'I', 'FUD', 'HF', 'SS', 'HF', 'SS', 'WILL', 'I', 'SS']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME']

> Short selling involves a sale of a security that the seller does not own or a sale which is consummated by the delivery of a security borrowed by, or for the account of, the seller. Short sales normally are settled by the delivery of a security borrowed by or on behalf of the seller.

> In a ‘‘naked’’ short sale, however, the short seller does not borrow securities in time to make delivery to the buyer within the standard three-day settlement period. As a result, the seller fails to deliver securities to the buyer when delivery is due.

> **Sellers sometimes intentionally fail to deliver securities as part of a scheme to manipulate the price of a security, or possibly to avoid borrowing costs associated with short sales, especially when the costs of borrowing stock are high.**

**This is what happened today with the price decrease**

*edit: Apparently the Fail-To-Deliver is not cumulative, but as of 1-14 it's 621,483 and that number can only be higher now. Regardless, the sentiment stands.*

shares of the stock meaning these short sellers are using Naked Short Selling and intentionally failing to deliver securities in order to avoid borrowing costs and manipulate the price of the stock downward.

# What's to be done?

Rule 204.

> Rule 204 — Close-out Requirements. Under Rule 204, participants of a registered clearing agency (as defined in section 3(a)(24) of the Exchange Act) must deliver securities to a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement on a long or short sale transaction in any equity security by settlement date, or must close out a fail to deliver in any equity security for a long or short sale transaction in that equity security generally by the times described as follows: the participant must close out a fail to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+4; if a participant has a fail to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona-fide market making activities, the participant must close out the fail to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in “threshold securities” if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days. Threshold securities, as defined by Rule 203(c)(6), are generally equity securities with large and persistent fails to deliver.

You can read more about this here: https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.204 lots of information that I haven't covered.

Gamestop *is* or will be classified as a threshold security due to the massive amounts of Fail-To-Deliver's they've accumulated this month, this means short sellers are legally forced to close their short positions and clearing houses will be be required to immediately purchase shares within the time-frame stated above. AKA SQUEEZE WILL BE SQUOZEN.

Edit: According to [this](https://www.theocc.com/Market-Data/Market-Data-Reports/Series-and-Trading-Data/Threshold-Securities-List) website, Gamestop IS listed as a threshold security.

#SHORT SELLERS ARE UNDER THE THUMB, AND ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY'RE SQUEEZED.

Their last hail mary is to manipulate the price downward as much as possible to lessen the blow of the inevitable squeeze. We literally have them by the balls and all we have to do is HOLD.

#TL:DR

The short squeeze is a ticking time bomb right now and all we have to do is hold to win. In a matter of days, short sellers will be FORCED to close their positions and clearing houses will be forced to purchase shares for all Fail-to-Delivers forcing the price to skyrocket and the squeeze to be squozen.

HOLD TIGHT YOU RETARDS, WE'RE GOING TO THE MOON. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/low\_volume\_pullback.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/low_volume_pullback.asp)

""Low volume pullbacks are often a sign of weak longs taking profit, **but suggest that the long-term uptrend remains intact.""**

This Zacks link goes into good detail on interpreting low volume and stock price manipulation:

[https://finance.zacks.com/mean-stock-price-goes-up-down-little-volume-2497.html](https://finance.zacks.com/mean-stock-price-goes-up-down-little-volume-2497.html)

"" Interpreting Price and Volume Action

Price action reflects investor sentiment. If a stock is rising, investors are eager to buy; if it is falling, investors are eager to sell. **But for a move to be valid, the stock price action must be confirmed by volume**. As technicians say, volume goes with the trend. **Volume shows how much conviction investors have in a trend.**

When you multiply the number of shares traded by the current stock price, you get the total dollar amount that investors are willing to put at risk. **Low volume means few investors are putting only a little money at risk. You cannot trust such price moves, as they are fickle and can easily reverse.""**

 

## Understanding Manipulation

**It is easier to manipulate a stock when its volume is low**. **All a manipulator needs to do is execute a few carefully timed trades to create the illusion that a stock is moving so he can get others to buy or sell**. **The goal is** to raise the price if he wants to sell and t**o lower the price if he wants to buy**. If you are suckered in by such a move, your position can quickly turn into a loss as the stock you just bought suddenly reverses course on increased volume.

They specialize in mining Iron Ore, Nickel, Manganese, Coal, and Copper. It has huge upside with the potential to 10x at a moment's notice.

20% of Analysts rank it as a Strong Buy

80% of Analysts rank it as a Buy

However, the price targets are not the high, why? They have been fined 2 billion dollars by the Brazilian government over a collapsed dam, but that doesn't really matter in the short term does it.

$VALE produces Nickel and Copper which are fundamental to battery production, and it just so happens there is a worldwide shortage on Nickel which is fundamental to battery production. The EV market continues to expand, and with continued growth more and more nickel is needed to meet demand.

So why the huge upside potential?

One Answer: Papa Elon

Elon Musk has said a number of times that Tesla will give sustainable mining companies a large agreement. I believe that the time for a large Tesla contract is soon, and VALE in my opinion is most likely to receive the contract. If this were to happen I would not doubt a price jump of 10x immediately to fall and stay steady at 5x at around $80-$100 a share similar evaluation to $CAT in the short term, and if battery production continues at exponential growth I could this becoming a trillion dollar company by 2030.

Let me know your thoughts. Do you think I am right or just a retard redditor?

Edit: I have also seen a large order volume for 2/19 21C if that is any indicator of anything, perhaps insider knowledge. I am unsure, but these are just my observations.

It has been growing steadily thus far and I know it will grow a lot more into 2021 with Biden putting up a lot of money into green energy. 

Here's a list of things Biden is doing for green energy, which will ultimately push ICLN upwards :

1. Joining the Paris Climate Agreement
2. Cancelling the Keystone Oil Pipeline
3.  Biden will invest $400 billion over ten years, as one part of a broad mobilization of public investment, in clean energy and innovation. That investment is twice the investment of the Apollo program which put a man on the moon, in today’s dollars. He will also establish ARPA-C, a new research agency focused on accelerating climate technologies.  
4. Biden will set a target of reducing the carbon footprint of the U.S. building stock 50% by 2035, creating incentives for deep retrofits that combine appliance electrification, efficiency, and on-site clean power generation. He will work with our nation’s governors and mayors to support the deployment of more than 500,000 new public charging outlets by the end of 2030. And, Biden will ensure our agricultural sector is the first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions, and that our farmers earn income as we meet this milestone. 
5.  Biden will require public companies to disclose climate-related financial risks and the greenhouse gas emissions in their operations and supply chains. In his first year, he’ll work to enact legislation requiring polluters to bear the full cost of their climate pollution. But that’s not all: Biden will direct his EPA and Justice Department to pursue these cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and, when needed, seek additional legislation to hold corporate executives personally accountable – including jail time when merited. Allowing corporations to continue to pollute – affecting the health and safety of both their workers and surrounding communities – without consequences perpetuates an egregious abuse of power. These companies must be accountable to the American people, the communities where they operate, and the workers they employ. 
6.  Every federal dollar spent on rebuilding our infrastructure during the Biden Administration will be used to prevent, reduce, and withstand the impacts of this climate crisis. American workers should build American infrastructure and manufacture all the materials that go into it, and all of these workers must have the option to join a union and collectively bargain. Biden will ensure his [infrastructure legislation](https://joebiden.com/infrastructure) incorporates labor provisions so federal investments create millions of middle-class jobs, benefiting workers across industries.  

All of this is straight from his website. Since ICLN is an etf and does not swing ( A good thing IMO ) it is an extremely good candidate for buying shares.

But since we like to live on the edge, the best thing for us to do would be to buy ATM or ITM options that expire a long time from now.

To me it’s unclear how the recent SolarWinds hack will impact Q4 earnings due to the timing of the hack. On a recent conf call Mandia mentioned that Incident Response hours aren’t billed until after the incident response engagement is over. The SolarWinds news broke on Sunday Dec 13th.  Response engagements of this scale typically take weeks if not months. So we might be looking at meeting Q4 estimates but raising Q1 guidance.  Even without a beat, I’ll take this as a bullish sign. 

I’ve been watching job openings at FireEye for the last month.  They’ve been recruiting non-stop and a large portion of these at Incident Response or other services consultants. There are currently 192 open roles.  

Back of the napkin calculations are... many of the senior roles will be sent immediately into the field at a billing rate between $250-$450. At a 80% utilization that is between $400k-$720k per head per year. If they have hired between 50-100 people into these roles since the Solarwinds hack that is could lead to $20M-$36M revenue increase on the low end to $40M-$72M on the high end. With current annual revenues at $928M we could see an annual revenue increase of 7% on these services alone which is above their current 6.9% revenue growth rate. If we see acceleration in any of their newish businesses like Managed Defense and Mandiant Advantage Cyber Threat Intelligence services we could have a great growth story on our hands. Incident Response services are (hopefully) a one time thing for breached companies but Managed Defense and Intel services are a recurring revenue stream, so growth in these areas would be a very good thing indeed. 

Any upticks in the hardware business would be positive news, but I believe they are facing upgrade cycle challenges and I’m not expecting much on this front. 

Finally, I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw FEYE acquired by a larger player in the next few months. There have been multiple rounds of rumors over the last few years that indicate FEYE has hired an investment bank to assist with the process. While Mandia hasn’t confirmed these rumors, he hasn’t denied them either. Cisco allegedly passed. I think good candidates are Microsoft, IBM or even someone like CrowdStrike using their astronomically high share price to swing a deal and create a cyber powerhouse to rival Pali Alto.  

I’m long with shares, considering NTM/OTM LEAPS, might by some June calls.  FD weeklies might payout but are risky IMO."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082633.csv|DueDiligence|['FEYE']|['FEYE']|['FEYE', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'I', 'I', 'FEYE', 'FEYE', 'I', 'IBM', 'OTM', 'LEAPS', 'FD', 'IMO']|['FEYE', 'FEYE', 'FEYE', 'IBM']

Not looking for awards - I'm looking for this knowledge/idea to get out there. 

So a lot of the newbies and paper hands are getting spooked by the decreasing price, but it's not a bad thing because the volume of stocks traded are the same. At the end of the day, those stocks are owed to investors by the short-sellers irrespective of the price. The fact that there are virtually no stocks to be traded apart from the ones being traded to each other (i.e. inducing ladder attacks) is where the problem lies for them.

That is the key point; hedges still need to buy the stocks to close their over-shorted positions. A low price is instrumental in allowing people to buy stocks back and will enable those who missed the first spike to get back into the game. With everyone being able to buy stocks at a lower price, we may have the firepower needed to re-commence the buying of stocks and finally induce the MOASS due to their heavily shorted positions.

**THIS IS WHY THE NEWS IS SO ADAMANT ON SAYING THE REDDIT ARMY HAS MOVED ON; THEY DO NOT WANT INVESTORS TO BUY IN AT A LOWER PRICE AGAIN BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY ROYALLY SCREWED**. All their efforts will have been in vein and there will be even MORE longed stocks that are owed, thanks to investors who bough at that dip. This is why it is important to hold.

Whatever you do I'm going to keep going.  We literally are capable of changing the country for the better. I might be an idealistic retard but the alternative is to sulk back into the basement and let's the Hedgers destroy the country.

Capital buys politicians, regulators (Yellen) and lawyers to delay and diminish any possible consequences.

Capital means dodging $100 billion in losses today in exchange for a $100 million fine a year from now.

Not saying sell GME to buy FUBO, just saying there are other interesting alternatives out there, and FUBO is one of them. Also, it's heavily shorted.*

&#x200B;

\- **Share Facts -**

* **FuboTV, ticker FUBO**
* **IV:** Around 200% this morning on puts expiring Feb-12th
* **FUBO earnings date:** Estimated to be Feb 5th
* **Share Float:** 52.06M (as per [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FUBO/key-statistics?p=FUBO))
* **Short % of Float:** 72.74% (as of Jan 15th, as per [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FUBO/key-statistics?p=FUBO))
   * I mention this because FUBO was heavily shorted when the stock rose in the $60’s, and unfortunately shorters succeeded in crashing the price.
* **Market Cap:** $2.85 B

**My position**

* 38 shares @ approx. $31
* 100 shares @ approx $43 bought this morning, and sold a covered call at $55 strike for $6.10 for Feb-12th. I'm sure I'll regret it, but the yield on both the call itself, and the potential yield if I get called away for downright phenomenal, hard to turn down.

&#x200B;

**- The DD -**

**What is FuboTV?**

Mama Wood said it herself (paraphrasing here): Cable is dying, to hell with cable, we want MOAR STREAMING!!!!!!!!!

Seriously, cable and television plans are dying. Nowadays you have a ton of flexible solutions, from the obvious Netflix and YouTube, to Amazon Prime, Sling TV, Hulu, etc. FUBO is capitalizing on this trend for sports fans. It is the country's first sports-first service. While the price might seem steep, it gives you access to dozens of regional, national and international sports channels, including live events in 4K HDR.

Beyond sports, it offers much more; 112 channels in total, including 43 of the top 50 Nielson-rated networks (for you autists and retards out there, Nielson is an American information, data and market measurement firm operating in over 100 countries and employing 44,000 people (says Wikipedia, I’m too retarded to do more research on them). Sample non-sports related channels on FUBO include: A&E, Adult Swim, AMC, BBC America, Bravo, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, etc. Yes, they even have the Weather Network.

**Recent acquisitions:**

No DD of a hyper fast growing company would be complete without discussing acquisitions.

* **Vigtory:** The company is in the process of acquiring and integrating Vigtory Inc to the platform. Vigtory is a sportsbook (sports betting). It will also remain available to those not using FuboTV (aka: additional revenues, but also additional marketing for FuboTV)
* **Balto:** Balto develops tools for users to organize and play fantasy sports games, and FuboTV intends to combine its technology with Balto to launch a free-to-play gaming offering.

**Some numbers (yes, the quant stuff):**

Average revenue per user (ARPU) has gone from $37.93 per month in 2019, to $53.73 in 2019, and to $67.70 in the latest quarter. In contrast, it’s average monthly cost per user has risen from $40.59 in 2018 to $56.78 in the last quarter. Yes, they were obviously operating at a loss, and yes they are now operating at a positive contribution profit. As of the latest quarter, they had 455,000 paid subcribers. Grand news, yes?

**Q3 results, and guidance for Q4:**

Spoiler alert: The numbers are fantastic.

* Q3: Revenues of $61.2 million, an increase of close to 50% on a YoY basis.
   * Breaking revenues down: Subscription revenues up by 64% at $53.4 million, and advertising revenues up by 153% at $7.5 million
   * Paid subscribers increased by 58% on a YoY basis, and ARPU increased by 14% on a YOY basis. [See here the meteoric rise](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201110005911/en/fuboTV-Announces-Q3-2020-Results). Sexy, ain’t it?
   * Hours spent watching FuboTV also skyrocketed, an increase of 83% YoY (133.3 million hours). Monthly Active Users watched on average 120h per month. This is a 20% increase YoY
* Q4 guidance: Spoiler alert: They raised their guidance mid quarter because they are so bloody awesome
   * Q4 revenue to be expected between $94 to $98 million, prior guidance was $80 to $85 million. The new guidance represents a 77% to 84% YoY revenue increase
   * Paid subscribers to be expected to exceed 545,000, prior guidance was 500k to 510k. The new guidance represents a 72% YoY increase.

**What now?**

Sure, they are not profitable yet. Big whoop, they are still young, FuboTV was founded in 2015. But you know what? It took ages for Netflix to become profitable (about 7 or 8 years, I believe). The way FUBO is growing their paid subscribers base, and the way the hours are increasing YoY, we can expect them to reach profitability sooner rather than later. When? I don’t have a crystal ball, if I do I’d be a billionaire. We can expect that as they continue to scale up and add more users, they will continue to increase their advertisement revenues (duh), and also that their cost of new client acquisition will become lower (also duh)

**What are the risks?**

* For FUBO to thrive and grow, they need live sports. COVID dented their growth due to professional sports suspending seasons. If we go into another massive lockdown (less and less likely as vaccines ever so slowly roll out), this could cause another dent in their growth.
* It’s still heavily shorted, as the price continues to go up (especially if they smash their guidance), expect some shady shit GME-style from hedge funds to bring the price down.

**TLDR:** Awesome growth potential, heavily shorted (not at the GME scale, but still heavily shorted so you need to be mindful of that and potential WSB attention to the stock, or potential shady business from shorters).

***Rule 201 – Short Sale Price Test Circuit Breaker***\*\*.\*\*     Requires trading centers to establish, maintain,    and  enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to  prevent the execution or display of a short sale at an impermissible price when a stock has triggered a circuit breaker by experiencing *a* **price decline of at least 10 percent in one day.** *Once the circuit  breaker in Rule 201 has been triggered, the price test restriction* ***will  app*****ly to short sale orders in that security for the remainder of the day**  **and the following day,** unless an exception applies.

*Rule 203(b)(1) and (2) – Locate Requirement*.  Regulation SHO requires a broker-dealer to have **reasonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed** so that it can be delivered on  the date delivery is due before effecting a short sale order in any  equity security.[\[7\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn7) **This “locate” must be made and documented prior to effecting the short sale.**

# Did brokers have a place where they ""reasonably"" believed they could get the shares from?

# Answer: FUCK NO

&#x200B;

[Figure 2: Screen shot from AlphaRRCapital as shown in u\/monarchy8822 post \[2\] ](https://preview.redd.it/8y5x154d1ze61.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6a712811e30e7d1f55637a5dc04445ca48e9d41)

**Rule 204 – Close-out Requirement.** Rule 204 requires brokers and dealers that are participants of a registered clearing agency[\[8\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn8)to  take action to close out failure to deliver positions. Closing out     requires the broker or dealer to purchase or borrow securities of  like    kind and quantity. The participant must close out a failure to   deliver   for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of   regular   trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement   date,   referred to as T+4. If a participant has a failure to deliver   that the   participant can demonstrate on its books and records  resulted  from a   long sale, or that is attributable to bona fide market making activities, the participant must close out the failure  to deliver by  no   later than the beginning of regular trading hours on  the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date,  referred to as    T+6. If the position is not closed out, the broker or  dealer and any    broker or dealer for which it clears transactions (for  example, an    introducing broker)[\[9\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn9)**may  not effect further short sales in that security without borrowing    or  entering into a bona fide agreement to borrow the security (known  as    the “pre-borrowing” requirement) until the broker or dealer  purchases    shares to close out the position and the purchase clears and  settles**.   In  addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that    participants  of a registered clearing agency must immediately   purchase  shares to  close out failures to deliver in securities with   large and  persistent  failures to deliver, **referred to as “threshold securities,”** if the  failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.[\[10\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn10) **Threshold securities are equity securities**[**\[11\]**](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn11)**that  have an aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive     settlement days** at a registered clearing agency (e.g., National     Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)); **totaling 10,000 shares or more; and equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer's total shares outstanding.**    As  provided in Rule 203 of Regulation SHO, threshold securities are     included on a list disseminated by a self-regulatory organization     (“SRO”). Although as a result of compliance with Rule 204, generally a     participant’s fail to deliver positions will not remain for 13     consecutive settlement days, if, for whatever reason, a participant of a     registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a     registered clearing agency in a threshold security for 13 consecutive     settlement days, the requirement to close-out such position under Rule     203(b)(3) remains in effect.

# So, is GME a ""threshold security"" as defined by the SEC here:

* Outstanding Shares of GME:     \~ 69,750,000
* 0.5% of Outstanding GME Shares = \~300,000
* ""aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days"" = 2,351,180
* Is 2.3 million > 0.5% of Outstanding GME Shares **AND** is 2.3 million > 10,000 shares?

# Yea, it fucking is!

# Well, then they stopped issuing shorts until the previous ones closed position and settled, right..... RIGHT?!

**But how could they violate Regulation SHO Rules 201-204 you might ask? Aren't they're measure's in place after what happened in 2008/2009 to prevent that from ever happening?**

# BECAUSE SIMPLE MINDED RETAIL INVESTOR!

( ...now go invest in silver)

I'm still reading through it myself, and make corrections and add to it as you see fit, but it seems that there have been violations of **SHO Rules 201,203, and 204. PLEASE CONTINUE TO DO THE DD and USE MINE and OTHERS posts to DO THE FUCKING SEC's JOB FOR THEM!!!!!**

&#x200B;

# IN CONCLUSION, HOLD THE FUCKING LINE!!!!!

&#x200B;

**TLDR;**

1. NO SHORTS should have been executed Thursday when GME dropped down to $132 because it fell more than 10%, or any of the other fucking days!!!!
2. No new shorts should have been issued because there's no reasonable belief that they could find actual stock to lend given 140% short float as reported from December, and I doubt they secured it PRIOR to issuing new stock
3. They should have already executed the failed to deliver shorts ASAP because of the high number of FTD's and the high number of shorted shares

Residents see housing values fall and panic, and think they need to sell to avoid being the last worthless house. You and Karen keep buying and selling the same set of houses at cheaper and cheaper prices. Some paper handed idiots sell their grandpa’s farm because FMV keeps tanking.

If the ladder attack is successful you and Karen buy all the houses on the cheap because you NEED them and you successfully tanked the housing market in GME.

If you and Karen are the smoothest brains in the world, people catch on, buy the houses you are discounting for cheaper and cheaper and you need to offer more and more and more to buy the property because everyone realized you NEEDED the houses and some retail autist bought the houses you were trying to tank on the cheap.

Eventually, after paying a shit ton of closing costs (Interest) on the houses you are making no progress in buying the actual property you need and you need to start paying the inflated housing values for the property.

If people panic and sell on the cheap, win for HF. If people laugh and say suck it Melvin, then the property price rises and you get paid.

Obligatory I am not a financial advisor, just a smooth brain neanderthal. 

I noticed a post earlier calling out the 3/19 $800 call options and the significant volume. I wanted to do some digging, below is my attempt to explain what *might* be going on. Constructive criticism and contrarian ideas are more than welcomed. 

Let's start with the numbers...there were a total of 29,935 contracts of the GME $800 calls traded across these 4 expirations. This is compared to only 9,106 of open interest (for all you autists out there that don't know, the open interest aka OI is how many contracts were open through yesterday). Tomorrow morning will be interesting to see if the OI increases or decreases...this will help us understand if some of that volume was opening new positions or closing existing ones but regardless, many of them *have to be opening* *new contracts* since the volume is 3x the OI. Proof below.

[GME 2\/5 $800 Calls](https://preview.redd.it/3ovlfm0r5ze61.png?width=1777&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac534b7e8fd03d8dc1b1ac3ff68e16e2773a5df6)

Why would there be so much volume today for the GME $800 calls across so many expirations? There's a lot of different reasons this could happen, let's conduct a process of elimination to hopefully follow Occam's Razor and see what is the most likely and/or most reasonable explanation. My first assumption is that hedge funds are responsible for the volume, too much $ for retail IMO. If I take the last price at market close of each contract and add it up, this is \~$57M...also note that these were all traded in small chunks throughout the day, no massive orders of 1,000 blocks or anything, largest is a hundred or so. They accumulated throughout the day so that $57M should be a conservative estimate. Perhaps these were traded in sweeps throughout the day to not get seen by option scanners?

I don't see a good reason why HF's would sell all these naked...could they collect premium on downward or flat movement of GME? Yes, but that seems like a poor method to do so since the delta stinks. It also exposes the seller to *massive* risk of having to sell shares should they end up ITM. It's like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller, just not worth the money...we know they don't have shares to sell, they need to buy shares to cover their shorts.

I also don't see why these would be covered calls where they own the underlying because DUH the whole point is they are trying to obtain shares of GME to cover.

If they weren't sold naked or covered, then they had to be bought, but why? Well...\~$57M isn't *that* much when you're down billions so far on your shorts. If GME's price can be driven down through short ladder attacks from HF's to shake out weak paper handed bitches, through artificially suppressed retail demand by Brokers and their fuckery,  and through the media's fear tactics, this means 2 *very important* things could be achieved: 1.) They can have GME's price be lower than it otherwise would to begin the squeeze en masse that they know is inevitable and 2.) they can recognize significant profit/hedging from their deep OTM calls options on the way up. 

The HF's were caught with their pants down and have been given the luxury of time and support from external actors (Fuck you, RH IBBK TD and every other shady broker and the media) to get their ducks in a row. They are trying to engineer the squeeze *on their terms* to reduce their losses. 

TLDR: There is a TON of GME $800 call volume across multiple strikes. Seems weird for them to be sold. Might be HF's plan to profit/hedge on way up once the real squeeze begins now that they have been able to grind GME down with short ladder attacks and artificially suppressed retail demand from asshole brokers.

TLDR: I think the options market is indicating that funds are committed to their GME shorts till March 2021. Ask yourself if you're willing to hold and outlast them. If the answer to that is yes, you can do something truly impactful here that ONLY GME can make happen. If the answer is no, then end the farce and accept that some people will go home winners, some people will go home losers, and the hedge funds will likely make most of their money back because that's what they do.

Aphria and Tilray Combine to Create Largest Global Cannabis Company With Pro Forma Revenue of C$874 Million 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201216005519/en/

>Under the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Aphria will receive 0.8381 shares of Tilray for each Aphria common share, while holders of Tilray shares will continue to hold their Tilray shares with no adjustment to their holdings. Upon the completion of the Arrangement, Aphria Shareholders will own approximately 62 percent of the outstanding Tilray Shares on a fully diluted basis, resulting in a reverse acquisition of Tilray, representing a premium of 23 percent based on the share price at market close on December 15, 2020 to Tilray shareholders. On a pro forma basis for the last twelve months reported by each company, the Combined Company would have had revenue of C$874 million (US$685 million).

The cannabis industry as a whole has extreme growth potential. I recently made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lab9sk/the_rolling_20s_leaps_on_cannabis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) illustrating my views on US Legalization & the opportunity with long term plays. We have entered the ~~roaring~~ rolling 20’s, where cannabis regulations will ease dramatically.

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Aphria & Tilray are slowly taking over Europe. 

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of Aphria, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face to create desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through CC Pharma, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**What is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is a leading German Pharmaceutical and Medical Cannabis Distributor that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

Last week, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group.

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Aphria/Tilray will be first in line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised to be the best.

Fails-to-Deliver-Data - [https://www.sec.gov/files/data/fails-deliver-data/cnsfails202101a.zip](https://www.sec.gov/files/data/fails-deliver-data/cnsfails202101a.zip)

January 4th - AMC - 111,844 shares @ $2.12

January 5th - AMC - 1,631,091 shares @ $2.01

January 7th - AMC - 4,241,943 shares @ $2.01

January 8th - AMC - 11,547,981 shares @ $2.05

January 9-12th - AMC not on list

January 12th - AMC - 5900 shares @ $2.20

January 13-14th - AMC - not on list

I can see where the HYPE was coming from because apparently there was a failure to deliver 4M+ then 11M+ shares, but after that it looks like the ""shorters"" went on to short a much smaller supply. I guess there is still a possibility that the shorting continued, but I am having serious doubts. For those of you holding AMC, you might want to check into my claims to see that you and I got royally fucked. It's clearly not too big of a deficit if you need to sell, but you might want to sell if you have any profit left! unless you hold on to your shares with very little evidence of a future squeeze/potential (probably none). Maybe you'd like to hold onto until AMC becomes what they used to be (if that's possible), which I think I might do considering I bought in at 13 a piece. Anyway, hopefully this sparks a little controversy causing people to check my claim. I hope I'm wrong. BTW none of this is financial advise, do what you retards want

I'm definitely hanging on to my 1 GME and praying that bitch shoots to the moon

I believe people should view GME how they view startups and tech companies, with a focus on their future potential and how their fundamentals will enable or hinder growth, instead of focusing on their current price to earnings and short term volatility. I'm long on Gamestop because of changes in leadership, their new business strategy, and because their fundamentals are ***ACTUALLY*** ***PERFECT*** for company beginning to restructure and transform.

* Considering the pandemic and overall state of electronic retailers, let's compare [Gamestop](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638020000134/gme-20201031.htm) and [Best Buy](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/764478/000076447820000062/bby-20201031x10q.htm) fundamentals using their October 2020 10-Qs. BBY is much bigger than GME, isn't currently losing money, and no analysts are concerned about them going bankrupt, so how do their fundamentals compare? They both have relatively strong balance sheets for retailers in 2020, and both companies have almost identical quick ratios and networking capital ratios (.5 and 1.0). Their current distribution of their current assets is similar, but one huge positive for GME is that their current assets are 37.5% cash and about 50% inventory, which is great for companies beginning to restructure. A large cash balance grants the means to launch new company strategies, inventory obviously/hopefully means future revenue for retailers, and a conservative net AR balance in 2020 is likely for the best (not overestimating how much outstanding revenue can be collected). The majority of the current liabilities for GME are AP and accrued expenses, which is standard for commercial retail companies. However, it's more important to note relatively low levels of actual ***current*** debt, ***long term*** debt, and why the effect of operating leases on total liabilities is bullshit and stupid. [ASC 842](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/advocacy/policy-positions/leases-what-investors-need-to-know) changed how leases are accounted for effective January 2019, so operating leases are now shown as current and long term liabilities. So while GMEs debt to equity ratio looks significantly worse than Best Buys, I'd argue that its actually better. Getting out of an operating lease for a small store like Gamestop is pretty easy to negotiate or buy out, not easy to get out of a lease for the massive stores Best Buy leases. Also being F500 and having a huge market cap skewers D/E considerably. GME has a ton of cash, limited debt, and operating leases that that can be exited with ***some relative*** ease if needed, so Gamestop can restructure with plenty of breathing room.
* Looking at the income statement and cash flows, GME earnings are not awful given the conditions of brick and mortar stores during a pandemic. While Gamestop has a net income loss, they have good gross profits, and their gross margin is better than Best Buy. Gross margin indicates their core sales and costs of goods sold (costs directly related to revenue) are solid are fundamentally good. They just have too many general and administrative (non-revenue producing) expenses. I wonder what they could do to reduce overhead expenses of supplying and maintaining retail stores? Also, net income loss  and loss in cash flows from operating activity in October 2020 was less than 2019. So while it's definitely not ideal to see they losses, they made significant progress towards having a positive net income ***IN A PANDEMIC/RECESSION***, and this was still before the PS5 or Xbox Series X was released in November. GME had a positive total cash flow, but it was driven primarily from the sale of property and equipment. Sale of property and equipment is typically not a good sign for companies (think of a McDonalds not selling enough burgers so it starts selling off fryers for positive cash flow) but I believe it will be [good for them](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/making-stores-matter-in-a-multichannel-world#).  This is one of the first steps in their transformation to an online retailer, which I believe will ultimately make them profitable again. If you don't believe me, you can read exactly what their plan is.
* Ryan Cohen and other Chewy executives [did not invest and join the Gamestonk board](https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-adds-chewy-ryan-cohen-wall-street-darling-to-board-2021-1) for the lulz. They liked GMEs plan and the unique opportunity that Gamestop presents, kind of like all of us shitheads here. I think their involvement in the company will provide the necessary knowledge and experience needed to grow improve e-commerce sales. The business strategy from their October 2020 10-Q:

>**BUSINESS STRATEGY**  
>  
>In May of 2019, we announced our multi-year transformation initiative, which we refer to as GameStop Reboot to position GameStop on the correct strategic path and fully leverage our unique position and brand in the video game industry. Our strategic plan is anchored on the following tenets.  
>  
>***Optimize the core business.*** Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations across the organization, including cost restructuring, inventory management optimization, adding and growing high margin product categories, and rationalizing the global store base. Prioritizing efforts to optimize the store base and improve the fundamental operations of the business yielded the net closure of 321 stores in fiscal 2019, 461 stores year-to-date in fiscal 2020, and included both the divestiture of the Simply Mac business and wind down of underperforming operations in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Improved inventory management drove a significant increase in inventory turns and as a result, in working capital, while an intense focus on organization structure and expense reductions yielded a $315.9 reduction in reported Selling, General and Administrative costs year-to-date in fiscal 2020.  
>  
>***Build a frictionless digital ecosystem.*** Develop and deploy a frictionless consumer facing digital first omni-channel environment, including the recent relaunch and customer experience enhancements within GameStop.com, the launch of a completely new GameStop App, as well as the optimization of our retail store footprint to maximize our customer reach more broadly across all channels and provide them the full spectrum of content and access to products they desire, however, wherever and whenever they want to shop. Enhancements to the user shopping experience and improved omni-channel capabilities, including expanded delivery and payment options, yielded an increase in e-commerce sales of over 430% through the third fiscal quarter of 2020.  
>  
>***Become the social / cultural hub for gaming.*** Create the social and cultural hub for games and entertainment and expand GameStop’s addressable market through category and product expansion to offer the most comprehensive product offering across the GameStop omni-channel platform. Our customers are increasing their engagement across the spectrum of games, entertainment and technology and our focus remains to meet those expanding needs.  
>  
>***Transform vendor partnerships.*** Transform our vendor and partner relationships to unlock additional high-margin revenue streams through an expanded suite of product and service offerings to optimize the lifetime value of every customer.  
>  
>Connected to our transformation efforts, we have incurred and continue to incur severance, store closure costs and expenses for consultants and advisors. See ""Consolidated Results from Operations—Selling, General and Administrative Expenses"" for further information.  
>  
>We continually review and prioritize our capital needs and are committed to making investments in our infrastructure to drive our business plans and realize on our transformation initiatives. Key areas of investment include improving the presentation and content as well as the functionality, general search and navigation across our customer facing digital channels; improving customer data integration and customer relations management capabilities; continuing to enhance service offerings to our customers; continuing to strengthen and deepen our information technology, analytics, marketing and e-commerce groups; and creating more flexible fulfillment options designed to improve our delivery capabilities and reduce our shipping costs. These and other investments are expected to, among other things, provide a seamless and compelling customer experience across our omni-channel retail platform.

* I still think shorts did not cover, red days are meaningless short ladders, there's probably counterfeit shares floating around, and media fuckery trying to stop a huge squeeze. But ***totally forgetting*** all that for a second, when the fuck did every single analyst on wall street start believing that fundamentals are the only thing that matters looking at stock price? A ton of startups and tech companies that IPO trade wildly higher than their fundamentals. A big reason for this is the emerging potential of their industry and investor belief in executive leadership, look at Elon and renewable energy or Portnoy and mobile sports betting. Why should people treat a restructuring company with good liquidity, great executive leadership, and [in an emerging industry](https://www.statista.com/topics/868/video-games/#dossierSummary__chapter2) any differently than we treat exciting startups or tech companies that aren't profitable? What's the difference between a company going through a significant and well calculated transformation vs a young new company IPOing?
* Based on all of my fundamental analysis, I feel comfortable setting a price target and sell limit of $69,420.69, cause stonk. I'm so behind on my work from today because I can't stop thinking about gamestonk and watching the price and volume on Think or Swim. Diamond hands forever but I need a break for a few days. Let me know if my DD is shit, and someone please message me if we hit my PT this week and/or if Steve Cohen gets sent to Rikers, ty and power to the playerzzz

They've been illegally ""closing out"" their short positions and if we hold they will 100% get fucked. There is far more nefarious shit at play.**

So this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME. This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above ~120% short interest still. I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close >50% of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week. This got me digging around to figure out what's up.

I started by looking into GME failed to delivers (i.e. short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock) for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan, GME had ~1.2 MILLION failed to delivers. This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying.

What was interesting though, is that of that ~1.2million, ~700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period. I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months. It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road.

Having spent some time looking at the pattern, it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in, then a small chunk of coverage, then another large amount, and so on. To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article: https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf

In it, a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME:

""Assuming that XYZ (e.g. GME) is a hard to borrow security (e.g. apes holding strong), and that Trader A (Melvin), or its broker-dealer, is unable (apes again) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer’s close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as “reset transactions,” in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm’s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.""

It's almost like a play by play of what we've seen (in combination with the ladder attacks). My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th.

I 100% think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud. In fact, I would bet all my money on it - oh wait, I did 96 GME @ 290.

I am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail.

Not a financial adviser, I eat paint chips for dinner

EDIT: Ok, so I've been reading some comments and I wanted to clear a couple things up:

* The failed to deliver number is reported cumulatively. So if you sum everything for the Jan time period it'd come out incorrectly as 5 million. What I'm doing is summing all the *debits* to get an aggregate view of all the failed to delivers in the time range. This process is validated and discussed in other /r/wsb posts

* I know ETF's could have been redeemed by some MM's to gather up GME stock. However I'm not convinced there is enough GME held in ETF's to be a significant factor. Someone in the comments reported this amount to be about ~10M. We would know if a bunch of ETF's rebalanced and dumped GME.

* My number for the Ortex short interest was incorrect, I got mixed around when I wrote this initially. The short interest reported by Ortex on Friday morning was ~80%. The 120 figure for S3 was correct. 

* Please checkout the linked DD - it goes into much more detail and covers things far better than I can. 

* Share this post and the related DD. We need to hold wall street accountable if this is true and I think that starts by spreading the word. 

* I'm going to continue to dig into this tonight / tomorrow. Look forward to a new post tomorrow evening.

I ran this calculation after seeing different AMC short interest figures on various websites. ***I believe true AMC short interest is actually 10-15%***, which is significantly lower than what Market Watch, Yahoo Finance, etc. are saying (79% on Market Watch, 38% on Yahoo Finance, at the time of writing this post).

**Since AMC's Q3’20 filing which was released on 11/05/20, they’ve issued a shit ton of shares through the below means, which I don't think these finance websites are accounting for:**

1. Raising $917mm in debt and equity through December and January; in a 1/22/201 filing they stated they had 287.3mm Class A shares outstanding ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/amc-says-bankruptcy-off-the-table-after-raising-more-than-900-million.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/amc-says-bankruptcy-off-the-table-after-raising-more-than-900-million.html))
2. Silver Lake Partners (a now past investor) converting their debt to equity and selling out last week, represented 44.2mm new Class A shares hitting the market ([https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake-idUSKBN29Z00E](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake-idUSKBN29Z00E))
3. Upcoming automatic conversion of Class B shares to Class A shares held by Dalian Wanda, a Chinese investor, represents 46.1mm new Class A shares that will hit the market soon (page S-18, [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf)).

Silver Lake then sold all those shares into the market last week. 5,666,000 of the Class B Common Stock outstanding then got cancelled as part of this conversion -> [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/1517ecab-0e77-4700-bb90-b6ebb60e7648.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/1517ecab-0e77-4700-bb90-b6ebb60e7648.pdf), page 2 || [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/5fe2dc45-30a6-4e45-8c67-36015d973df1.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/5fe2dc45-30a6-4e45-8c67-36015d973df1.pdf), page 12
3. Looks like \~44.7mm shares are sold short
4. Total shares outstanding (excl. Wanda conversion and 50MM filing) = 287,276,558 + 44,422,860 = 331,699,418
5. Total shares outstanding (incl. Wanda conversion and 50MM filing (which they will probably complete given the high stock price)) = 331,699,418 + 51,796,784 - 5,666,000 + 50,000,000 = 427,830,202
6. Looks like \~3.0 shares are held by management / insiders, so float and short interest on #4 above = 328,704,636 / 13.6% short interest; and on #5 above = 424,835,420 / 10.5% short interest

***In summary, I think AMC is way overhyped and those looking for a short squeeze may still realize one, but at a much lower magnitude than they might believe. Focus should be on forcing the GME short squeeze, which still looks to have +100% short interest.***

Appreciate any and all discussion. My thoughts are my own, this is not financial advice.

&#x200B;

**Edit 1:** I updated the link reference for AMC filing to issue another 50mm shares into the market.

**Edit 2:**

I've been getting some questions on why Yahoo Finance and Market Watch are wrong. Here are my thoughts:

We are all using the same number of shares short, so it's a matter of how you calculate shares outstanding and float. My guess is these free, generic finance websites use a very standard method of calculating short interest and apply it to all companies. They're not reading through filings and fine-tuning their calculations to be specific to each company.

**Yahoo Finance** ([https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)): In Footnote 5, they state Shares Outstanding (and then I ASSUME Float as well) is based off the most recent quarterly or annual report. Their 287.28mm shares lines up with my #1. So it doesn't include Silver Lake's conversion of debt to equity, Dalian Wanda's upcoming conversion of Class B to Class A shares, or AMC's filing to sell an additional 50mm shares last week.

**Market Watch** ([https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)): I can't figure out how they calculate 56.57mm public float, but their shares outstanding are the same 287.28mm as my #1. So even in the worst case scenario, if you believe my more conservative shares outstanding calculation of 331.7mm (point #5 instead of #6 to be conservative), that's an extra 44.4mm shares, which when added to Market Watch's float of 56.57mm shares, equals 100.97mm shares in the float and thus 44.3% short interest, which is significantly lower than the 79.0% they're showing. But still, I don't necessarily agree with their float calculation and can't figure out how they get to 56.57mm."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|['AMC', 'GME']|['AMC', 'GME']|['AMC', 'AMC', 'FOCUS', 'ON', 'I', 'AMC', 'I', 'AMC', 'I', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'A', 'AMC', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'AMC', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'MM', 'MM', 'I', 'AMC', 'GME', 'I', 'AMC', 'I', 'SSUME', 'B', 'A', 'I', 'I']|['AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'GME', 'AMC']

Well, today was quite a day, both for the standard GME and for my new favorite stock, IFF. 

TLDR: Buy IFF, there is the potential for massive short squeeze; Gamma squeeze at $150; and earnings multiple expansion to due merger with a DuPont subsidiary.

Well, today IFF closed at $130, on strong volume. Interestingly, there we extremely strong resistance to the standard laser afternoon short ladder (started at 2:50pm). There must be a whale buying who chose or hold the stock above $130 for the close.

The further good news is there is still low volatility on this stock, so the options remain affordable, for now. 

And, in regards to the Feb 19 $150 strike calls, volume was 40,000 with 177,000 open. Will be interesting to see if those purchases were to for open interest, or was someone moving them down to March.

Overall, it is still looking good for a short squeeze, and it is only 15% away from a monster Gamma squeeze at $150.

So, yes, hold GME, yes, I know there are counterfeit GME shares. I don't see how the counterfeit shares will help me make money though. 

This one, on the other hand, I expect to rise rapidly, with a big pop up after it gets past $150.

Yes,of course I have positions on IFF. And no, this isn't investment advice, just a recommendation to check it out yourself."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082633.csv|DueDiligence|['IFF', 'HUGE']|['IFF']|['GME', 'IFF', 'IFF', 'IFF', 'IFF', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'IFF']|['GME', 'IFF', 'IFF', 'IFF', 'IFF', 'GME', 'GME', 'IFF']

Forget about squozes and voodoo ass candlesticks. *#Ben Graham gang #*. There was a great post re: the company's product line up [here](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0a1p5/the_full_dd_on_bb_an_elon_muskjeff_bezos_sandwich/), make sure to check that out if you haven’t already.

My approach is to look at $BB from a ***strategic*** financial lens. First off, multiples off earnings are misleading, esp. w/ a company like BB where one-time and nonrecurring items are present and where there is a premium for growth vs. steady-state earnings. So as any Wall street spreadsheet monkey would do, I spread some comparables on earnings. Basically – How does the market value similar businesses? ?

No shit BB is not a phone company anymore. They are, if you’ve been paying any attention at all, an endpoint protection company. What is endpoint protection? Endpoints are basically computers, phones, but massively now also IoT – Your smart TV is an endpoint, so is your dumb refrigerator now that has to connect to wifi, and terrifyingly so is your car, your airplane, and stuff where if shit goes wrong the result is worse than not being able to double fist another helping of chocolate ice cream.

Almost every electronic device at this point that relies on internet access is an endpoint, with corresponding security challenges. So what does this mean? It means we can take a look at ***other endpoint protection / digital security*** companies, see how the market values them, and see what that implies for $BB based on its own revenue.

See below a quick spread. Based on the revenue multiples currently ascribed to comparables to Blackberry, Blackberry has a target price of **at least** **$60 / share.** And this is only if it is the average of its peers. I believe it is better for all the reasons previous posters have mentioned.

https://preview.redd.it/4q73p1tjize61.png?width=635&format=png&auto=webp&s=863fed2b3532f8b371a88ecb7fc438cd52fe0216

Long story short – Blackberry already has the infrastructure, moat, and products in place for growth. **IF MORE PEOPLE PERCEIVED BLACKBERRY AS WHAT IT IS TODAY - A FUTURE-FACING ENDPOINT PROTECTION BUSINESS WITH GIANT ASS MOATS IN FANTASTIC END MARKETS (E.G. MOBILITY / TRANSPORT), ITS SHARES WOULD ROCKET, SIMPLY BASED ON WHERE “COMPARABLES” ARE TRADING.**

In other words, ***the Company is a diamond still with a coating of shit*** (lack of public understanding of its current business). ***In fact its inclusion as a simple meme stock may have only added an extra layer of shit***. John Chen (look up his resume), is a world class operator, and frankly almost too low key for his own good. Personally as an Asian, I sympathize – sometimes the community focuses too much on keeping their heads down to work hard, and less than they should on messaging! Imagine if he meme'd like Elon!!!

No matter how good (or bad) the fundamentals are, you need a catalyst for the stock to moon. So, although I think it was a mixed blessing for BB to have been part of the scrum last week, there is a high likelihood of an inflection point in the perception of the company these next few weeks. You also saw the post on [reflexivity](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/) (basically, stonks up can make company good, not just company good make stonks up).

The best part is - **even if it doesn't moon, $$BB will steadily grow and develop. Imagine -** **Base case of going into orbit, with extreme upside of potential based on what's going on in the markets right now. FOr those of you non-retards, that's called** **POSITIVE EXPECTED VALUE**\*\*.\*\* **YOu don't have to try to ""time the top"" with this stock, because it's got fundamentals / non-technical reasons supporting the stock.** ***There's a reason John Chen took his bonuses entirely in stock the last few years.***

**TLDR: $BB = Buy Blackberry.**

Disclaime r - My day job is actually private investing (so unlike many of you monkes I actually will have W2 income this year), I am still a retard. I just like the stock and have been 💎🤲 since 2018.

Imagine you’re John Chen. Sauntering down the hallway, with your 50 pound dick grazing the velveteen carpet with each step. You hear the guttural screams coming out of sales. You walk by the engineers, and gaze upon the latest widget as they kowtow before your bespecled grandeur. You hear about the customers who sing your praises, and the (much fewer) ones who tell you your product sucks donkey balls... But we (the retards @ WSB or frankly the dubmasses @ seeking alpha and even JP Morgan equity coverage) don’t know the details any of this, only dry ass reports that come out every quarter.

So, other than hacking into John’s brain (not recommended), what can we do? We can suckle at the teat of Twitter announcements, and sometimes that’s fun but usually it’s PR driven (unless it comes from Papa Chen’s account in which case suckle away).

But boy oh boy wouldn’t it be great if we could know the things P. Chiddy does. What new things are in development. Big new sales in the pipeline. Whether the company is hiring (or shrinking), and in what areas….Wait. For the last thing we actually can!

thanks to the grotesquely fat (and very rich, no offense Gabe) founder of a soul-crushing professional network called LinkedIn. Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So let’s see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?

To start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If you’re a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If you’re growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they don’t think they need, and last time I checked $BB’s CFO wasn’t completely retarded. Now, it’s important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c they’re growing, duh) and vice versa.

FANG isn’t a perfect comp (I’ll get to the others in a sec), but **serves as a good proxy of a “baseline growthy” tech.** No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking. See below.

&#x200B;

# IMPLICATION NUMBER #1 - $$BB COMPARES FAVORABLY TO FANG IN TERMS OF HEADCOUNT-IMPLIED GROWTH. IF YOU SAID “$BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG”, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOU’D BE RIGHT!!

“But wait,” you say. “growthinvestor123 you fucking idiot, [didn’t you just compare $BB to CRWD, ZS, SAIL, and PANW](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/) to justify a **$60 / share** price target for $BB? I want to see the ratios for those.” Ok you, got me. See below, headcount-implied growth is higher for endpoint security comparables.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eaz3begzize61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d01221903b3c50a6838710f32daa173035eb9e92

“Hah,” you say smugly. “Those other endpoint security businesses blow $BB out of the water, $BB sucks”.

No, you fucking idiot. If a simple headcount ratio without context was all it took I’d be rich instead of handsome like mommy tells me.

$BB went through [**round**](https://channeldailynews.com/news/layoffs-hit-blackberry-in-waterloo/28015) after [**round**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=blackberry+layoffs&atb=v224-1&ia=web&iai=r1-3&page=1&sexp=%7B%22cdrexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22artexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prodexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prdsdexp%22%3A%22c%22%2C%22biaexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22msvrtexp%22%3A%22b%22%7D) of painful layoffs as it shifted from being a handset business to what it is today. Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a **history**, and that is a blessing and a curse.

**Remember**, Daddy chen’s primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other??? And these smart monkes who were retained – Well, no need to make a job posting for that role anymore, right?

# IMPLICATION #2 – BLACKBERRY HAD > 20K EMPLOYEES. UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS. HAVING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES QUICKLY LIKE CERTAIN COMPETITORS

This brings me to the final part of our headcount analysis. Let’s look at those endpoint security comparables again. Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Let’s look at two two non-retard quotes –

***""I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company."" Steve Jobs***

***“If your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it’s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.” Peter Thiel***

I was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BB’s Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales. See below

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6nog6m62jze61.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb26266cbef428abb3152f1b9077c1a0daee07b0

Even as a $BB bull, I didn’t expect the discrepancy to be so large.

# IMPLICATION #3 – BLACKBERRY ACTUALLY IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING / IT FOCUSED COMPANY RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS. IN MANY WAYS IT IS MORE OF A “START-UP”. EVEN WITH FINANCIAL PRESSURE, JOHNNY CHEN RETAINED TECHNICAL TALENT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE COMPANY’S FUTURE, AND VALUATION ???

**TLDR: BB IS NOT A ROCKET SHIP. IT IS A LONG RANGE SHUTTLE, CAPABLE OF BURSTS OF SPEED, PACKED TO THE GILLS WITH RETARDS AND TERRAFORMING EQUIPMENT AND HEADING TO MARS.**

**The Shorts - The Side Show**

Let’s be honest, the real reason anyone is in WSB right now is to fist shorts. BCRX, however, is also a company that needs to gap up to reach fair value.  Fist the shorts and hold the gains.

Biocryst has a high and steadily growing institutional ownership [currently reported at 71%](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bcrx/institutional-holdings). Biocryst has a float of 175m (124m of which are held by institutions), who are buying every share they can and not likely to sell any time soon.  This leaves 56m tradable shares. [The shorts have 30m shares or 70% of the tradable float.](http://nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=ShortInterest) This is not as big as the $GME naked short taken on by u/DeepFuckingValue. But, we think this is a stock that if it gaps up can hold the gain based on value. Institutions run an algorithm almost every day and short the stock (check the charts). We can make these fuckers squirm with the slightest effort.

**Orladeyo - The Prelude**

Orladeyo has recently been approved in the [US](https://biopharmajournal.com/2020/12/07/biocryst-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaqbcrx-receives-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-in-preventing-hae-attacks/) and [Japan](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/biocryst-bcrx-wins-japanese-approval-for-hae-drug-orladeyo-2021-01-25) to treat Hereditary Angioedema(European approval expected shortly). HAE is a rare disease that affects roughly 1/50,000 people, or about \~25,000 people in the three regions mentioned previously.

Orladeyo treats a rare disease and that means the medication is expensive. It costs [$485,000/year in the US](https://endpts.com/biocryst-wins-approval-for-hae-pill-and-charges-half-a-million-dollars-but-will-anyone-take-it/#:~:text=Six%20years%20after%20the%20FDA,BioCryst%20has%20notched%20another%20approval.&text=Despite%20inferior%20efficacy%2C%20BioCryst%20will,had%20projected%20a%20%24300%2C000%20tag.) and will roughly cost half of that in Japan and the EU. The company has projected they will capture 40% of the market [(page 15)](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/bcd71bf3-ef71-4803-81c4-edd4e33ebb38).  Capturing 40% of the market is a share price of [$70 when trading at a reasonable (if not conservative) 7x revenue multiple.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLvclUzTqCitwKfawL7kGCLquJxA2T7IJKLg52VWotE/edit?usp=sharing) Work your own numbers and you’ll find SP should be more than $9 and the current market cap of 1.6 billion. FDA approval of Orladeyo enabled BioCryst to cross a bridge from a small unprofitable research company to expanding [commercial biotech](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393550-biocryst-time-to-switch-hats-mid-cap-fits-now-maybe-large-cap) now engaged in execution.

**Factor D -  The Main Event**

Factor D is the blockbuster.  Full stop.  The company is already pursuing PNH but has indicated their intended subsequent targets for this drug. They’re small targets like “Lupus” and “IGA Nephropathy” along with[ 6 others (page 24)](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/41ee0771-0acc-479e-a39e-2842101c6aa9) and it’s already being hailed as [“best in class”](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3087617&headline=BCRX-BioCryst-has-potential-bestinclass-PNH-treatment-says-JMP-Securities)

So what’s this look like money wise?  Alexion’s drugs SOLIRIS® and ULTOMIRIS® are the current treatment for PNH those [make up 4.3B of their 5B revenues.](https://ir.alexion.com/node/22191/pdf)  AstraZeneca just bought them out for a whopping 39B.  If Factor D receives same valuation, that alone puts SP at $222 given our float.  [The sky is truly the limit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLvclUzTqCitwKfawL7kGCLquJxA2T7IJKLg52VWotE/edit?usp=sharing) over the next 24-48 months.  The point is, the company is ready to gap up on merit, but is being held back by high short activity.

**Galidesivir - The Wild Card**

If you aren’t already excited, maybe you’ll be excited by a drug [that provides 90% protection against Ebola](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320203179_Efficacy_of_Galidesivir_against_Ebola_Virus_Disease_in_Rhesus_Monkeys) when dosed 72 hours post exposure. Huge Ebola outbreak? BioTerror attack in a major city?  Think humanity might end in a pandemic more lethal than covid with people hemorrhaging blood from their eyes? No problem. Just distribute the [galidesivir](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/galidesivir) and most everyone will be protected. (Animal studies suggest high protection against [Zika](https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/4/suppl_1/S55/4294108), Yellow Fever, Marburg, [Tick Borne Encephalitis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31142664/) and others). 

Why didn’t we already have this drug?  That’s anyone’s guess, but politics seems to have something to do with it.  No one can yet determine the value or ultimate use of galidesivir as it is tied up in government development contracts. The company has already [stated](https://ir.biocryst.com/events/event-details/biocryst-third-quarter-2020-conference-call) that it is developing galidesivir for government contracts and shareholders seem to have little to do with this. So, we’ll just call this the sleeping wild card.

**FOP- The Feel Good Drug**

This is not a money maker. But, in case you haven’t found a soft spot for this company, they appear close to a first time cure for an extremely rare disease called [FOP](https://www.biocryst.com/our-pipeline/fop-program/). It slowly (and painfully) cripples children when their joints fuse together with excess bone. Children affected by FOP often end up wheelchair bound by age 11. Can’t tell you this drug will be a money maker as the affected population is too small. But, gosh, don’t you want the company to succeed?

**The Competition - The Class Clowns**

Disease:  Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)

For the prophylactic (preventative) market, the competitors are Cinryze, Takhzyro (from Takeda) which are IVF and subcutaneous injections respectively. Haegarda (CSL Behring) has a subcutaneous injection as well. Orladeyo recently received [FDA approval](https://biopharmajournal.com/2020/12/07/biocryst-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaqbcrx-receives-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-in-preventing-hae-attacks/) to be the first and only oral prophylactic treatment for HAE.

The patents of the competitors expire in 2032 and no generics are expected on the market before 2032. Orladeyo was granted extended patent protection until [2037](https://ir.biocryst.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-composition-matter-patent-allowance-extends-protection). [Royalty Pharma](https://www.royaltypharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/royalty-pharma-acquires-royalty-interest-orladeyo-and-bcx9930) did a deep dive on BioCryst’s expected Orladeyo revenues when it agreed to royalty financing that enabled BCRX to fast track Factor D development and expand it to 8 clinical indications.  

Disease: Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) 

Alexion holds the sole drug Soliris and its spin off Ultomiris (both IVF C5 inhibitors) to treat the rare blood disorder PNH. Alexion has market exclusivity until 2025 for Soliris. [This activist letter ](http://www.elliottletters.com/alexion.pdf)and [this article](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/alexion-moves-from-cfo-clancy-and-his-legendary-caution-does-mean-more-m-a-coming) highlight that analysts believe the 39B purchase of Alexion was a fire sale due to mismanagement. If Factor D received at least the same discounted valuation as ALXN, that would mean its market cap would increase from 1.6B to 39B. Excited?

Factor D is expected not just to be equivalent to Soliris, but exceed it. BioCryst Medical Director Bill Sheridan believes Factor D will make competitors [“obsolete”](https://ir.biocryst.com/events/event-details/39th-annual-jp-morgan-healthcare-conference) as it cures patients earlier in the disease process than C5 and C3 inhibitors. Unlike competitors, Factor D will also be both an oral pill \*and\* a monotherapy. In other words, there’s not much competition. Also, PNH is only the first of 8 serious illnesses expected to be treated by Factor D.

**The Insiders**

Still not convinced? CFO Anthony Doyle joined BioCryst April 02, 2020. Four months after joining the company he used $220,320 of his own money to [purchase shares in BioCryst ATM.](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1808688.htm) As he is mortal like the rest of us, we assume CFO Anthony Doyle also pays taxes. Therefore, it appears as if he put the entirety of his after tax salary, for a whole year, into aligning himself with shareholders. Famed biotech investor Alex Denner has also been accumulating a passive position, ATM, right next to retail, [as recently as a couple weeks ago](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-bcrx-biocryst-pharmaceuticals-sarissa-capital-management-lp-sc-13g-2021-january-25-18652).

**Too Many Good Things?**

BCRX researched small molecules and crystalline structures for years.

**No More Shareholder Dilutions**

If your interest is perking, you’ll be happy to hear CEO John Stonehouse [promised(listen to question and answer section)](https://ir.biocryst.com/events/event-details/39th-annual-jp-morgan-healthcare-conference) there will be no shareholder dilutions, as all company operations are funded into 2023.

Here’s some DD for anybody who doesn’t eat breath and sleep only GME.


eBay, like most other online retailers, are going to have ludicrous numbers in this last quarter due to the holiday season. That’s just a given. 


I am an experienced eBay seller who on a weekly basis for the last few years, sells around 15-20 items. The last few months was ridiculous. Items which were posted that would have around 10 bids and 5-15 watchers, would have 25-30 with 20+ bids. The views on each item was double to tripe from early November until pretty much the last two weeks. 


Lots of volume, lots of selling, lots of 10% commissions for eBay. Now we all saw what happened with Apple, posting 100+ Billion in revenue this last earnings report and being down 3% the next day. That shit happens, I’m not a psychic with a magic ball. If the market is tanking, the market is tanking. Look at it this week. But I will say this, the volume on eBay isn’t why I’m going fucking hard in the calls. Here’s the real cherry on top:

eBay has now finally implemented a payment policy they have been working on for a long time. Every single one of my sales went through PayPal, along with everybody else. Every single god damn transaction PayPal got their dirty little claws into. Since I think like the beginning of eBay, it’s just been a given that they give PayPal millions of dollars every month to run their transactions.


Well guess what you mother fucker. Shit had changed. Since they have now implemented their STRAIGHT TO BANK ACCOUNT POLICY, PayPal doesn’t even exist. The money goes, you guessed it, straight to your account. They even have their own return feature which they deal with themselves now, instead of putting funds into hold on PayPal. eBay allows you to chose when you get paid and in what frequency. For example, I have mine setup for each Tuesday of every week. 

This is going to and has already saved them MILLIONS in fees. Papa Musk has already moved on from PayPal, it’s time we do the same.


Oh, did I mention all the new payment platforms introduced as well? I bought a Pokémon card the other day without gay as shit PayPal but through god damn Apple Pay. It was way too easy. You can also link credit cards, bank accounts, whatever. It’s 2021.


eBay posts earnings in a few days, Wednesday after close. Do what you want. If the stock goes down, call me a retard and make fun of me. If the stock goes up, fuck off and thank me later. Look at what it did today. I’ll probably sell a third of my calls on Wednesday for an IV hedge as well. Play at your own risk.

I came across TSM Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturers which had just over 50% market share. Their biggest customer is Apple. 

https://csimarket.com/stocks/competitionSEG2.php?code=TSM

Now, I couldn’t believe the numbers I saw for TSM. I figured every site was wrong because the following cannot possibly be true: 
Market Cap- 571 billion
2020 revenue - 1.4 Trillion (yes trillion). the revenue is up 30% from 2019 (yes during a pandemic). 
Earnings- 530billion.  

This means that they are trading at 1:1 P/E ratio. 

Compare that to AMD (106bil market cap - 2.5billion earnings - 38 P/E and NVDA 321marketcap - 2.8bil earnings - 140 P/E.
Intel has market cap of $230bil - $20bil earnings - 11 p/E

So shouldn’t TSM have a market cap of at least 5 trillion?? How is no one talking about the fact that their revenue during a pandemic is 1.4 trillion with profit margin of 40%??? 

I think there are some seriously sweet tendies to be made. The IV is pretty low and you can get 2022 calls with a 200 strike for $5. Or a 2023 call with 200strike for $12. 

Someone please explain how this is possible and what I am missing. This is a no brainer. 

Also, for the first time ever, TSM will be building a plant in the USA

They began launching the ""McPlant"" in Denmark and Sweden this month.

A friend of mine discovered the ingredients list of the McPant, Mcdonalds big new plant based burger. He cross examained it agianst the BYND meat burger, note...Mcdonalds and BYND have yet to anounce any partnerships on their McPlant Burger. After futher examination and many hours of labor he established the first ever ""Meatless Meat Comparison Chart"" or MMCC.

As you can see from the results, he found that there is a 87.5% match in raw ingredients which emcompasses both the Beyond Burger and McPlant Burger. This essentially means there's a partnership with McDonalds and Beyond which is yet to be announced or discovered. The proposed theory is Beyond Meat will be supplying all of the McPlant Burgers in a massive deal.

# There are likely several million new synthetic longs of $GME, diluting the market, that were created on 01/28/21.

They were created by a market maker (or possibly several market makers) to stop the beginning of a short squeeze that would have bankrupted hedge funds if a margin call hit them, which ultimately could have financially impacted those market makers once liability for the shares was transferred. These shares weren't borrowed from anyone. They're imaginary. Pure fiction. A promise only a handful of entities can make.

The reason they did this was to buy time to save their own asses. [The reason they were allowed to do this is because regulations let them](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html).

The creators of those shares have 21 days to deliver. Until then, they aren't paying interest. There isn't a public record of their creation -- the closest insight we have to the number of synthetic longs in existence for $GME are the [failure-to-deliver numbers](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/), and $GME is a major outlier in that field. A fucking terrifying outlier.

We aren't bleeding out a hedge fund by holding. Melvin very likely *is* out of their position after losing half of their fund. There aren't 'new shorts replacing the old'. Instead, a buffer of imaginary stock was created by a market maker to 'flatten the curve' when a massive number of shorts had to cover once retail buyers started rushing in.

---------

# That's why you aren't seeing short interest increase even though there aren't any short shares left to borrow.

**These assholes are praying that in the next month, retail buyers get scared, bored, or distracted.** They're spreading FUD, attacking with short ladders, hoping you watch the short interest drop and think it's over. They're counting on you to sell your $GME at a bargain rate so you can pay rent, because they think *you're just fucking retail scum betting on a shit company,* and they've been playing this game longer than you've been alive.

They're also counting on you to obsess over things you can measure that they can hide. They want you to set rules and limits on when you're going to run away.

---------

# Simultaneous to the creation of these synthetic longs, DTCC increased collateral requirements on 01/28/21 to purchase $GME to 100%.

This led smaller brokers like Robinhood to restrict trading, depressing the price, conveniently making it less expensive for market makers to recover their synthetic longs. 

**The people that pushed this collateral increase knew exactly what would happen**, because *it's their job* to know what the impact will be when they make changes like this.

DTCC openly stated they increased collateral requirements for $GME to reduce risk to their organization. **DTCC recognized financial liability in this squeeze could eventually reach clearinghouses if the market makers went bankrupt.** They know exactly what the failure-to-deliver numbers mean for this security. 

It's possible that DTCC created new collateral requirements in coordination with the flood of synthetic longs explicitly to make it easier to recover those shares. It is also possible these actions were taken without any coordination with market makers, because DTCC knows it could have dampened and stretched out a squeeze through this act alone.

**Their strategy is to stretch out a short squeeze into a 'long high' they can recover from if retail shares are sold over time, since retail can't buy them back.**

And the people working at DTCC likely rationalized this was 'the right thing to do' -- to prevent a systemic failure that could have impacted the entire stock market -- because preventing systemic failures is the only reason organizations like DTCC exist.

Meanwhile, Robinhood -- the smallest player in the game -- honestly DTCC's buttboy in this scheme -- is going to be grilled by Congress over this shit.

---------

# Did you think we were the only ones that saw a black swan event coming when we bought shares?

The root problem is there are several players in the market capable of creating new shares without paying interest, capable of restricting trading -- and they all face severe financial liabilities if a squeeze happens. They want to turn the squeeze into a slow burn so the damage doesn't hit them.

If we continue to hold, a squeeze could happen sometime around or after Feb 18th, or another market maker could create *even more* synthetic longs to dilute the market, passing the hot potato. This could make their problem even worse once *those shares* are bought and held.

This could continue for an extremely long period of time until a financial regulator steps in and forces them to buy the shares they've sold.

---------

**TL;DR**: 

WSB is being made into a fall guy for the collapse of the market due to the creation of a massive number of preexisting synthetic longs that were bought and held. To fix it, market makers decided to make more, but their cure is also a poison they can't stop taking.

**Strategy**: 

Hold your positions, buy at any price you can afford to hold forever, and hope that retail owns more shares than the total number that exist for $GME. Contact the SEC and ask them to investigate and to halt trading of $GME -- time is on your side if the clock ticks down the deadlines for market makers, while the stock cannot be sold by paper hands.

This is not financial advice, blah blah blah, suck my dick SEC.

&#x200B;

Simply put, the S3 Short Interest data is probably fairly accurate. But it's not answering the relevant question.

&#x200B;

Anyone with any statistical background knows that asking the right question is as important as any analysis you do.

&#x200B;

For short interest there are two relevant questions:

1. What is the net exposure to a short in a hedge fund's portfolio?
2. How many shares still have yet to be bought that must be bought in order to cover?

&#x200B;

It is my belief that S3's data is answering the first question but not the second.

&#x200B;

Lately there has been a significant increase in volume for super OTM puts and super OTM calls. Selling a put is a bullish position and buying a call is a bullish position. However, the shares associated with these positions ARE NOT NECESSARILY PURCHASED YET. This is particularly true for selling a naked put.

&#x200B;

My thought is that hedge funds have begun selling a FUCK TON of otm naked puts. This creates some revenue for them and also, on paper, effectively closest their exposure to a short position. So, if you're short 100 shares and you sell a put (taking on the obligation to buy 100 shares at a certain, low, price, if the contract is exercised) you are effectively hedged. Thus as long as that contract is open, it may appear to S3's algorithms that the position is closed.

&#x200B;

The problem arises because those 100 shares linked to the sold put ARE NOT purchased yet if the hedge funds are selling naked puts. They are just floating about. So while the net exposure to short positions is reduced, the need to buy shares has not been alleviated.

&#x200B;

Perhaps the squeeze has been squoze. Perhaps not.

The float is only 50.65M shares.

There's 8.1M WSB degenerates.

Let's throw out some scenarios to show how we (just the WSB degenerates), not even counting the rest of retail, could in fact own 100% of the float -

1. Every degenerate owns GME (yes I know that's not at all realistic) -50.65M / 8.1M = 6.33 shares/degenerate
2. If only 50% of the degenerates own GME -50.65M / .50(8.1M) = 12.51 shares/each
3. If only 25% of the degenerates own GME -50.65M / .25(8.1M) = 25.01 shares/each
4. If only 10% of the degenerates own GME -50.65M / .10(8.1M) = 62.53 shares/each

Let that sink in. Yes I know a lot of you have much more than than 62.53 shares, and a lot have only 1 or 2 shares (or even a fraction of a share).

This doesn't take into account all of the retail that is not even on WSB that owns GME.

This doesn't take into account all of the shares Cohen and others have bought up.

Bottom line, we, retail, degenerates, autists, & retards, likely own nearly ALL OF THE FLOAT.

Hedge funds bought up the rest, holding it to squeeze their fellow assholes along with us.

I have previously brought you detailed analysis surrounding the capabilities of [Palantir](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l07ly5/dd_pltr_foundry_explanation_from_reformed_data/), [FireEye](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laki1v/feye_playing_tomorrows_fireeye_q4_earnings_based/) (check comments), and other cybersecurity vendors here in WSB. I have also written a [guide to understanding how propaganda and misinformation campaigns are being used to manipulate retail investors](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l928lr/obfuscation_misinformation_propaganda_and_gme/) and what you can do to help yourself.

Anyway, moving past establishing credibility, here is my analysis on why I am bullish about the security posture surrounding the Blackberry QNX operating system in comparison to other competitors in the embedded RTOS environment.

# What is RTOS

RTOS is Real-Time Operating System. Most operating systems do not need to perform tasks within predictable computation timeframes, as we tend not to notice any performance difference. This is why it takes either 7 minutes or 11 lifetimes to download Winrar. With an RTOS, the primary applications are time-sensitive or mission-critical operating systems. These include power plants, water treatment facilities, dams, vehicles, drones, and further applications. If your system does not operate in a predictable fashion within set timeframes and capacities, you cannot rely on it for ensuring your dam doesn't overflow, your autonomous vehicles does not crash, or your drone can stay afloat in the air.

# Start with Monolithic OS

Most RTOS are monolithic as far as their OS architecture goes. Generally, systems are built into Kernel and User land. A monolith tends to control all system management within Kernel-land with user applications running in Userland. The issue with this approach is reliability. Any individual failure can potentially crash the OS, which is an unacceptable condition for many of the above applications.

In addition, trying to modify the monolithic OS is difficult to do without a complete shutdown. Shutting down a drone or train mid-journey is not feasible. For cybersecurity purposes, the attack surface is enormous as any individual part of the system (including applications) can affect the reliability of the OS.

Good news is that they're more performant though!

# MicroKernel

QNX is a MicroKernel architecture. The MicroKernel only does process isolation / memory management / task switching. All other standard OS operations (file system, drivers, networking, etc) are performed in UserLand instead.

This architecture is useful because it means that:

* Individual component failures will not compromise the entire OS. So for drones, a bug in a camera application or in the network traffic will not affect the flight of the drone. This is pertinent in the context of power plants, dams, military equipment, and autonomous/electric vehicles.
* When a component fails, it is easy to detect the point of failure. Monolithic kernels are difficult to trace faults in, especially as services get coupled together.
* Live restoration, if a component fails it can be restored without taking the system offline.
* Isolation, processes do not share memory or processing space, preventing many classes of memory manipulation bugs / security flaws such as buffer overflows, use after free, etc.
* Systems can be built to scale or share workload across multiple Userland apps, potentially preventing the crash entirely at the cost of degraded performance.

So look, the architecture of the QNX system puts it in a great position compared to other monolithic kernels in the embedded OS space.

# Key QNX benefits

Memory Protection - Typically, an OS assigns a block of memory to a process for it to store either data or instructions. QNX assigns a process a block of virtual memory, that is then mapped to physical memory with spatial separation between each block. This means that you cannot reliably change the operation of the program or read the data effectively when given physical access. Sure, ASLR, Canaries, and the Guard space do exist in modern OS's, but in embedded space memory is much tighter so this is a key benefit!

CPU Scheduling - CPU's use a variety of scheduling algorithms to give processes different weights for execution. This can become problematic when critical processes end up being stalled because low priority processes are hogging CPU time due to bugs or manipulation (such as regex backtracking for validation). QNX uses adaptive partioning which basically enforces that each application is partitioned to have a predetermined set of resources such as memory, filespace, or cpu time. This makes it difficult to starve any particular critical process of resources.

Safety & Compliance - The OS has pre-configured designs ready for compliance with EC 61508 (industrial), IEC 61511, EN 50128 (rail), IEC 62304 (medical) or ISO 26262 (automotive) industry standards. These are rigorous engineering standards that are designed to enforce strict safety measures, monitoring for faults, and procedures for operating. Compliance with any of these is a long and arduous process, which BB has been working on for a long time. Other embedded system vendors have not met these standards yet, or have only chosen to focus on their key industries.

Security - Normal Standards like secure boot, integrity validation of all programs prior to execution, address space validation, application isolation and sandboxing, data and network and inter-process access control, and execution of everything from userland (no root) are all other benefits I don't have time to get too deep into.

This is a good blogpost that details how the microkernel is able to quickly identify deviations from the standard, apply logging, and pinpoint where to analyze further for performance or security remediation.

[https://devblog.blackberry.com/en/2020/04/securing-the-clipboard](https://devblog.blackberry.com/en/2020/04/securing-the-clipboard)

This was in response to an iOS update that showed when applications were accessing a users clipboard. Tiktok and facebook were accessing the clipboard p. much every second. Conspiracy theorists would say that Tiktok was harvesting user clipboard data hoping for PII or credentials. Regardless, BB was prepared for this attack vector already as demonstrated by this quick blog post as a response.

[https://devblog.blackberry.com/en/2019/10/https-versus-blackberry-spark-communication-service](https://devblog.blackberry.com/en/2019/10/https-versus-blackberry-spark-communication-service)

Building their own competitor to TLS, the standard for secure web communication. The web's based off of a Request/Response model, but BB allows for PubSub, Voice, and Video amongst other secure data transmission methods. Looking into their encryption algorithm support, Argon2 stands out as it is a relatively recent (with low uptake) hashing algorithm.

# Summary

Overall, hope this gives you some confidence that BB are market leaders in the embedded OS space, as the microkernel architecture does set them apart when compared to competitors in the business, and their existing big enterprise relationships and 100% certification and compliance to safety/security standards should get them into many new critical infrastructure, military, drone, and electric vehicle embedded systems.

The biggest EV automaker is TESLA. Tesla is huge in demand, its factories is set up in Nevada. They all NEED LITHIUM to power their cars up.

$LAC lithium americas corp just got approval from govt for lithium mining in Thacker Pass. Thacker pass has the most lithium deposit in USA and its located in nevada and its merely only 200 miles away from Tesla factories. $LAC already mining lithium in the Argentina and few other places so they are already know what they are doing and own thacker pass location in Nevada.

They are projected to start mining lithium in January 2022 and construction is almost complete as much as 60 percent. They are now signing. parnerships which are under NDA and I reckon one of the partnerships is TESLA and other big automakers such as GM, Ford, Toyota etc.

Currently we dont have biggest lithium miners in US, so in order to rise big in this revolution, US govt is helping $LAC and probabaly $LAC being the biggest lithium miner in US is a great thing for its economy and its automakers economy. Lithium americas currently raised 400 million dollars at average price of $22, currently its trading under that, so its a discount for you, but it wont stay longer. Once the partnerships are announced, it will rise big, now is the time to buy and hold.

Lithium is the new oil, This is easily can go 40s --> 50s --> 60 ---> after the launch easily can be trading may be even north of 100s. If your grandfather or dad missed on OIL investment, this is the best thing up and running now, so now is the time to give a second look. Check out $LAC.

**Math Time:** In thinking about value, we hppen to enjoy simple convenience of a Nice Round Number. 101 million shares Outstanding. A $2 billion Market cap (almost exactly) $20 per share, $3 billion @ $30 per share and so on OR $40 per share to reach 4 bilion market cap. To ask ""is it possible $LAC could hit $40??????? ---> is to ask , could market could ever hit $4 billion.

In assesing value more specically, we can also enjoy the simplicity of approaching the company as sum of its part on two primary assets: 49 % interest in the Causchari-Olaroz brine project in Jujuy Province, Argentina (""CO"") AND a 100 % Interest in the Thacker Pass project in Nevada USA (""TP"")

Construction of CP is over 60 % COMPLETE already, and fully capitalized. Construction will complete Q4 2021, AND Lithium Production will begin Q1 January 2022 (11 months from now) at 2 Million Tons proven and probable reserve of battery grade lithium in Carbonate equivalent (""LCE""). Production capacity of 40,000 tons per annum (""TPA""). Operating cost of $3.579/Ton. A 40 year project Life.

Construction of TP, of course, has not started but underlying resource is well documented. 3.1 Million tons of LCE proven and probable. Production Capacity of 60,000 tpa. Operating Cost of Around $4,000/Ton. A 46 year project life.

Conservatively 80,000 Tpa of LCE X $12Lk/ton (LAC's assumed avg price) = $ 960 Million revenue minus $4k/ton (high end of cost of production) = $640 million EBITDA. But in my opinion, thats too LOW. We are on precipice of unprecedented surge in worldwide demand for LCE. Experts say Demand will in crease 10x IN Ten years, Some are saying 6x demand will increase by 2024 alone. LEC prices have already risen 50 % in 6 months but are still very depressed. If LCE recovers just to 2018 levels ($25k/Ton): 80k Tpax$25k/ton= 2.0 Billion revenue, $1.6 billion EBITDA.

As for what multiple should apply to these figures, your guess is as good as mine. For illustration, ALB boasts $ 3.34 Billion revenue, $853 EBITDA, A $19.18 billion Market Cap, fetching a trailing price/sales of 5.91, SQM has 1.78 billion revenue, $572 m EBITDA, a $14.87 billion Market cap, fetching a P/S 8.37. May be $LAC is lower, or higher, or somewhere in between. i leave it greater minds of Fellows here than my own mind to Project.

But if (1) despite Surging demand LCE Spot prices never rise a penny above $12k/ton and (2) we apply a very low 5x sales ration, fair value of LAC could be $4.8 billion , i.e $48/share. If LCE price recover to 2018 elvels we keep the same low 5x sales ratio fair price for LAC could be 10 billion, i.e $100/share. iF lac Fetches the same multiple as SQM (8.37 x sales) we get $16.74 Billion i.e $167/share. And if Worldwide Demand for battery grade lithium Carbonate Rockets beyond supply as anyone paying attention predicts it will.....That friends, is when ""2 DA MOON"" starts to sound apt."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082633.csv|DueDiligence|['$LAC', 'GGEST']|[]|['EV', 'EV', 'TESLA', 'NEED', 'THIUM', '$LAC', 'USA', '$LAC', 'NDA', 'I', 'TESLA', 'GM', 'US', 'US', '$LAC', '$LAC', 'US', 'OIL', '$LAC', 'A', 'OR', '$LAC', 'AND', 'USA', 'CP', 'PLETE', 'AND', 'A', 'TP', 'LCE', 'A', 'LCE', 'X', 'BITDA', 'LOW', 'LCE', 'IN', 'LEC', 'LCE', 'BITDA', 'ALB', 'BITDA', 'A', 'SQM', 'BITDA', 'S', '$LAC', 'LCE', 'LAC', 'LCE', 'LAC', 'F', 'SQM', 'DA']|['GM', 'CP', 'ALB', 'SQM', 'F', 'SQM']

I posted this TWNK long thesis in r/stocks, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lafmq2/long_thesis_on_hostess_brands_twnk_owner_of/), but think it has a home in r/options as well given the 15% short interest, low IV, cheap options, and potential for gamma squeeze. Appreciate any and all thoughts.

# TL;DR

**Hostess Brands (TWNK)** has high (\~15%) short interest (more than AMC or BB) setting the stage for a short squeeze, additional upside from a gamma squeeze, is an iconic brand, AND has a fundamentally sound business with strong cash flows and organic growth trading at a reasonable valuation. ***Not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade.***

# Intro

Sup guys. So I know a bunch of us are now looking for the next big opportunity to pile into. Unfortunately we probably won’t see a squeeze of GME’s magnitude for awhile since that kind of short interest is insanely rare, but I think we might have found an opportunity that is pretty low hanging fruit AND is significantly better relative value than the other names people are piling into. It has what the finance community call “asymmetric upside” (more upside potential than downside risk), for the reasons I’ll describe below.

**So what’s the target?** ***Hostess Brands (NASDAQ: TWNK)***. You probably know them as the company that makes Twinkies, but they also make Cupcakes, DingDongs, HoHos, Donettes and Zingers (can’t make this up)…

For some historical context, the company was private-equity owned for awhile and then went public in 2016. The previous owners have fully sold out now, so the entire shares outstanding are pretty much public float today and there’s no more downward pressure on the stock price from their share sales.

The company also has warrants from the their IPO (effectively long-dated call options) that trade under TWNKW. They trade as half warrants, so need two warrants to form one share and are ITM at $11.50 per one full share and expire in November 2021.

**So what’s the thesis?** We think there’s an opportunity to wring out the short sellers in this name and potentially even further upside from a gamma squeeze if we can get enough call option volume. From a fundamental standpoint, the business is extremely stable (as it was a pretty ideal candidate for an LBO), and trades at a slight discount to its peers.

# Technical Thesis

1. **High short interest = squeeze opportunity** – Roughly 15% short interest today, higher than AMC which is last reported at 10-15% (see end of post for reference) and BB at 5-10%. This seems low in comparison to GME, but again this company has no structural problems that we’re aware of (can’t really say the same for movie theaters or mall-based retailers right now) and has actually been performing pretty well. Also, anything above 20% short interest is considered pretty high in the normal world. This level of short interest on a solid business smells like opportunity to squeeze out a couple of greedy hedge funds.
2. **Limited liquidity and trading volume will make it difficult for shorts to cover** – Average 3-month daily trading volume of 1.4mm shares (roughly 1% of the float). It would take about *13+ DAYS* for the shorts to fully cover if they were to buy up all the average daily trading volume. Current $2bn market cap is also in the perfect sweet spot for the retail pool of capital. If you’re looking for a bit of diversification, this is the name.
3. **The potential for a Gamma squeeze is all further upside** – There’s actually been option activity picking up on this company. ***On Friday, Nasdaq reported that call options for 2.6mm of underlying shares traded hands on TWNK. This is with limited mention of TWNK online thus far (based on my keyword search through reddit)****.* See [this report](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-friday-option-activity%3A-twnk-wdc-nvcr-2021-01-29). Most of those options were sold OTM at the $17.50 strike price. Things are moving quick here and we might not be the only ones that have sniffed out this opportunity. In order to create the biggest upside, buying the highest strike call option is ideal. As the price moves closer to ITM on those options, the market makers will have to buy more shares to hedge. The IV is still really low on this name.

# Fundamental Thesis

1. **Snacking continues to be king.** Large market, resilient, growing. 95% of U.S. adults snack daily, and the average American snacks 3x-5x per day. The snacking category generates \~$150bn in annual sales and is expected to continue growing mid-single-digits driven by the need for convenience as consumers (at least pre-COVID-19) are busier than ever. Lots of room for multiple winners in the industry, of which I think Hostess will continue to be one.
2. **Strong organic growth story**. Organic sales have grown \~6% per year on average over the last number of years. Hostess Brands is growing – and likely gaining share.
3. **Strong brand value and nostalgia factor with millennials.** Some of you might be old enough to remember this but during 2012, when the company filed for bankruptcy (due to the heavy debt burden from its buyout), consumers freaked out that the company would discontinue production of their beloved Twinkies, triggering a mad scramble to buy up all available supply of Twinkies. ***At the peak Twinkies sold on Ebay for $22,000 (see article*** [***here***](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/on-ebay-the-starting-bid-for-a-single-twinkie-is-now-5-000/265346/)***).***
4. **The acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 rides the healthy snack trend.** Voortman sells crème wafers and sugar free cookies (new product categories for Hostess), and markets as having no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup, and no trans-fat (playing the “better-for-you” snack trend). Voortman is one of the fastest growing independent sweet snacking brands of scale in North America, and should be able to accelerate growth by leveraging Hostess’ existing distribution footprint.
5. **COVID-19 re-opening should drive a bounce-back in convenience store traffic, which is the company’s primary sales channel and may also increase demand as consumers become busy again (and thus snack more).** Management plans to keep growing within the convenience store channel, which is a growing end-market and should rebound as the world re-opens. As consumers get back to their busy pre-COVID-19 lives, they may also go back to snacking more out of convenience.

# Potential Risks

1. **Changing consumer preferences, especially to healthy.** The recent acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 allows Hostess to further capitalize on the healthy trend.
2. **Pretty high leverage for a public company.** They have roughly $950mm of net debt, or \~4x leverage on Adj. EBITDA (Adj. EBITDA is a proxy for cash flow). This is pretty high leverage for a public company (but quite low in private equity land). Leverage increased to \~4.5x in the beginning of 2020 after the acquisition of Voortman Cookies (up from \~3.4x before the acquisition), but has steadily declined to \~4x today as Adj. EBITDA has grown. Given their cash flow profile, would not be surprised to see them continue to deleverage.
3. **Customer concentration.** The Company’s largest customer is Walmart, which was \~24% of sales. Top ten customers accounted for \~62% of sales in 2019. Some risk with customer concentration, but Hostess Brands is such a well-known and entrenched brand that I don’t think retail stores will do anything irrational.
4. **Rebound of COVID-19.** Risk that COVID-19 cases rise again, possibly hurting traffic and sales through retail stores, increasing costs, or causing supply chain disruptions. On the flip side, the snack category seems to have held steady from consumers staying at home and snacking more.

# Conclusion

If you’re looking for a little diversification or finding the next oversold stock, look no further. This stacks up as a much better opportunity than AMC or BB given the higher short interest and more stable business fundamentals. Also, we can also potentially create even more upside with a gamma squeeze if we are able to buy more call options at the high strike prices.

***Again, this is not intended to distract from other holdings you may have. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade (and hopefully does not require much capital). Bringing this to your attention now before it starts to trade away from us or before the hedge funds exit their shorts. More than happy to hear any feedback from you guys.***"|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082633.csv|DueDiligence|['TWNK', 'I']|[]|['I', 'TWNK', 'IV', 'DR', 'AMC', 'AND', 'LDING', 'THE', 'LINE', 'ON', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'AND', 'IPO', 'TWNKW', 'ITM', 'AMC', 'BB', 'GME', 'TWNK', 'TWNK', 'OTM', 'ITM', 'IV', 'U', 'S', 'I', 'BITDA', 'BITDA', 'BITDA', 'I', 'TWNK', 'TWNK', 'TWNK', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'I', 'AMC', 'BB']|['AMC', 'GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC']

50m minus ""9m from Ryan RC Ventures"" minus ""15-20m from this reddit group"" = 21m-26m

Lets say SI is 28m on Sunday. Add SI from today and you will get 31m of SI.

Now SI to realistic float ratio = 125-150% - VERY VERY HIGH!!!

KEY IS TO HOLDDDDDDDDD !!! DIAMOND HANDS!!!!

What everyone misses is that ENTIRE FLOAT IS NOT UP FOR GRAB, which is different from other stocks. You have RC Venture with 9m shares and out of 8 million diehards of Reddit wallstreetbets/gme groups, it’s easy to assume we have 15-20m shares among us in diamond hands! So realistic float of 21-26m is much more important than the textbook float of 50m. So that makes 31m of SI very high stacked against worst case realistic float of 26m!! Even if few people drop out (too bad they will miss huge gains potentials) then we are looking at 100% ratio at a minimum. Now imagine Ryan Cohen announces major news for GameStop like raising stake or huge tie up and stock jumps organically? Shorts are scared of that surprise. Porsche did exactly that with Volkswagen. Once short ladder attacks are over, low hanging fruits are grabbed up from paper hands and interest starts pounding on these HFs, the stock will jump exponentially!! 

Must read:
Feb01 COB article from a reputed writer on SeekingAlpha:

“The GME momentum higher will probably continue for some more days, even weeks. Some of the short-selling hedge funds will disappear - bankrupted or bought out (likely pennies on the dollar). When that happens, the GME rally/momentum will stop”

Lakeland Industries. 10-15% short interest & constantly abused by wannabe hedge funds. 

It's a small cap manufacturer of protective equipment and accessories for the industrial and public protective clothing market worldwide. The company has a robust balance sheet, and current trades at a \~4x expected fiscal year ended 2021 EBITDA on a fully diluted basis (which is a complete joke).  The valuation is dumb for two reasons: 1) a general misunderstanding by the market that this is purely a COVID-19 play; 2) the company has traditionally been known as sleepy and a poor allocator of capital, which, contrary to its valuation, is no longer the case. 

Driven by a new management team and a newly implemented ERP system, the company’s recent financial performance has been outstanding since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Q3 revenues for the fiscal year 2021 came in at $41.5M, representing growth of 18% from Q3, and 50% from the prior year’s Q3 of fiscal 2020. Increased demand for its products, and significant improvements in gross margins, Lakeland has enabled Lakeland to generate cash from operations of $34.5 million over the last twelve months. As a result of this success, the company’s balance sheet now features a total cash balance of $40.2 million, and no debt. Lakeland is one of the few producers of protective equipment to own its manufacturing facilities, which has enabled it to service customers globally far quicker than its larger competitors, who rely on contractors. An effective supply chain is an important differentiator in today’s environment. 

The capital structure is clean. Lakeland only has one class of shares, the total share count is fairly low, and directors and shareholders own roughly 2.9% of the company. Stock options outstanding also are very low (only about 24,900 as at October 31, 2020). The company does repurchase shares from time to time, but has not done so during the current fiscal year. 

Judging by the low trading multiples, the market has clearly branded this exclusively as a COVID-19 PPE stock. This appears to be far from the truth. Lakeland estimates that approximately 35% of its revenue is driven by COVID-19 PPE requirements, and the remainder of its revenue is related to product segments not related to the pandemic. Lakeland is therefore uniquely positioned to benefit not only from the newly emerging industrial cleaning industry, but also from the economic recovery. Management has been mindful to not pivot its core business entirely from protective equipment for various industries (O&G, fire safety, chemical) to servicing COVID-19 demand, so that it can continue to excel as the pandemic subsides. 

The big question for investors right now is what will Lakeland do with its glut of cash? The current management team is demonstrating a strong understanding of its cost structure, driven by its recent implementation of an ERP system.  Low margin SKUs have been culled, which has led to improved gross margins. The facilities in Vietnam and India are being expanded to meet the increased, and sustainable, demand in developing markets. On an annualized basis for the current fiscal year, Lakeland is currently clipping at a ROIC of 30%. Therefore I’m a proponent for reinvestment, and expect management to pursue scaling this business up. Complemented by a renewed societal focus on protective equipment, and buoyed by continuous PP&E stockpiling which is likely to sustain well into 2022, Lakeland is in a prime position to scale up its success and accelerate its already impressive growth trajectory. 

**Catalyst**

· Significant re-rate by the market once Lakeland sustains its impressive results as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. A targeted EV/EBITDA multiple of \~13.0x is implied by comparable companies. That implies a TARGET PRICE OF $57, which will be easy to achieve and is backed by results.

I suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions

TLDR; **Melvin and gang hasn't covered shit. They've been illegally ""closing out"" their short positions and if we hold they will 100% get fucked. There is far more nefarious shit at play.**

So this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME. This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above ~120% short interest still. I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close >50% of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week. This got me digging around to figure out what's up.

I started by looking into GME failed to delivers (i.e. short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock) for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan, GME had ~1.2 MILLION failed to delivers. This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying.

What was interesting though, is that of that ~1.2million, ~700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period. I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months. It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road.

Having spent some time looking at the pattern, it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in, then a small chunk of coverage, then another large amount, and so on. To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article: https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf

In it, a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME:

""Assuming that XYZ (e.g. GME) is a hard to borrow security (e.g. apes holding strong), and that Trader A (Melvin), or its broker-dealer, is unable (apes again) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer’s close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as “reset transactions,” in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm’s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.""

It's almost like a play by play of what we've seen (in combination with the ladder attacks). My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th.

I 100% think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud. In fact, I would bet all my money on it - oh wait, I did 96 GME @ 290.

I am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail.

Not a financial adviser, I eat paint chips for dinner


One paragraph for the lazy or idiotic from the link: (credit to u/bcRIPster)

“I don’t mean the bet WSB played… that Marvin had 140% of the FLOAT. I mean that Vanguard, Fidelity and BlackRock have sold more than the TOTAL SHARES that EXIST.

That's a completely different problem and it's punishable by jail time. Not a joke. It's basically counterfeiting stock shares, although that's not the terminology used. If this is true, who knows how many other times they’ve done this. Or maybe it's not true, and they just really like the stock??? If BlackRock started buying five days ago, and the longest they can likely do this is 21 days, then the doomsday clock doesn’t run out until at least February 17th. If Wall Street can get WSB to sell before then, then they won’t get caught and won’t go to jail. But if they don’t…. well, this will make Enron look like chump change.

If enough people hold until the end of February, and this is truly the situation, then there is a chance that major parts of Wall Street are going to IMPLODE.

---------- The Conclusion ----------

Apes need diamond hands until the end of February in order to get the SEC involved, most likely somewhere between Feb 17th - 19th. Whether or not this will happen is anybody's guess, but if it does all heck may break loose!”



My opinion? This, along with the fact that a shit ton of calls expiring March 19th that we’re just bought (see the front page of WSB) means that this may not end for a few weeks, maybe even longer. The only way hedge funds will lose is if the shares are HELD.

Are we going to do this???? Or are we going to paper hand out? If we’re commuting to this shit let’s do it!!!! If you’re gonna paper hand eventually we don’t want you, get out. It just makes it worse the later you paper hand. Someone else who will diamond hand those shares should have the chance to buy them and appreciate them for what they are.

TLDR:
If these guys are right about there theory about what is going down behind the scenes, you may have to hold up until end of February or even longer. But this shit is happening. ALSO dont watch the ticker every day or you will get burnt out. This is REALLY important. Take a walk, workout, read, watch TV, spend some time with family; take some breaks from staring at the ticker. It may not do much other than be manipulated lower, rise slightly, and be stable in the near term. But this will squeeze the day that shorts are legally forced to cover due to the shit they pulled

Ok, so I can barely read as much as the next shit throwing monkey that roams these autistic lands and with that being said I was able to do a significant amount of DD in the form of reading every single WSB post in the past few weeks since this GME stuff really started to take off. So I am basically the smartest helmet. 

MY QUESTION : If over 100% of the GME shares where shorted by the Hedge Funds, and shorted shares being that they are borrowed and never actually paid for (yet) and then we have a bunch of retail investors that flood the market and pay cash for the GME shares so that we own the shares. This being the case, does that mean that every single retail investor has the opportunity to tell the Hedge Fund what price to pay for their share at? I mean if the Hedge Funds told the SEC that they own over 100% of the GME shares when retail investors actually own their shares. Then why are we not all of us setting our sell limit to 100k and no less. Forcing the Hedge Funds to pay that share price for every single GME share for every single investor that is selling.  

Like if I go on my account right now and set my sell limit to 100k right now, will the hedge fund eventually be absolutely 100% forced to pay that price no matter what? Like, they NEED my shares. The people who bought .5 shares of GME they don't just WANT  your half a share, they are in desperate NEED for that .5 share because they lied when they told the SEC how many shares they have so you could sell that half a share for 50k if you wanted to.

I know people have been saying that retail investors have the power right now. And is this how? Because we can set the price. Like an actual fixed price that they 100% have to pay no matter what.

AMC is a solid sell at these prices, and I'll cover just some of the reasons.

\- Hedgies dumped millions of NEW shares onto market last week, in exchange for the debt of AMC they held:

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake/silver-lake-cashes-out-on-amc-for-713-million-after-reddit-fueled-rally-idUSKBN29Z00E](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-silver-lake/silver-lake-cashes-out-on-amc-for-713-million-after-reddit-fueled-rally-idUSKBN29Z00E)

And they are thinking of dumping even more NEW shares, CRUSHING any hopes of a short squeeze, just last week **more than 44m shares were sold by Silver Lake, this is the same amount as THE ENTIRE NUMBER OF SHARES SOLD SHORT according to Ortex data as of 15th of Jan ( the most recent release) :**

[https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-considers-selling-more-stock-134513894.html](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-considers-selling-more-stock-134513894.html)

&#x200B;

And **shareholders have been diluted in their positions by around 75%!** :

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amc-entertainment-stock-now-a-sell-at-mkm-as-price-target-drops-to-1-11612196602](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amc-entertainment-stock-now-a-sell-at-mkm-as-price-target-drops-to-1-11612196602)

And more than **100m shares have/will/are in the process of being issued**, they a issuing shares like the FED are printing money:

[https://www.thestreet.com/investing/amc-entertainment-capital-raise](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/amc-entertainment-capital-raise)

&#x200B;

**And most of this occurred AFTER the short interest report for Jan 15, which only showed a ABSOLUTELY pitiful 15.92% Short Interest, and only 1.21 days to cover, and cost to borrow being incredibly low - see the Ortex panel. I'd post a pic here from my account but I can't upload it at the moment. This was never high enough for a squeeze, now with all these new shares on the market or about to hit it you HONESTLY STILL THINK THERE WILL BE A SQUEEZE? STILL?** 

**SILVER has about the same chance now of squeezing as AMC!**

\----------

This is getting beyond a joke. The current price was clearly a result of baseless hype and people assuming it is still going to short squeeze. This is clearly all but a lie at this point. The company will trend back to it's fundamental value of around 2$ -$3 ( the broker consensus on IB) very quickly, as soon as people realize it's not going to squeeze anymore. This was what the price targets were when the company was talking about the real possibility of bankruptcy only about two weeks ago ( see SEC filings ). They won't go bankrupt now, at least in the near term, because they issued a shit ton of shares during the short mania, but this still leaves around 5.1 Billion in debt, and a company losing more than 100 million a month thanks to Covid.

If you are looking for a afterparty to join after GME, AMC definitely isn't it.

\---------

**TLDR:**

**Don't suck others into this failing short squeeze just because got sucked in by the hypetrain and want to sell the stock you bought at 17-20$ to some other poor bastard who knows even less than you do about short squeezes.**

Poistions:

Put spreads, such as  OTM bearish butterflys, verticals, and diagonals. Basically however I can get some negative deltas on this thing without paying to much in IV.

It made me realize that what these dudes have done was to force the clearing houses to hedge against the contracts by BUYING 100 SHARES FOR EACH CONTRACT. I know 800 strike and the timeline is probably expensive. But if the dumbo hedgies try to ""scare"" us off with artificially low prices, we can respond by buying options contracts way out of the money, which inadvertently is probably not way out of the money at all. This could start a gamma squeeze and we can probably generate the catalyst we need to push back against the hedge funds. Buying shares is a grind, and buying 100 of them at $325 is waaaaay more expensive than buying a single call option contract. Maybe we can use this to our advantage."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082633.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['I', 'UYING', 'HARES', 'FOR', 'EACH', 'TRACT', 'I']|[]

QNX is generally regarded among engineers as the most advanced, stable and secure operating system in the world. As such it is trusted by the likes of NASA for mission critical operations, large nuclear power stations, factories, high-speed train control systems, and an endless array of embedded systems that require 0% downtime. QNX has earned its reputation and many in the computer industry believe that if QNX had chosen to compete with Microsoft and Apple and pursue a consumer sales route rather than an enterprise route, the world of computing would be generations ahead of where it is now. 

So what makes it so great? QNX is built on a micro-kernel, which means that the core component of the OS (the kernel) only contains the bare minimum amount of code that can provide the mechanisms required to run an operating system. The remaining functions in a typical kernel (Monolithic OS) such as the filesystem, device drivers, application IPC, etc. are instead run outside of the kernel in the user space. Essentially what this means is that the kernel is the only software executing at the most privileged hardware level and is therefore infinitely more secure and stable. Bad drivers, software or executions can’t bring it down.

Micro-kernels also allow for RTOS, which simply means an operating system with guaranteed consistency for how long it takes to accept and complete a task. For a real-life scenario, think about the ABS brakes on a car – they require mission critical specifications to occur in real-time or someone can die, so the system running them has to be able to guarantee the delivery, receipt and execution of messages in X amount of time or it does not qualify at RT.

The benefits of this architecture are too numerous to get into here, but one of the main benefit to RIM is its ability to execute multiple platform runtimes at the same time with high efficiency – this is why you can write an application in C/C++, Adobe AIR, Webworks HTML5, and Java and have them all run natively on BlackBerry 10. The benefit to developers and consumers here cannot be understated. Basically ANYONE with any amount of programming experience can make an app, from high-level web based UI’s to low-level 3D games.

QNX takes their design one step further by also offering POSIX support, which is a family of IEEE standards that helps maintain OS and software compatibility. Being a full POSIX system, and not partly POSIX, ensures it’s a lot easier to develop software for the QNX platform."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|['BB', 'QNX']|[]|['QNX', 'NASA', 'QNX', 'QNX', 'QNX', 'OS', 'IPC', 'RTOS', 'ABS', 'X', 'RT', 'RIM', 'AIR', 'NYONE', 'D', 'QNX', 'POSIX', 'IEEE', 'OS', 'POSIX', 'POSIX', 'QNX']|['RT', 'AIR']

They are doing everything they can to manipulate and induce panic selling, so they can buy in to cover shorts as low as possible. THE FRENZY OF BUYING THAT IS COVERING SHORTS STILL HAS NOT HAPPENED. Hold strong and buy the dip. They are trying to ride out this movement and squash it with disinformation. Also, this is not financial advice, I am dumber than a second coat of paint. I just really like the stock.

Was mostly trying to point out the large dip JUST before massive squeeze. Apologies because I realize the chart I pasted kind of sucks, but google it for yourself because fuck you. Hopefully you realize that short positions eventually have to buy back the shares they borrowed. That is the real squeeze. I know that VW and GME are not the same situation, because I recognize GME is much more volatile and much more potential to squeeze higher. Lower float, higher short interest, legion of millions of retards, etc.

1. They don’t give a fuck about the small guy and their losses. Loss porn is literally a thing and that only proves that they aren’t protecting us, but their own positions. The only reason to protect yourself is if you are about to get hurt.

If someone is a about to punch you in the face but they are 2 blocks away you don’t do shit. If they are within striking distance you do everything you can to protect yourself.

2. The reputational costs of doing this are astronomical, take RH for example who possibly fucked their IPO. The cost/benefit of this means that these costs of removing shares is lower than the cost of doing nothing and getting smashed by us.

3. I could only think of two reasons before my autism kicked in and I started licking a pole. 

Not financial advice. Position .18 of a share. Poor AF.

With recent revelations of possible (if not likely) share counterfeiting, continued aggressive short ladder attacks, and increasing media distractions/disinfo, I have a theory I want WSB's input on.

# Short sellers are not just cheating at the game, they're scaring the referees into submission.

What we know:

1. Volume was incredibly low today, thanks to restrictions on platforms popular with retail investors (and good monkes holding).
2. Despite low volume, we saw ridiculous price drops as firms traded cash to ladder the price down.
3. Even with conservative/favorable estimates on short interest, HFs/MMs/Brokerages are still extremely exposed because...
4. There is a massive synthetic shares problem with no real way out, except continuously kicking the can down the road. As beautifully put by /u/forzan, [""their cure is a poison they can't stop taking.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lanf94/gme_is_a_time_bomb_and_its_highlighting_a_severe/)

**This all points to textbook** [**Brinkmanship**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brinkmanship)**, or a form of** [**Madman Theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madman_theory)**.**

GME shorts have taken the financial system hostage, strapped it into the back seat, and are driving full-speed-ahead at retail investors in a massive game of chicken.  From what we've seen, hedgies are willfully doubling down on a terrible bet, to the point that it threatens to crash the market.

They know they lost the match, so their only option is to work the referees. My guess is that they're trying to fill the powder keg even more, and make the potential fallout so destructive, the SEC has no choice to step in and halt trading. Whatever fines or punishments are levied can't possibly be as bad as the alternative, which is an extinction event for multiple firms (HFs and brokerages).

# So how can the little  🐒 respond?

***You've got to convince them you're more irrational than they are.*** This shouldn't be difficult for this group of shit-throwing apes.

From the Wikipedia article on brinkmanship:

>*For brinkmanship to be effective, the sides continuously escalate their threats and actions. However, a threat is ineffective unless credible—at some point, an aggressive party may have to prove its commitment to action.*

The hedge funds have already begun demonstrating the ""credibility"" of their threat as early as Wednesday last week. They're trying very hard to give the appearance that they are prepared to nuke everything if the refs don't cancel the match.

To win, retail investors have to show they're completely prepared to hold to $0.

You might think that you would never FOMO into a stock or you might be wondering if this applies to you. Ask yourself these questions to find out if you need the checklist. 

- Have you ever thought of buying some super hyped shares at ATH?

- Have you thought about joining ‘the team’ in the squeeze on stockthatshallnotbenamed? (Ps. there are no teams in retail investing it’s every man for himself)

- Do you use WallStreetBets? 

If you answered yes to any of the precursor questions below then you are in danger of a FOMO trade and need this checklist. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HOW NOT TO FOMO CHECKLIST 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Ask yourself why you want to buy the stock. Are you jealous of others gains? Do you want to be part of that weeks big thing? If yes to either then do not buy. Jealous trading is bad trading. 

2. Warren Buffet said “be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.” Ask yourself if people are being greedy with the stock you want to buy, do not buy if they are. 

3. Ask yourself “am I being a sheep?” Sheep do not make money on the stock market, they don’t even understand the stock market, they are sheep. Don’t be a sheep. 

4. Where did you see the stock? If it was on the news don’t buy it. If it’s trending on one of the subreddits then it’s probably too late. 

5. Is it often appearing on the subreddit and being regularly pushed by the same small crowd? Watch out cause without proof they are probably bag holders hoping to pass the bag to you. 

6. Can you explain to somebody what the company does and why it is a good idea to buy it? If not then you shouldn’t buy it yourself. 

7. Is the market mostly red or mostly green that week? Sell on green weeks and buy on red weeks. It might feel like the other way around at the time but that’s emotional trading. 
8. Is it a meme stock? If yes then be an early adopter or don’t adopt at all. 

9. Have you got spare capital? If money is no issue to you or if you are making a small punt that won’t harm your finances then go ahead. If you are making a big, late move into a meme stock then you’ll be seeing red. 

10. Does it have emojis in the DD’s? If yes then disregard all previous steps and bet your house on it."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|['A', 'FOMO']|[]|['FOMO', 'ATH', 'FOMO', 'HOW', 'NOT', 'TO', 'FOMO', 'KLIST', 'I']|[]

Finally, the little guy has gained awareness and has a chance to expose and potentially beat them at their own game. As a full time retail trader focusing in the metal markets I am familiar with the “supply issues” and the suppression of price of silver. The idea that if the demand for physical silver rose and caused a scarcity and therefore a forced demand of deliverables could in turn seriously crush the larger institutions that are net short is not new to me. I have been giving a lot of thought to the idea that many degens in this and other forums have expressed in attempting to squeeze the gay bears through heavy call flow on SLV and AG. I was incredulous to begin with as we all know how easily the hedgies can change the game on us smaller fish.

In a Eureka moment it dawned on me that instead of trying to take down the entirety of the Silver Shorters, there could be more of an affect if you concentrated on one specific area. This is where SLV comes into play......stay tuned to the end as the plot thickens with even more manipulation at foot.

By now we have all heard of call buying gamma effects. Well, in SLV we have many key components that could cause the same effect that we saw in GME. The list is as follows:

* $25 dominant options strike
* The 25 strike relates to an area where major hedging by dealers needs to take place in order for them to  
stay solvent in their SLV positions.
* Hedge wall, where dealers are likely to change the way that they hedge, is currently sitting at $25
* The key gamma strike, where most of the open interest that is related to gamma, is tied to $25
* This indicates that at the $25 is where most of the dealer hedging needs to kick in.
* The key delta strike, where most of the ITM strikes are, is....you guessed it $25
* On top of these greeks, the top PUT OI and top CALL OI are at, yet again $25

We want to see the key gamma strike or hedge wall shift up high as this implies that dealers are buying at higher prices. Dealers are carrying a negative net gamma which means that they will get hurt as price moves up which causes them to buy more shares to keep up with their hedges. We currently have a much higher call volume than put volume as the 8/19/2021 EXP is 4.1 mil calls to 770k puts.

  
If SLV breaks under $25 you will see dealers begin to unwind there positions causing in influx of VOL. Moving forward (above $25) VOL is relatively low. This is due to the volume being distributed over a wide range of strikes. If there were to be a concentration of call buying at the $25 this will in turn increase the VOL above the $25 level.

  
If you want to see a Squeeze type move, we need to see an addition of call options at strikes >25 which would shift the momentum higher.

  
Here is where the plot thickens: As I was writing this I went to look at the AUG chain for SLV and noticed that it has disappeared across all platforms that I use. DO YOU THINK THAT THEY ARE FINALLY SCARED!!! Time will tell. The same effect could be accomplished by going one month out to the SEPT contracts or by buying shorter dated contracts and continuing to roll them until the dealers have drowned in that one position.

As with every disclaimer. This is not financial advice, and I wrote this as a research paper. Trade at your own risk and do your own research. Have fun and enjoy those tendies. 

My position: nothing currently, watching 25 carefully as I said."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082633.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'SLV', 'AG', 'I', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'GME', 'SLV', 'ITM', 'PUT', 'OI', 'CALL', 'OI', 'EXP', 'SLV', 'VOL', 'VOL', 'VOL', 'I', 'I', 'AUG', 'SLV', 'I', 'DO', 'YOU', 'THINK', 'THAT', 'THEY', 'ARE', 'NALLY', 'CARED', 'SEPT', 'I', 'I']|['GME']

I am just sharing what I have read all day today instead of working my day job. Please do your own research to confirm what I am going to say below.

Hey traders,

As Palantir's earnings is coming around the corner (estimated 2/11), their lock-up expiration will also come along at third trading session day after the ER, so estimated to be 2/14. And people who have been watching PLTR should be aware that the lock-up exp may be a huge negative catalyst as several ANALysts have been talking shit on the stock for potential unloading of 80% shares, crashing the stock price.

As a techie who has deep conviction in the company and its tech (browse the sub for plenty of DDs on company's outlook), I was confused when I saw [webull's information on the stock's free float at 1.2b vs. shares outstading at 1.7b](https://imgur.com/a/o5YePOB). Does this mean the lock-up expiration will free up only >400m shares (if yes, BULLISH)? It got confusing so I decided to look into the s-1 filing specifically for the shares structure and forth.

**NOTE**: This is my first time diving deep into a stock like this so **PLEASE** correct me if any part of this incorrect or too biased. I have tried my best to not skip any unclear terminology I faced along the way but in the end, I am not an analyst so I have limited knowledge.

&#x200B;

As of **September 1st, 2020**, this was the total number of shares:

Ignoring/Including small figure RSUs, growth units, and exercisable options:

On first trading day back in September:

* 383,609,647 fully-diluted shares (including stock options) was available to trade
* Registered additional 257,135,415 shares to be available to trade
* Due to Investors’ Rights Agreement, they ""expected"" up to 656,018,583 shares registered additionally to be available to trade
* Total: Up to 1,296,763,645 fully-diluted shares (which seems accurate according to 1.2b free float)

On lock-up expiration day (estimated 2/14):

* 1,863,150,291 fully-diluted shares will be available to trade
   * From what I understand, registering shares allow them to be available to trade so we subtract 257,135,415 and 656,018,583 shares
   * Adjusted: 949,996,293 fully-diluted shares
* Result: Total of 2,246,759,938 fully-diluted shares.
   * The figure above shows 2,173,481,929 fully-diluted shares. The math lines up considering additional RSUs, options could have been issued since September.
* So the lock-up expiration doesn't free up **80%** of outstanding, but instead **42%**.

* TOTAL: **50,318,461** shares

Source: [nasdaq insider activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/pltr/insider-activity)

None of the large shareholders/VCs/institutions sold! Also notice how bitch Soros is not even in the list! 🤣

The insider selling can be said to be pretty high in normal circumstances. But this can be explained in that since PLTR was a direct listing, they had to offload some shares, as well as register a lot of shares, so that the stock had liquidity (something Robinhood doesn't have 🤡). Also, not to mention the company has been around since 2003 so this may have been the first time for the big time insiders to cash out. (Note that these arguments can be seen as biased so take it with a grain of salt).

&#x200B;

# What will happen on lockup expiration day?

I think the following will happen:

* 🧻👐 will sell
* Some short sellers will come by for sure
* Insiders will obviously sell some. But it's not going to be anywhere near the impact that 🐻s are fearing.

**Some key rumors:**

* Some insiders are looking to buy up shares - [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kym23z/pltr_folks_listen_in_karp_and_cohen_to_make_188m/)
* Insiders already had chances to liquidate over the years - [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l49dut/pltr_vs_child_rapists_starvation_hurricanes/) (a good DD overall as well from ex-Palantir engineer)

I am personally planning to buy the dip if there is a big one, but I doubt the red will last long and the stock will go up onwards. I will be putting aside cash to buy the dip

**TLDR; I think lock-up expiration won't mean shit to the stock and I am bullish**

So far, many of you have seen and heard about the ladder attacks that have been happening with GME recently. What if I tell you that ""short interest is going down"" is the result of shorts unwinding their previous ladder attacks?

Let me explain:

Today, I saw something very strange on Webull. I saw shares of GME being traded in L2 data for \~$14, \~20$, and around \~$30. I managed to take a screenshot from one of these sales and in order to make sure that something is very wrong, I made a limit buy order at $30 before it happened again. The order obviously didn't get filled:

&#x200B;

[L2 Time & Sales Data \/ removed my other limit orders](https://preview.redd.it/lmjh2m5bn0f61.png?width=2732&format=png&auto=webp&s=5745279c389cb4101b55f1b9771f776263a2138b)

At first, I thought this might be a glitch, but after thinking about it more, it clicked! I've been following GME for months, the key is within why these prices were chosen ($14, $20, $30)! Folks who've been following GME closely know that GME broke $14 for the first time after the Microsoft deal. Both $20 and $30 were also important breakthroughs for GME's price.

So why are we seeing these prices again today? I have a theory! Short sellers were having ladder attacks back then, but the way they probably did them was the following:

Let's say hedgefund A and hedgefund B are colluding to bring the price down. Since there are no shares available to borrow, A buys 1000 shares and lends them to B. B then shorts those shares but makes sure that A is the one buying them. A lends these shares to B again and B shorts them again. This continues until the price gets down to the desired level. This artificially increases the short interest of GME, but in reality, only 1000 shares have been changing hands. If you look carefully, you see these shares that are being traded in the above screenshot have slightly different prices.

Here is the thing: these short-sellers are probably unwinding the previous ladder attacks now to reduce the artificial short interest they have previously created! The fact that there are not many shares to borrow even though short interest ""in theory"" seems to be going down also proves this! I'm baffled by how dumb these short sellers are to actually use the prices that they used to create those ladder attacks! They are not even trying to hide their tracks at this point!

Now you might ask ""what if all of the short interest is artificial?"", the answer is an obvious no! Why do you ask? because if they didn't have massive short positions, they wouldn't have to do these ladder attacks, to begin with!

How do I know (or rather guess) that the actual short interest hasn't gone down by a lot? 2 reasons:

1. The stock is still hard to borrow in almost all brokerages (AFAIK)
2. The following screenshot shows that there are only %15.9 of all the outstanding shares have been bought at a higher price than today's closing price, which would be around  11.09m shares:

[Position Cost Distribution](https://preview.redd.it/n0okmsbug0f61.jpg?width=1493&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c8638cfede5177ba9e87107aa1f93dd8e20494c)

As you know, today's closing price was a lower price than the price of almost all trades that happened today and Friday, which means one thing: There are AT MOST 11.09m shares left in the float and all that is happening is that they are just changing hands! So the short interest AT MOST has gone down by (0.159\*69.75m=) 11.09m in the past two days (unless the folks who have lent these shares out have sold them immediately after they received them, which seems unlikely to me since I haven't seen any SEC filings from institutions)!

What I do not know is this: do these short-sellers report these artificial short interests in their official report of ""short selling"" or not! My guess is that they don't, because:

1. They are probably scared of getting caught!

2. Another reason why I think these artificial short sales are not included in the official short interest numbers is that short interest estimates for GME has always been off and this can explain why this has been the case (when they are using these type of ladder attack, the estimates are probably higher than reality, and when they are unwinding them the estimates are probably lower).

3. I think it is also very likely that they are unwinding these positions now to cover their tracks!

Also, note that shorts don't have to ""borrow and sell"" to each other to create a ladder, they can just ""buy and sell"" from each other. However, I think they've done this to intentionally mess with the short interest estimates!

Based on this evidence, I believe that the squeeze has not squoze! This also suggests that short-sellers have been committing crimes for a while now in my opinion since this type of collusion is obviously illegal!

Click last 100 trades and set time back to the beginning of the day.
Look at every transaction for exactly 100 a fraction of a second apart, at lower and lower prices.
This happened all day

I also learned spikes in ladder attacks seem to be happening daily, around 10-1130am est.. Which is exactly when the UK market begins to close.
This way they can attack the ending of that market while at the same time affecting ours.

The good news is there was no volume to support actual trading or mass selling.


Good job!

Alright everyone listen up,

So after reading a [good GME DD post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I did some 'research' and found [a tweet](https://twitter.com/minigirraffe/status/1356322532270497793?s=19) about using [Finra](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) data to see Daily Short Volume reported.

Long story short I figured out a way to view the data nicely and make a plot and spoiler alter: Daily Short volume today (2/1/21) was **54.46% (Meaning:**  **54% of** [**$GME**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&amp;src=cashtag_click) **sales on 2/1 were shorts. )**

Don't believe me?? well I have a picture: [https://github.com/undefined-vars/PyFinra/blob/main/gme\_short\_interest\_percent.png](https://github.com/undefined-vars/PyFinra/blob/main/gme_short_interest_percent.png)

(You can also double check the [file here](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210201.txt), Find GME and take Short Vol/ Total Vol).

I have no clue what I'm doing, but if I understand [this](http://regsho.finra.org/DailyShortSaleVolumeFileLayout.pdf) I \*think\* this number doesn't track short volume across all exchanges (so it maybe off), but it can be used as an indicator.

&amp;#x200B;

If someone understands what this data means better, feel free to comment and I can update this. Also please for love of god, don't take any of this as financial advice. I am but a humble reddit citzen who likes the stock.

Link to GitHub repo with code to generate the plots:[Github Repo](https://github.com/undefined-vars/PyFinra)

(Also please no pass judgement on the state of my code, I just threw this together really quickly.)

Edit: I think this file has Daily Short Interest, not total. I also don't know what this means in terms of the squeeze.  


Edit 2: I am also not posting this to try and discourage anyone (I myself am still holding \~100 GME).   
Like I said, not all shorts are reported, but I saw comments and [a tweet](https://twitter.com/minigirraffe/status/1356444468728201219?s=20) talking about this data, so I thought it would be useful if folks could view it easily (rather than scrolling through long txt files).

Edit 3: Omg, I meant “Short Volume” not “Short Interest”. These numbers reflect the number of shorts taken out today not the amount of shorts closed. [A better explanation](https://twitter.com/minigirraffe/status/1356461817384566785?s=21) I’ll update the code tomorrow to make that more clear that it is volume not interest."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|['GME']|['GME']|['I', 'GME', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'A']|['GME', 'GME']

To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1) Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.

2) The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.

3) The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY
    
    # Reads data
    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))
    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = value_of_fails
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, val_of_fails in sorted_stocks:
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = val_of_fails / volume
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

Now, I am as much a noob as most of us here, but I decided to go and try to educate myself on what has been going on with GME, to see if there was any chance of the price reversing and going back up. 

I’ve been seeing quite a few folk post about how the trading volume is low, but I never really understood what that means, so a quick Google search lead me to this:  https://finance.zacks.com/volume-mean-trading-stocks-2570.html

It’s making me believe that it’s just the HF’s forcing the price down and that there could still be a price reversal later on. How much later? I have no idea, but I believe that there is potential one coming. 

I also could be completely wrong and am just being an eternal optimist, but until I’m proven otherwise I am going to keep holding!

Today (2/1) didn't go as many expected.

Some expected things to get uglier for obvious reasons. Last week was bad but at the end of it it seemed as an overwhelming success for everyone who is rooting for GME.

Tendies were expected today... didnt happen.

So what did happened? My monkey brain was trying to comprehend the events and occurrences.

One thing that was noted by fellow monkey brain was how chunks of 100 shares have been traded back and forth in rapid succession.  
People soon attributed this to the short sellers running a ladder attack to drive the price down to bring retail investors to sell their shares so shorties can gobble them up and cover.

This tactic had been used last week too so it came to no surprise.

Now apparently news media is reporting that shorts have been covered from a 120 something% down to 39%. How is that even possible when GME ended so strong last week.

Naturally there should follow a huge price spike if that was the case.

My monkey brain keeps thinking back to those chunks of 100 shares traded. I watched it last week and i did today.

Now things seemed to get really heated last Thursday 01/28, some say the squeeze was about to happen that day and that's when the ladder attack hit. Thats when market manipulation was so obvious it was in EVERYONES face. Restricting sales of shares getting the media involved and so on and so forth

In chunks of 100,

One contract of a call or put is for the right but not the obligation to exercise 100 shares.

Ok fine...So... what does that mean.... monkey brain tired no understand big numbers.

Some have noticed that the fail to deliver securities data shows a significant amount of GME stock not being able to cover, however the data is not up to date. We are lagging behind by a little

Going back to the trade restrictions for GME, many platforms have limited the purchase of GME stock

Over the last couple of days i have been reading one broker being mentioned over and over....  
Who is that ? Fidelity it just so happens that fidelity is one of the major stock holders of GME is that coincidence ? There are others but there is no need to go into detail.

After RobbinHood placed the restriction the price action went down but the shorties have been still trading, how? Where are they getting their shares from?

Are there even shares left ? THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION

Its a mess and to make a long story short i believe but do not know for certain that the short ladder attack is actually a form to cover shorties shorts temporarily just like writing checks back and forth to banks.

I am sorry guys i tried my best here... a lot has happened today and the last 7 days.  
To make it clear i am a retard using his limited brain cells which are decaying rapidly every hour to make some sense of this myself. In no form or way should this affect your decision in buying or selling GME stock. I dont know what i am talking about.

I love the different forms of DD we had in the past couple of weeks. Most of them were very technical and I personally found a more and more increasing interest in the people we love to hate. 

I spend the past couple of hours trying to understand what happened in a time where most of us were busy getting to the new level cap of Lich King whilst boomers managed to fuck up the economy. Yes. I’m talking about 2008.

You see, Melvin Capitals story begins under the wings of Steve Cohens S.A.C. Capital. US Attorney Preet Bharara described them as following in 2013: 

*  “culture of corporate corruption”
*  “institutional indifference to unlawful conduct \[that\] resulted in insider trading that was substantial, pervasive, and on a scale without known precedent in the hedge-fund industry.”
*  “a veritable magnet of market cheaters”

If that isn't off to a great start, right? To understand the story I'm about to tell you, here a short summary of how SAC was structured: 

„SAC was structured like a bicycle wheel, with the spokes consisting of about 100 portfolio managers with their own teams of analysts and traders working in competition with the other teams. Camaraderie in SAC’s offices was low. At the center was Cohen, 57, the only connector between the different groups, who would take the best ideas from each and trade on them himself. Aside from losing money, there was nothing Cohen hated more than a portfolio manager who didn’t communicate vigorously and often.“

In 2008 two employees were charged with insider trading. One of them was Mather Martoma who was involved in insider trading with a new Alzheimer drug that first showed positive and then negative results which helped Cohen get out at a perfect time and thus avoided a $275million loss. 

The other was Jon Horvath, he claimed that his asshole boss Steinberg told him get insider information to get better trades or else he would be fired. So he did with DELL and also passed this information to Steinberg. With this insider information he found out DELL was going to have a bad quarter and built up a massive short position only to find out that his even BIGGER ASSHOLE BOSS COHEN was long DELL. And FUCK was he scared of Cohen, the ragey ass went on a rampage whenever he lost money so he mailed Steinberg to tell him about his concerns. Now it get’s interesting. Steinberg told Cohen and Cohen told Steinberg to figure out who the fuck was right. Jon or the person suggesting him this trade – Gabriel fucking Plotkin. You may be asking “Who dis?“ -it's **Melvin Capitals later fucking founder**. After some back and forth Plotkin realized Jon had the better source and confirmed to sell the long position. After its earnings announement DELL dropped 14%. Good job Jon. 

Later that evening, Cohen sent Steinberg a message that read: “Nice job on dell.” Steinberg’s response was, “Thanks… this ole dog can still hunt”.

This happened again. This time Steinberg/Jon being long, Cohen short. Here a chat: 

>AIM:mike72ms \[Steinberg\] dell rpts thrusday  
AIM:cas— \[Cohen\] y …   
AIM:mike72ms **we like it**…weve been good here if u remember  
AIM:cas— call me… it’s a shame-cause I can be helpful to you too but that;s life  
AIM:mike72ms steve I have an analyst that covers this stock… he has industry contacts… im not hiding anything from u

Cohen replied: “I would prefer to talkon phone”.

I decided to leave in the chat because both sound like fucking retards and Cohen like a salty 9 year old. Truely, no different to us

Martoma, the guy with the Alzheimer drug was convicted to a 9 year prison sentence. 

Jon decided to work with prosecutors to try help fuck over Steinberg but in 2015 the case was abandoned. 

In 2011 Plotkin was apparently investigated for trading Weight Watchers based on insider information. An SAC spokesperson denied this claim however by saying „Gabe Plotkin has built a successful career on a commitment to sound fundamental research“

In 2013 SAC pleaded guilty to an insider trading charge, paid an $1.8 billion penalty and changed its name to Point72 Asset Management. Cohen shrunk the companies size and said goodbye to many of his portfolio managers. 

In 2013 the SEC also charged Steve Cohen with a „failing to supervise“ civil charge in regards to Martoma with the goal to give Cohen a lifetime ban from supervising funds that manage outside money. In the end they settled for a two year ban which I guess is almost the same thing. It is rumoured that Plotkin is the mysterious „Portfolio Manager A“ in this charge

In 2014-2015 Cohen took steps to „increase compliance and oversight” at Point72. He hired former F.B.I agents and federal prosecutors. For example Kevin J. O’Connor and Vincent Tortorella. Some saw this as an effort to “gain the confidence of regulators and permit him to again manage money for outside investors.“

In 2014 Gabriel Plotkin, „one of Cohens most successful traders” founded Melvin Capital. Cohen backed him with a small loan of 200 milion dollars.

In a memo sent to more than 800 employees of Point72, Mr. Cohen said that after SAC pleaded guilty, he “vowed that what happened to SAC would never happen to Point72.” The settlement “is not and cannot — be a reason to become complacent,” Mr. Cohen wrote, adding that the firm would become a leader in compliance.

Fact is, the SEC spent almost a decade trying to get dirt on Steve Cohen and failed. Plotkin got a slap on the wrist by being hinted at in the civil charge against Cohen and Steinbergs case was dropped. But hey, the **analyst** who forwarded insider information in 2008 about an alzheimer drug will be freed from prison soon after 9 years in jail. I know insider trading is irrelevant to the current situation however I found the story interesting because it shows by what rules they play and what type of people they are. 

TL;DR: The people behind Melvin and friends are frauds and cheaters. They never played by the rules, never will. SEC knows this but literally can't do anything.

When making trades it is very important to be aware of your emotions. You don't need to become emotionless but moreso conscious of how you react and behave.

Confirmation bias is the tendency to only take on information/opinions that agree with what you believe is (or will be) the case. This emotional bias is highly elevated when the issue is self relevant i.e. if you hold GME and think it will go to the moon, you will read more posts that agree with what you want to be true and toss others to the side, maybe even put them down.

This is bad.

Contrary to popular belief, you can't just manifest a trade or price increase. For example, price goes up and you think it's a good time to sell. You check Reddit and some ape says ""GME will hit 1000 EOD 🚀🚀🚀"" and this makes you hold on a little longer. Pure greed. Other people being allowed to change your opinion on a good trade is poor on your behalf. 

Read what you want to read, trade how you want to trade. Just be aware of how you react and behave with skin in the game.

TL;DR

A decent explanation is here [OTC Markets BLOG](https://blog.otcmarkets.com/2018/11/13/understanding-short-sale-activity/)

Hey guys, first of all, mods please don't remove this.  
Let's get to it.  
I was here for long, without account lurking and just watching what others 🦧did with their money.  
I saw huge losses, I saw wins, but mainly losses.  
This post is not about advice on how to invest or something, but rather to just give you health advice.  
Let's start:

1. Don't go to your stocks app opening it and closing, hoping something happens. The best way to deal with this is to go out and do stuff to keep your mind off. Why should you do this? Is very unhealthy for the brain to continuously check for new stuff.
2. This is also a great tip. While investing is fun and all, you should also look for factors that will show you that you are slowly going into a depression. Look them up, they are easy to spot, and spotting early can help you.
3. Take time off social media, and walk or exercise if you can. While sitting on your pc and phone is also fun, your body needs to work out so it can work properly. You can make a minigame and if $GME stock goes up by 5% you do 5 pushups etc.

These are some tips I have for you folks. If you need more tips just google them. But don't forget TO HOLD AND WHILE HOLDING TO WORK OUT.  
This community brought a smile to my face. That's why I want to help others.

And I think it still can make a rally and break the ATH pretty soon. Here are my reasons to believe that. 

**Technicals**

It has broken the downtrend and is continuously making new higher highs. Next major resistance levels I see are only around 20$, 22$ and 23$

**Fundamentals**

From fundamentals perspective I think they are doing much better than where their stock price stands. I feel they are undervalued due to some crazy events last year after they merged with their competitor and their own CEO left the organisation. 

Since the change of the CEO there has been some uptick movement and probably it can pick up some pace soon. I think this can be another hidden gem.

TL;DR:


- Short interest seemingly falling despite no shares left to borrow (also caused by ticker dropping over 10% in a day which makes it unshortable), probably because it's masked by millions of new synthetic longs created on 28/01


- Synthetic longs likely defensively created by Market Makers who don't pay interest on them for 21 days, to buy time to protect themselves in the event HFs and brokers aren't enough to cover the squeeze;


- Simultaneously, DTCC recognized financial liability in this squeeze could eventually reach clearing houses if the market makers went bankrupt and on the same date increased collateral requirements to purchase GME to 100%;


- MMs can keep this going for a really long time if needed, but that does not mean forever.

Much of what you are told here is wrong.

You can protect yourself to a degree by learning at least the very basics of how markets work. This post will explain to you how prices work on an exchange, and why ""short ladders"" are not even a coherent concept.

**How markets work**

Exchanges have [order books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_book) in which they track interest in a stock. Orders to buy and orders to sell stay in the order book until someone submits an order that matches their price.

The highest price present on buy orders is called the *bid price*.
The lowest price present on sell orders is called the *ask price*.
The difference between the two is called the *spread*.

When you submit an order to the exchange, it trades at the best price it can get. If you're selling, it will sell to the highest bidder even if you said you were willing to sell for zero.

It is possible for companies to trade off-exchange, but when you are looking at the price of a stock on Google or wherever, the price is based on trades that took place on the exchange. For this reason it is common if you're looking at a feed giving you prices in real time to see the price going up and down between two prices for a number of seconds as people sell at bid price and buy at ask price.

**Why short ladders are not possible**

Short ladders are described as two hedge funds selling back and forth to one another at an increasingly lower price.

This makes no sense for the following reasons.

* Off-exchange transactions do not result in ticks. Nobody sees them.
* You cannot target another participant on the exchange to sell to. You have to go through the order book.
* If the order book has $10000 of bids at $100, you cannot drive the price down to $99 except by selling $10000 of stock at $100.

This is a theory made up by someone who has no knowledge of how markets work - if they understood the basics they would at least try to make it believable.

If you google ""short ladder attack"" you will get a bunch of hits on Reddit, [a StackExchange question](https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/135807/closing-shorted-positions-via-short-ladder-attacks) debunking it, and pretty much nothing else of note. If you google ""short attack"" your top two hits are a description from CFO.com of companies releasing a report at the same time they short e.g. alleging financial irregularities, and a piece of frothing madness from SeekingAlpha where some nutter in 2014 makes up a bunch of nonsense involving ""counterfeit shares"".

This is not real."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082633.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['WSB', 'CFO']|['CFO']

From u/Anttte

Before I head to bed I feel the need to leave behind three important pieces of information behind for tomorrow. The first one is this:

https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/interactive-chart

This link provides the information about todays volume. The volume represents the trades that are happening. And today the volume has been really low. This means people are not selling. We have been holding, which should drive the price up.

The second one is this:

https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml

This link provides the information about todays supply/demand considering buy and sell orders (on fidelity). The demand is WAY too high for the supply to meet, which should also drive the price up.

The third is this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8ox3/at_these_levels_its_not_about_the_price_of_the/

Hedge funds are ""fraudulently creating more shares"" and retail are holding. They are using very ugly tactics in order to bring the price down to a number that satisfies them since even $225 is beyond the amount they are prepared to absolutely-have-to-fucking-pay.

Please stay educated. Do not trade emotionally. And lastly get some rest. We do not know when this shitshow will end. But hopefully we will have left a stain of hope in history behind us.

Please feel free to repost this to infinity. It may satisfy alot of people (like myself) who feel extremely anxious after today, and need a pat on the shoulder."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'WAY']|[]

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.

**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question."|2021-02-02 08:26:27.805311|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_082631.csv|DueDiligence|['HOLD']|[]|['DD', 'I', 'GME', 'DD', 'RH', 'I', 'WSB', 'ITM', 'A', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'PT', 'A', 'I', 'TSLA']|['GME', 'RH', 'GME', 'TSLA']

You may feel like you're losing and everything has been for naught, you may even be thinking about selling at all time lows (but you realised this is a very stupid thought) or that everything you put in will be wasted and you'll be in debt.

It's okay. 

We knew this wouldn't be easy, we're fighting an uphill battle against people who used all types of underhanded methods for years; did we expect it to be easy? No. Did we expect it to be over within a week? Absolutely not. Did we expect it to be this hard? Probably no as well.

Take a deep breath and just know time is on our side, what's the worst that can happen? They keep up the short ladder attacks and expect us to sell? As long as we hold they can't cover their shorts. That's a fact. 

Just hold.

Hold till march if you have to.

Fill those lungs of yours with fresh air, put your phone down and go spend time with your family or go play some PC or Xbox or PS or whatever the fuck you do in your spare time.

First this is not a short squeeze or a this is going to make 100x post. However, $PM is a great value play in my opinion. Obviously not financial advice, I am just a retard. Also $PM may be deemed unmoral. This post is not based on morals, only on financials. I am a non smoker, with no intention of using any nicotine product and would urge every reader to not start using nicotine products, due to their addictiveness.

**TLDR:** PM owns the leading cigarette brand marlboro and have worldwide operation, excluding the USA and China. PM introduced iqos (I quit ordinary smoking) a few years ago. It heats the tobacco and does not burn it. It is supposedly as addictive, but less harmful. The iqos revenues already make up 25% of their revenue and the unit sales are growing at roughly 30%. The market is potentially bigger than cigarettes. $PM is underpriced at a PE of 16.

First, a bit of history. The cigarette business had explosive exponential growth starting in the early 1900s. The growth stopped when the public  got aware of the gigantic negative side effects of smoking (lung cancer). However, the revenues continued to grow, not because of unit sales, but because of price increases. It turns out that cigarettes are highly addictive and it is difficult to give up the habit. Still worldwide unit sales peaked in 2011 at 5700 billion sticks a year. In 2019 they were down to 5100 billion. In the US for example the unit sales peaked in 1997 and are down more than half.

To understand the reason why it is so difficult to quit one needs to understand how nicotine is delivered into the body. By breathing in the nicotine it gets absorbed by your lungs in gets directly into the blood stream. This results in a peak of nicotine. This peak is called nicotine hit. It is the main reason why cigarettes are so addictive. It is also likely that marlboro delivered a product that makes more addictive by changing the ph value of the smoke and therefore increasing the adoption (I think this is true, but I am unsure. Mostly I dont want to get sued by pm). So to make a nicotine product more addictive you have got to increase the speed of absorption. To my knowledge vapes are less addictive, because of a smaller nicotine spike.

$PM engineered iqos in a way that it is able to deliver the same nicotine spike as cigarettes do (they even put pictures of the pharmacokinetic in inverstor information). iqos heats the tobacco, but does not burn it. So instead of burning cigarette, they heat so called heet sticks. iqos has less harmful aerosols in its ""smoke"" since the tobacco  gets heated not burnt. There is no definitive answer to whether iqos is less harmful in the long run, but the indications are here that is less harmful in a significant way. This is underlined by the FDA categorization as a modified risk tobacco product. So to my mind there is a product that is as addictive as cigarettes, but less harmful.

iqos was first introduced in the east asia and australia region and it was a blazing success. The first year with major sales was 2016 with 7billion unit sales. It jumped to 33 billion unit sales in 2017 to 30 billion unit sales in 2019. In Japan (the first market in which iqos was introduced) their unit sales of heets amount to 20% of the entire cigarette market (after something like 5 years). This is a crazy amount of market share. PM itself has a worldwide market share of only 28%. There have already been many product iterations of the heater and I am confident that there are more and better products to come. It should be noted that the overall market in japan cigarette market contracted since the introduction of iqos.

Given the success in Japan PM started the roll out in other countries, currently they are increasing their sales in europe aggressively. I live in central europe and am seeing the increase in iqos users on the streets. So to my mind over the next years PM will be able to grow worldwide heet sales by a multitude. Their aspirational targets are to sell more than 250 billion smoke free sticks by 2025, while they sold 60 billion smoke free sticks in 2019. To my mind this target is achievable and may even be conservative. Further, I believe that they will continue their sales further after the year 2025. Btw. skimming through the iqos subreddit suggest that people how switch to iqos smoke more heets than they previously smoked cigarettes.

The cigarette business has incredible high margins. Based on their net revenue (excluding excise taxes) their operating margin is more than 40% and increasing. This increase is partly because of the increase in revenue of iqos. I think that the pricing power may even increase due to iqos. Since iqos needs a heating device a nespresso like system is created with switching costs. 

So how much should be a company like this be worth. Personally I value it at something like 130$ per share. (trades around 80$). However, when pricing it in comparison to something like $PEP I am shocked that $PM trades around a PE of 17, while $PEP trades at 27. 

Summary: To my mind the earnings are going to grow at a rate of something like 5% per year for the foreseeable future. The iqos segment is growing its units sales at around 30% with little cash expenditure. Their market share will probably increase over the next decade. However, the market size is uncertain. To my mind it is completely possible that the market size will grow over the next decades. Pricing a business like this with a $PE of 17 is insane to me in the current environment with $PEP at 27. To my mind it is an incredible save and stable business, that will have many more decades of profitability. Maybe we even enter some kind of nicotine renaissance of smoking (or heeting in this case). Maybe even the percentage of users cigarettes and heets user will go up and we enter a ""golden age"" of nicotine, like the 1910-1940s.

P.S. This is my first wallstreetbets post! I was impressed by some good dd and want to contribute.

(b) (1) A trading center shall establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to:

(i) Prevent the execution or display of a short sale order of a covered security at a price that is less than or equal to the current national best bid if the price of that covered security decreases by 10% or more from the covered security's closing price as determined by the listing market for the covered security as of the end of regular trading hours on the prior day; and

(ii) Impose the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for the remainder of the day and the following day when a national best bid for the covered security is calculated and disseminated on a current and continuing basis by a plan processor pursuant to an effective national market system plan.

(iii) Provided, however, that the policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to permit:

(A) The execution of a displayed short sale order of a covered security by a trading center if, at the time of initial display of the short sale order, the order was at a price above the current national best bid; and

(B) The execution or display of a short sale order of a covered security marked ""short exempt"" without regard to whether the order is at a price that is less than or equal to the current national best bid.

&#x200B;

As most of you, ive spent considerable amounts of time reading up on this very strange occurrance. As I see it, a dip today (or even red numbers this entire week) was to be expected. However, as I did my research, I happened to stumble upon ""[CFR § 242.204 - Close-out requirement](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2018-title17-vol4/pdf/CFR-2018-title17-vol4-sec242-204.pdf)"". I am a swedish law student, so of course this was of huge interest to me, even though I dont know how to refer to it correctly (and also explains why this text is missing some characters). Now, what this text tells me, is that the shorters will **have to** cover their positions sometime this month. [I also read](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) that there is a chance that this is requirement to cover the shorts can be fulfilled by simply using fraudulent shares that do not really exist. However, as lawmakers seem to be looking into what is currently happening, I am not so sure this will be their chosen method, as it means they are basically exposing their fraud for the whole world to see. Of course, another option is for them to see this as perhaps the last time they can save themselves through this loophole before its eventually covered. In my mind, theres a 50/50 chance of either option, however I am certainly hoping for the first alternative.

&#x200B;

Now, for some other thoughts. If the Robinhood-limit is actually set due to liquidity-issues, I believe they would ease up on it at some point during this week, assuming they can manage to locate the liquidity needed for this. IE. - assuming they are not as evil as we might have thought, the demand should rise and the price should go up. If they arent, well I guess we will have to wait and see what happens.

&#x200B;

What however seems pretty clear, at least to me (who doesnt really know what the hell is going on more than what Ive been told and managed to read up on) - something is going on that they dont want the retail investors to know about. Sure, some short positions have been covered (about 37-80% remaining, depending on the source), but how can we know these are legitimately covered, or even have been covered at all, as we dont have the short statistics yet?

&#x200B;

TL:DR - There are laws in place that say the naked shorts have to be covered sometime soon. We dont actually know how many of these are still floating around, or if they even exist anymore (any hedgie with a brain should make sure to try and cover these first), but if there is a substantial amount floating around, we should see a peak when they have to cover. Again, as I am not an american law student, I am uncertain as to how this document should be understood, but this is my understanding.

&#x200B;

Second, if RH is really prohibiting buying because of liquidity-issues, this could probably be resolved during the week, with trading reassumed and demand increasing. If not, well that is clearly beyond my comprehension.

&#x200B;

Third, I dont know where this is going. I am currently holding seven shares bought at 235-289, so you bet I want to see the prices go back to where they were a few days ago. I am also not your financial advisor (obviously), and you should probably not take my word for anything, but the sources i refer to could be a good read.

&#x200B;

I dont actually know if this was even worth reading, but hopefully it could tell you what to look for (and where to find it).

First we know they are usually underestimated (in an order of 10 to 40 times), we know that when the seller does not provide of the stock after T+2 (settlement date) it is then when the transaction is categorised as failed and enters in the ""Failed to delivery"" list.

After T+28 days (or T+30 after the trade date) the share enters the ""Aged failed to deliver"" list if still is not settled.

At this point, the broker was not able to deliver the actual share to the buyer, this results in the broker having to account for the actual share (adjusting its books accordingly).

This could be the reason of why the NSCC asked RH for 3B (a really big number, an order of magnitude bigger from what they are used to). Because they priced the shares actually not existing.

After RH stopped the buying action of shares (which he was not going to be able to deliver), the NSCC lowered the collateral (liquidity) to 700M.

Also not restricting the selling action was benefitial for them because they had to no longer deliver those shares.

RH is still rising as much money as it can (maybe because they are also pricing a necessity to deliver by themselves the actual shares).

As the GME ""failed to deliver"" data spiked as the stock price was rising, the failed to deliver shares are entering the ""Aged fails"" list later this month.

&#x200B;

This is not investment advice, but I think this is a discussion we should have.

From a comment of [r/DustinEwan/](https://www.reddit.com/user/DustinEwan/):

I was actually just looking at this data last night and [compiled a graph and a bit of information correlating the ftds to the price](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9jbc5/listen_to_me_we_cannot_trust_the_short_interest/gljxh9z/).

I've since included the January data released today. [Here's what the updated graph looks like.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT-zGW9XnxrTZIwm5cYOGbu8p9Xn7b9CzoXhl7_BqpkKLHYQmgFt03_OGkbFNXzhCwqqNKNX5brjlK6/pubchart?oid=1460942882&format=image)

And here's a spreadsheet of the source data. This is straight from the SEC link the OP provided:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT-zGW9XnxrTZIwm5cYOGbu8p9Xn7b9CzoXhl7\_BqpkKLHYQmgFt03\_OGkbFNXzhCwqqNKNX5brjlK6/pubhtml](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT-zGW9XnxrTZIwm5cYOGbu8p9Xn7b9CzoXhl7_BqpkKLHYQmgFt03_OGkbFNXzhCwqqNKNX5brjlK6/pubhtml)

To put things in perspective, there are \~69.75m shares of GameStop issued by the company. From January 1, 2020 to January 15, 2021 there have been **81,789,932** failures to deliver.

If all of those FtD's are resulting in IOU's in the market that are never fulfilled (that is, a counterfeit share was created through illegal naked short selling), then GameStop's price would have been diluted by **53.9%**.

Put another way, those participating in naked short selling would have *stole* 53.9% of the market cap from GameStop shareholders. In dollars and cents, that would be a theft of roughly $228,886,696 (assuming a share price of $6.08, which it was on January 1, 2020).

Edit:

Furthermore, if we assume that these hedge funds are continuing to short at the same rate, then at a share price of $300, they would have stolen another **$1,522,481,100** just from January 15 - January 31.

If the price crashes, they get to just pocket all of that. This is why they're pulling out all the stops to kill this thing.

If  we sell and the HF's drive the stock back down to lets just say $50 ...  That means all the hedges that spent millions upon millions shorting  the stock in the 2-3-400's have made and absolute killing!! This could  be upwards of a 20-30X gain depending on where they originally shorted  GME and mostly likely it was in the 10-15 range. Even if they shorted it  at its peak in the 40's that is still most likely a 8-10x gain.

We brought it this far, and relenting would be doing a massive disservice to GME for any future plans they have! Since they have not released any news, one can assume they did not take advantage of the 3-400 price range and sell some stock to fill their company's bank. So now with it around $150 and going lower, unless this takes the rocket to Mars, we put them in an even tougher position than before.

Can we trust the #'s every guru seems to be posting on Short % and all that? Who knows! The people dont play fair and there is no telling how many people they paid off to spread fake news!

Soooo  in summation, if you sell, you just bought all the hedge funds we have  been fighting new yachts and a 6th house due to the massive bonus they  will pick up off this and their new extremely high short position that  will take another small army to beat down.

Been trying to post for days maybe this will be the magic time it gets through.

First of all this chart is one gigantic ascending fucking triangle, 🐂🐂🐂. That’s insanely bullish.

Second the company is sound and has some first mover advantages. First to market EV pickup, The Endurance, expected September 2021. Purchased an GM plant with the capability of producing 600k vehicles a year to help speed up production. 

Third the environment is right. Biden wants the US government to use a 100% EV fleet.  Earnings are expected on 2/15 where they’re pre orders will probably blow expectations out of the water once again, and any mention of a potential government contract would send the stock soaring.

 I’m hoping we break this ascending triangle pattern and ride the EV wave to new highs going into earnings.  Maybe I’ll earn some trendies 🚀🚀🚀🚀but prob not since I’m fucking retarded and live on my wife’s boyfriends couch. This is not financial advice.

Aphria and Tilray Combine to Create Largest Global Cannabis Company With Pro Forma Revenue of C$874 Million 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201216005519/en/

>Under the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Aphria will receive 0.8381 shares of Tilray for each Aphria common share, while holders of Tilray shares will continue to hold their Tilray shares with no adjustment to their holdings. Upon the completion of the Arrangement, Aphria Shareholders will own approximately 62 percent of the outstanding Tilray Shares on a fully diluted basis, resulting in a reverse acquisition of Tilray, representing a premium of 23 percent based on the share price at market close on December 15, 2020 to Tilray shareholders. On a pro forma basis for the last twelve months reported by each company, the Combined Company would have had revenue of C$874 million (US$685 million).

The cannabis industry as a whole has extreme growth potential. I recently made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lab9sk/the_rolling_20s_leaps_on_cannabis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) illustrating my views on US Legalization & the opportunity with long term plays. We have entered the ~~roaring~~ rolling 20’s, where cannabis regulations will ease dramatically.

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Aphria & Tilray are slowly taking over Europe. 

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of Aphria, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face to create desired synergies.

>More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through CC Pharma, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**What is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is a leading German Pharmaceutical and Medical Cannabis Distributor that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019. 

Last week, CC Pharma [inked a deal](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/amp-german-cannabis-group-and-aphria-s-subsidiary-cc-pharma-gmbh-enter-into-strategic-co-promotion-agreement-for-the-sale-of-medical-cannabis-in-germany-897696119.html) with AMP German Cannabis Group.

>AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, ""information events"" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, ""We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.

**Tilray & France**

The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in [France](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005149/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Selected-by-French-National-Agency-to-Supply-GMP-Certified-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-France) 

>it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

>In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Aphria/Tilray will be first in line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised to be the best.

As long as GME make the most of their new brand image they can easily see Tesla speed growth. They have their work cut out for them but they have the #1 most important thing (brand image). Think how well Elon Musk does with his brand of being the people's champion/saving the world. (whether you believe Elon Musk really is people's champion doesn't matter, the fact is his brand is super effective). People will fear shorting GME in the future (just like they fear shorting Tesla - just look at billions lost by shorters on tesla). For this reason after the short squeeze I will spend about 50% of gains buying back into GME with a target price of $100-$200. 

tldr:

* GME is now a legitimate value investment due to the value of the free marketing/brand image they are receiving.
* Reddit do not forget.
* People will fear shorting GME like they fear shorting Tesla
* Epstein didn't kill himself
* It is just a matter of time until GME start releasing exciting news about how they are using this exposure/branding/money to grow their business.

If any of you cutie pies weren't busy eating crayons and looking at your bedroom wall whilst trying to comprehend the deeper meanings of life, you'd probably have an actual job. The irony here is that I'm going to go about my career in movie production(I know it's not an actual job don't mock me) and what's been going on there for the past few years after Netflix started their expansion. [This](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bOTyoAE6VrRCAZ5GEOg3J?si=Vw4NHRN_TFSsXnCVcleURg) is a really good podcast episode , which I'll TLDR for you cause you retards can't keep your peanut-sized brains concentrated for more than 3 minutes:

Netflix and Amazon have only been gaining profits since covid came to the west and their counterparts - the movie theaters have only been suffering losses. As with any business this creates enormous leverage for both of these companies to  buy off an entire franchise in order to completely monopolize the market.( I don't mean to judge, this is just natural). I guess you could argue that streaming is way more convenient, but if you were to actually read up on that Google Scholar research you'd realize this is not the case for the community and 🦍 just want to look at big screens. The platforms just need more places to display their prepaid Hollywood star-packed productions so that they can earn that sweet sweet money, because you'll all go watch that movie, because of that hot actor/actress (that's right I don't discriminate). And even if that isn't the case(highly doubt it), you'd still watch it because it's Netflix. It's only but natural for them to want to want to buy stocks of movie theaters at a discounted price. Does this remind you of something you should be doing right now? 

All in all this is just some industry insight argumentation that only supports not selling anything be it GME(which hasn't shifted to online only because chairmen didn't want to have to fight with Mr. Bald Headed Smeagle Jeff Bezos(we wouldn't have been in the position we were today if it had)) or AMC, but don't follow it as financial advice, because I, like you, am retarded too."|2021-02-02 17:09:36.920627|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170941.csv|DueDiligence|['AMC']|['AMC']|['I', 'J', 'TLDR', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'AMC', 'I']|['AMC']

I'm not going to repeat all the excellent DD you can already read on the front page. I however will bring up some important thoughts about the publics' spending habits. Buying shares above $150 a share is very expensive for Joe America, average citizen who doesn't do a lot of investments. I have been floored by the number of people willing to spend their real hard-earned money on this movement so far. Congrats to you for keeping all of us afloat. 

We have all seen that VOLUME is very important for keeping GME share price up but volume is not necessary for the ladder attacks to drop the price down. So why haven't they run the price into the ground yet? Because they risk volume jumps. The moment this stock drops below $100/share dramatically increases its affordability. The cheaper it gets the more people will be able to justify adding more to their portfolios. This is exactly what the hedges don't want. They are already in a share shortage. The last thing they want to do is drop the price of GME so low that it causes a massive buying spree. 

So how do they fix this? They do it with FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt). They want the world to think the money train has left the station and all that is left is free fall. They want to crush everyone's spirit so that when it comes time to ground that price, no one will want to buy it. WE CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN. We need to keep our heads high and TRUST that the short positions have not been resolved. We need to TRUST that the Hedges still have a ton of debt obligations that need to be rectified. Any time we see the share price dip below $100 I suggest buying every share you can get your hands on. I know I will. They will be testing the waters over the next few weeks just to see how much enthusiasm is left for this stock. The rollercoaster will get worse. and seeing red for days/weeks is a test of our collective willpower. 

DO NOT SELL WHEN IT JUMPS TO 800. Do not think this is some lucky fluke and to get out while the getting is good. This is WHAT THEY WANT. They want to crush you so that when they give you crumbs you jump on the chance to show some return. 

TLDR: HOLD, BUY LOW, HOLD until 10k 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.
Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.
I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.
I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use .

1- short the stock cause I wouldn't know how long this would take
2- place a large portion of my bets in put options near zero, cause I would make way more $ that way then just shorting the stock.
3- returned all my used games to GME local strip mall location, cause who else will give me $1 for my old games once GME is no longer?

Focussing on point 2, it's not like you would put billions in a single expriation date. I would probably have splitted this across a couple. Since that trade would have been place 6-12 months prior, probably stick to monthly expriation dates and avoid weekly due to volume needed to be moved.

So Feb 19th is a standard expiration date, so I would expect the short will try to get out 2 days before that day. Probably not successfully do it, and therefore rest will play out at expiration on the 19th. Another chunk will follow the week of March 19th. 

Why not unwind now, it's a losing position and greed will make them want to use as much as the time they can. Because they got burned last time, they won't wait for the 19th, they'll try 2 days before.

Looking at the option calendar, the prior non-weekly expiration was Jan 15th. First expiration of 2021, which would have been a logical date for a first put option taken a year prior. So let's look 2 days before (that's Jan 13th for you artists)... This is when everything really kicked in high gears.

On the 12th GME closed at $19.95, volume of 7M shares (anything prior was also consistently low volume.

But on Jan 13th, volume blew up to 144M shares, GME rose 193% to a high of $38.65 intraday. Looks insignificant today, but that day if was a major change in volume pattern that kicked off what we've seen since.

TLDR: HOLD GME, squeezes happens on monthly expriation calendar, not weeklies. Upcoming one is Feb 19th. So HOLD and buy the dip.

Yes I know it has been quite a harsh week. Manipulation, Counterfeit stock, lazy SEC, fake news, and major loss porn. However, retards strong together.

Please mods, do not just delete this post. I am trying to make a quality post here to show Yahoo Finance we not completely retarded and Gamestop is going to the moon soon.

\---

For years people have thought that investors and market participants are rational. We make choices based on probability and outcome. But here I will give you an example of why we have paper hand bitches in this sub.

Let's say you have to make two decisions.

**Decision 1:**

**A = Sure gain of $240**

**B = 25% probability of a gain of $1000 and 75% probability of a gain of 0$.**

**Decision 2:**

**C = Sure loss of $750**

**D = 75% probability of a loss of $1000 and 25% probability of a loss of 0$.**

&#x200B;

Think about it for a moment before I give the correct answer.

Yes you will take choice A and C. Or B and D if you like to gamble.

But what if we calculate the gains and losses.

&#x200B;

**A & D:**

25% prob. of a gain of $240.75% prob. of a loss of $760 (240-1000).

**B & C:**

25% prob. of gain of $250.75% prob of loss of $750.

So why do you retards pick other choices than B & C, while B&C is the best combi. Because you are subject to **loss aversion.**

What is loss aversion? You facking hate red more than you love green. This is what is happening in the retarded brains of paper hands. You see red, you hate it so much that you don't want to hold for the green at the end of the war.

We tend to accept a sure amount which is less than the maximum amount because you are a fucking paper hand. 

Next to this, you tend to solve the problem in isolation because you are subject to **narrow framing**. You  are so retarded that you only think of green. But do not forget, DFV hold on for over a year. However, he did his math, his DD, his fucking 8-ball game, to know that in the end we will win.

So in short. Switch off you emotions and think about the Gamestop situation as a case. Be aware of the biases and the mind games hedge funds are playing with you right now.

Posting some info on Corsair and for the new members about what we call an 'earnings play'. Corsair manufactures and sells parts for computers, especially gaming computers, as well as the peripherals used in streaming and gaming. Covid has understandably provided a large uptick in sales and we are coming up on Q4 earnings in 8 days, which will include holiday sales. The stock traded as high as $51.37, and has traded between $35 and $45 for some weeks.

What you need to know:

\-Relatively small market cap (3.43 Billion)

\- Q4 Earning's release: Feb 9th.

\- Recently announced a new product (solid state drives) Jan 28th

\- Expected earnings were recently adjusted, higher:

Net revenue: $1,651 million to $1,666 million.

* Operating income: $186 million to $192 million.
* EBITDA: $194 million to $200 million.

\- Tied for first place in the 'computer hardware' category, alongside Logitech

\- Last quarter Corsair reported a 100% earnings suprise (0.52 vs 0.26 earnings per share)

\- Lockup period for sale of insider shares expires Late March, though the recent announcement to sell non-diluted shares direct to institutions at $35 is promising.

&#x200B;

Christmas sales will likely be focused around peripherals, like head phones and streaming gear.

A number of Corsair execs announced they will be selling shares direct, ie. will not dilute common shares, direct to institutional investors at $35 per share. This will, hopefully, reduce volatility in the stock, as there is relatively little available for trade, most of it being locked up with execs and institutional owners. It should also set a floor on near term pricing.

Analyst currently give the company a 'Buy' and 'Strong Buy' rating.

TLDR: buy CRSR.

Earnings date: February 9th.

All time high: $52.37

Current: $38.13

But could you imagine that one of these short squeeze names not only has A LOT more room to squeeze (and hasn’t been restricted by many brokerages), but is still a **value** play even after the massive run on shorts?

That’s what we have with TR.

It’s been pointed out that TR is heavily shorted with 45% of its float short. But if you’re looking for squeeze potential, you should be paying at least just as much attention to days short: if a name has limited liquidity, the shorts will have a hard time exiting their positions regardless of the nominal short interest.

Days short on GME was just 2 as of mid-January, and even at its peak reached no higher than 25 days way back in July. AMC is just 1 day short, and reached no higher than 7 in October.

TR? It’s STILL 45 days short as of the same date.

**GME: 2 days. AMC: 1 day. TR: 45 days.** That’s higher squeeze risk by an order of magnitude going by that metric.

The shorts are 7.3m shares deep in their short positions on TR, but the stock typically trades only 125k shares per day, and it didn’t pick up nearly as much volume as the other squeeze candidates like AMC and EXPR last week. **While AMC, EXPR, etc. are up 3-4x on the squeeze trade, TR is up only 33%. But if TR even begins to make a move similar to theirs, the shorts will have a very hard time exiting due to the tight float and limited liquidity, and the stock could squeeze very, very hard.**

What makes this so potent is the mechanics of the float: just 25% of TR’s shares trade freely. Compare this to 40% for GME and AMC, and as high as 85% for BB and EXPR. There are only so many shares out there that the shorts could possibly cover.

Where are the rest of these shares? They’re with CEO Ellen Gordon, who owns 50% of the common and 85% of Class B shares. Another insider owns another 5% of the common and 15% of the Class B. Gordon has been on the board for 50 years (!) and there is no record of her selling a single share going back to 2000 at least. In fact, no insider has sold a share since 2013, and before that 2008. These are the ultimate diamond hands.

This is effectively a closely-held business that just happens to trade publicly. Worried that we might get burned by insiders like we did on AMC with Silver Lake executing the massive convert and making it easier for shorts to cover? Not here. The insiders don’t sell and the shorts will be stuck covering on the tiny float.

And compare the risk in TR to the other squeeze plays at this stage of the trade. EXPR, AMC, etc. are all up 3-4x over the past week, but are all companies that were and are under legitimate fundamental pressure (as they were even before COVID) and facing real liquidity issues, which is of course why they were so heavily shorted. TR is up just 33% on the squeeze but is absolutely fine financially. Sales have been steady and remarkably consistent at $520-550m for years, and are down just ~10% due to COVID. It has over $100m of cash on its balance sheet and no debt. It generates consistent free cash flow, which was as high as $80m last year. This is a brand that everyone knows with no real lasting fundamental pressures, and is not going away anytime soon.

The kicker? This thing probably has UPSIDE on the fundamentals. It’s very likely that company gets bought out by a strategic buyer once the long-time CEO (now 90 years old) passes away. For how much? TR did $197m of gross profit in 2019. Let’s say it gets bought out by Hershey’s, which probably shares all of TR’s distribution channels and could wipe out just about all of its (extremely bloated) sales, marketing, and administrative spend in a buyout. Tax-affect TR’s gross profit at HSY’s effective tax rate of 17%, apply HSY’s forward P/E of 22-24x, divide by 66m shares outstanding…

**…and you see that TR could easily end up getting bought out for upwards of $60 per share. And that may not be too far off.**

**So why is it still trading at $40 per share even after the run on heavily-shorted names? Beats me. But I’m buying at these levels (as is whoever made those large bullish option purchases late last Friday…).**

**TLDR: This is not just another lottery ticket short squeeze play that’s already been carried into the stratosphere. This is an early-stage squeeze that never got picked up by WSB quite as much as some of the others – and even after the once-in-a-generation broad-based squeeze, this one hasn’t reached nearly its potential given the low float and limited liquidity, which makes its days short ratio 22-45x HIGHER than the other squeeze candidates, and which will make it very, very hard for shorts to cover. TR is up just 33% while the others are up 3-4x, and it’s not even trading where it should be on the fundamentals. If you’re looking for another squeeze candidate (and one which the brokers haven’t restricted as heavily) but are antsy about how extended the high-short-interest basket might be – this is your “value squeeze” play.**

And, honestly, why didn’t this one get picked up as much by WSB? What stock could be more memable than Tootsie Roll? Everyone knows it, everyone loves it…who wouldn’t be tweeting about Tootsie if this got some play?

By the way, unlike AMC, whose theaters are closed across much of the country, TR is a company that we could support **directly** - go out and buy some Tootsie Rolls. Think about the power of the crowd that WSB showed in bringing GME stock to light and apply it to TR: **If we get just 30% of us WSB retards buying the 36-count boxes on their website for our imaginary girlfriends for Valentine’s Day, that’s over $100m in sales, more than 20% of TTM revenue.** Here’s an opportunity not just to buy the stock but to justify it on the fundamentals – by creating the fundamentals.

Right now this sub has become a fucking hell with all the shitpost hanging around. Didn't we have a Flair for that ? You lost 5 dollars ? Fuck off, stop crying, its WSB not your mommy's skirt. You want to sell when others are telling you to ? Fuck off, do your own research, its WSB not advising. You want to bring down other autists with you because you paper handed and you feel bad ? Fuck off, keep it to yourself and take whatever you got (either win of loss) like a fcking man already.

Now to your crayon eaters, here we go. I'll adress the major bullshits we see on here : Is the squeeze squoze ? And Why is it going down ?

# SQUEEZE SQUOZE NO NO

Actually it's pretty easy on this one. The short squeeze can happen because of the tremendous amount of shares being shorted, and to those of you saying ""But ... but ... s3 said 50%, they covered and...."" **FUCK YOU ALREADY. DO YOU EVEN RESEARCH?.** Here's a link with ACTUAL bloomberg terminal data : [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labst6/gme\_and\_amc\_short\_data\_taken\_from\_bloomberg/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labst6/gme_and_amc_short_data_taken_from_bloomberg/)See that 31.01.2021 with ""Short"" = 61M on GME ? Yeah ... exactly, not squoze yet. Oh and by the way, for the most retarded of you all, ""**float% = 122%**"" should ring a bell. The second they buy back the shares we see two things : 1/ Huge trading volume and 2/ Spike on share's price.

The last days were ultra-low volume : [See yahoo finance here](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/chart?p=GME#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) and do comparison with when it rally'd up.

With low volume, the price also went DOWN significantly... so neither 1/ or 2/ have been done at the moment.

If you can't do research this is why the sub is going south.Why would they do this ? Shord ladder drives down the price, so HF can enter lower, make money on the way on top, then short on the top to make money on the way down, (If you think they are not playing both ways, you have nothing to look for here), scaring the paperhands of yours to sell on the way down, helping them get their head out of the water a little bit.

With the new arrival on this sub (Hello 5+ milions people), it has become really a hard moment finding decent answers to our questions and it has become WAY EASIER to concede to FUD because of all the shitposts going on. I'd like to ask this from you now  : Stop shitposting, post with up-to-date data and source (as much as you can), and if you can't, don't post. If you lost 100$, dont post, it's not loss porn and the sub is wallstreet B.E.T.S! If you come to cry for all losses, at least make them a million dollar one, or else stfu. I'm getting tired of the crybabies.

What this means is it can’t be shorted when dropping in price. Only when rising in price. It’s a small victory but should prevent short ladder attacks that have taken us so low this past few days. Couple this with relaxation of restrictions on buys but add to this the restrictions outside of USA it should slowly rise. 
This post explains it as I’m a retard and haven’t a clue what I’m saying. 

Short sale restriction is a rule that came out in 2010 and it's also referred as the alternate uptick rule, which means that you can only short a stock on an uptick. This is kind of an unusual thing when you first think about it. It restricts the ability to short a stock as it's dropping down. You will note that there is no such thing as a long buy restriction where you can't buy a stock as it's going up.

This rule was designed to prevent downward really volatility. It was designed to prevent flash crashes and big drops in the market by making it so if a stock dropped more than 10% vs the previous day's close, and that could happen at any time during the day, if it drops more than 10% vs the previous day's close, then at that time short sale restriction would be turned on. If you wanted to short the stock, you could only short it when it's going up. You can't basically use a market order. You can only get in on a limit order on an uptick.
This has the effect of making it difficult to short a stock that has short sale restriction. Because it's difficult to short, what we'll sometimes see is that stocks that have been really strong for the last few days ... Let's say yesterday a stock squeezes up from $4 all the way up to $5 all the way up to $6. Then the next day it opens at let's say $5.25. It opens down 10% from the previous day. Then the bell rings and it drops to $4.85, now dropping another 10%. Short sale restriction is turned on. It's down more than 10% versus the previous day's close. Then it starts to squeeze back up on a red to green move.
Now as it surges up traders who are thinking man, I want to short this stock if it hits $6.00, which is the previous day's high, well they can only short it as it's going up. They can't short it as it turns around. That sometimes means there's going to be an imbalance between buyers and sellers, and there will be more buyers and less sellers and short sellers because it's just not as easy to short the stock.

Only then will they maybe get margin called or trigger their risk protocols.

This depends crucially on the price they started shorting. For example, if a HF shorts 1000 shares of GME at $4, and it is now $100, they have $4000 cash and a short interest of $100,000, with a loss of $96,000. Meanwhile a hedge fund that shorted at $300 and the stock is now $100, is sitting on $300,000 cash, a $200,000 gain, and $100,000 short interest.

Unfortunately, according to Ihor/S3's data (giving him the benefit of the doubt), the current GME short interest is 8.8 billion on 27 million shares shorted. This means the current shorts started at $325 dollars a share. For us to meaningfully hurt their books we would have to drive the share price to like $400-$600 \*without\* a short squeeze before a short squeeze happens. That takes a lot, specifically 10s of billions of dollars, so I don't see that happening soon, even with whales etc. on our side. Sadly, the broker shenanigans seem to have given them a chance to slip out.

(GME data: [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356261806612885509](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356261806612885509) )

So now what? The best we can do is hold and wait for material events to happen related to the turnaround. As Ryan Cohen succeeds, we will have the winds behind our back to try this again in a few months.

In the meantime, consider these stocks instead: FUBO and BBBY. Both have decent businesses and high short interest at a reasonable price.

(short data: [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1354847896173240322/photo/1](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1354847896173240322/photo/1) )

FUBO is a growing streaming platform that is great for live sports. It is growing and has a lot of wall street analyst support. It is heavily shorted at 67% of float, with the shorts in at $50. Wall street analysts have also recently set 50 price target, and the stock is at 50. FUBO is thus a great candidate to paint some HF books red.

BBBY is not as good of a target, but has a credible turnaround story like GME, and is currently sitting at $26 dollars, with the shorts in at $52 according to S3. This could move with an order of magnitude less capital than GME before the shorts start seeing losses.

So we all know that NOK is a value play. This further puts NOK as leader in the tech right now. They already have a ton of contracts dealing with 5G. They are talking about 1T, but today announced 10G rollout as well. If that doesnt mean anything I dont know what does. The down play in the market today is because of its link in the BANG gang. Most of the other 3 have dropped, pulling it down as well. But dont let that fool you. Its a long play. IT IS IN NO WAY A SHORT PLAY... We really have to drill that into peoples heads. .... and for sake of my self.... I'm not a financial advisor... LOOK AT THE NEWS....

Following up with a 3rd DD after posting these gems last year: [$OZK](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j52m4n/bank_ozk_the_new_century_financial_of_the_current/) &  [$FIT](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j9zayy/why_fitbit_will_trade_higher_than_735_acquisition/). Both were excellent disasters, so sorry to the degens who followed me down those holes. Nonetheless, I doubled down on my $OZK play because I still think they're shit. 

Moving on, I believe $BLUE is on the verge of FDA approval for one or both of it's key gene therapy drugs. The company currently has a beta thalassemia drug conditionally approved in the EU (Zynteglo), and has a sickle cell drug that's awaiting approval. Last year was rough for the company as it struggled to get approvals, while it continued to burn through cash on its cancer drug research.

The company will be splitting off the cancer division later this year into a separate company, so it can enable both new companies to focus better on their respective applications. As a result, $BLUE is trading below 50% of where it was a year ago, despite having two fully developed drugs in the pipeline.

On to the DD: $BLUE has just posted a role on its website for a VP of US Sales for Zynteglo and the Stem Cell drug [Career Site Link](https://boards.greenhouse.io/bluebirdbioinc/jobs/2291768). These roles are expensive and hard to fill in Boston, indicating that $BLUE feels like they'll need a US sales team soon.  

The Play: Jan 21 2022 Call, $85 strike. It's currently trading at $3.90 per contract. The option will pay out a 100% gain if $BLUE increases to $90 by December '21. Considering this stock reached a high of $230/share on successful trial news, an FDA approval will send this stock soaring. Obviously there's huge risk here, but $BLUE seems to think things are looking up based on their hiring.

TLDR: $BLUE is a pharma stock trading at a discount considering FDA approval may be imminent; they just posted job openings for a US sales VP."|2021-02-02 17:09:36.920627|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170942.csv|DueDiligence|['FDA']|[]|['DD', 'I', '$OZK', 'I', 'I', '$BLUE', 'FDA', 'EU', '$BLUE', '$BLUE', 'VP', 'US', '$BLUE', 'US', '$BLUE', 'FDA', '$BLUE', '$BLUE', 'FDA', 'US', 'VP']|[]

I   am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I barely   understand how the stock market works. Professionally I'm a   computational researcher -- my job is to simulate complex systems that   my smooth brain barely understands.

Okay fellow retards,

loooong time lurker and europoor autist. So excuse my spelling. Let’s brake some things down:

SILVER:

It’s   a real well played scheme on this. You have to remember there is a   dragon in the east, where people have a historically deep bonding to   silver. And the dragon looooves to take a gamble. So, number one   priority for Melvin and hedge fund friends is to distract the dragon   from GME with shiny silver. Imagine HFs did not throatfuck GME on   Thursday and the dragon banged into the marked, heavy. This uprising of   the dragon is exactly what this autist observed by comments on wsb late   Wednesday, early Thursday. If HFs didn’t screw the market exactly this   moment and pulled some silver shiny stuff out of their pockets, they   would have already been toast.

Besides   that, try to find silver shorts/put options for a reasonable   spread/price which are also available to buy. I tried the whole day   yesterday but at least at my europoor broker I couldn’t find a single   one. What tells you that? Looks like **smart money is not buying the silver rush**.

&#x200B;

ANTI GME  BOTS:

These guys are getting their **bots more and more angry and aggressive**   over the last 24h. But why would they still take the effort, if they  already hit their targets? All this shows to my retarded autist smooth   brain is that they are in deep fear! Hey, bot guys I just want to quote   one of your clients: “What's your beef with me. I'm just trying to make  a  living just like you” ...I hope you guys got payed in advance,  because  your clients will likely go out of business!

Anyways... just to repeat **the obvious: They try to create fear among you retards** and make your diamond hands become weak ass toilet paper!

To   close this part I just want to quote some famous investor from Omaha:   (Be) “fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are   fearful.” I’m an autist, I don’t feel fearful at all. I simply can’t…   But for some reason the bot guys are. They seem fearful as fuck to me.

&#x200B;

SHORT INTEREST RATIOS:

So I hope most of you guys realized, they simply changed the formula to calculate **SI rates**. It’s basically **still \~120%**.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read\_this\_they\_are\_screwed\_numbers\_dont\_lie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/)

In science you would say they normalized the standardization:

You   take your observed value also into account and add it to your base   value. Eventually your maximum number can only be <=1 or in other   terms <=100%, In this specific case you take your number of shorted   stocks and add them to the float as a base value. Then you divide your   number of shorted stocks by the base value (including shorted stocks)   which can only be smaller then 1 or 100% in respective. ...inflate the   base to make things look completely different… Anyways my smooth brain   is able to convert the equation to the old standard (shorts/float) which   is based on S3s latest 55% short interest rate (Just to make it easy  for your autist brains):

shorts/(shorts   + float) = 0.55 → 0.45/0.55 shorts = float  -> 0.81 shorts = float   →  shorts = 1/0.81 float = 1.23 float or 123% of float.

[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)

...in   addition you have to keep in mind, big players always have taken fines   and trials into consideration as costs. I don’t know what the fines  for  misinformation regarding number of shorted stocks are, but if you  are  scared to death you should:

First   of all, not show it to your retarded smooth brained enemies by   recruiting bot armies, obviously lying, silver bullshit, other FUD,   ...you name it.

AND you are   willing to take any risk to survive. ...or fines   ...in this kind of   situation probably any kind of fines no matter what.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But  why would they do this? Whats their business with the Hfs? You ask  yourself? You guys are threatening soooo many business models in   finance. And this is the real **game changer**!

Keep   in mind: On stock markets you mainly trade the future. You have to  make  scenarios for the upcoming future. And there is a horrifying  scenario  for boomer financial services arising at the horizon. But  first let’s  bring it to the crucial point first:

Look for **information asymmetries**,   google it or whatever… That’s what it’s all about in the end. That’s   the main reason why big players make shit tons of money from small   players. It’s all about information sovereignty. Or the information   monopoly… however you call it. The one who is (quicker) capable to   gather more accurate information and hide it from others, wins. Like   buying your investment decisions and order limits from RobinHood.   Sometimes it’s even enough to convince your enemy that you are in   possession of better information. (By the way, this fight about   information sovereignty is exactly what you can observe right now. HFs   try to convince you retards that they have better and more accurate   information about the whole situation.)

So, lets come back to the bullet point:

Imagine   a huge crowd of people on social platforms gathering more and more   accurate information and take investment decisions on that. Because of   declining information asymmetries constantly draining money out of it.   This will drastically change the current state of the market in means of   clients to financial service provider relations. Making it a more   liberated, fairer market in some kind. ...the whole industry would lose   trillions in the future. So yeah, you guys did it. You scared a big   chunk of the whole financial sector.  Not with GME in particular but with this way of investing.   Therefore from the financial industries point of view this transition  process MUST be stopped and delayed at any cost. This is literally the  clusterfuck for boomer financial services! And the worldwide media and   wsb are the battlegrounds right now.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But   hey, I’m just a short minded, stock loving retard, having a lot of fun  on this! GME to the moon! Planing to buy some dips today because I’m  way  to autistic to feel anxious about ridiculous 100 stocks short  ladder  ping pong.

(written Monday so ""tomorrow"" = Tuesday 2nd"")

If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.

If you don't sell, the price won't go down. Buy and hold on mass can make everyone, especially the initial investors very rich. It is the basis for the recent gains in tech. The public sentiment is creating value in many of these companies. Just look at ZM. It's a direct consequence of democratized trading and it will become more and more influential. 


Everyone has the misconception that a stock's price is determined by some true value+potential of the company. In fact, the potential of a company is actually in part a function of stock price. This means that a large group of buyers of the stock can directly fund as well as motivate managers and CEOs to stay interested in building a successful company. I'm sure the new management doesn't want to squander our support. The price is a barometer of public reputation which is a strong indicator of longevity. That's what the market wants most in the end. 

Democratizing trading will allow publicly popular companies to redeem themselves financially. In a sense, it is a safety net of public faith. If gamestop management can capitalize on our support, the is real potential it can turn itself around. I spoke to a relative of mine who was a former manager at a gamestop who said that the new management dreams of turning stores into social hubs like Starbuck's. By cultivating a friendly environment for gamers, they can capitalize on an open market. This will be especially successful if a roaring 20s type decade unfolds (assuming the vaccine is successful in stopping the virus, which it is poised to do so far according to researchers like Nicholas Christakis at Yale).  This would ensure gamestop becomes a physical environment of the gaming community for the foreseeable future, occupying a niche I think no other company is better positioned to seize. 


I say let's fund that dream and reap the spoils.

First – Monke Diamond Hands Banana Rocket Rocket Rocket Rocket Moon

**This is not financial advice. This is speculation based on my limited understanding of SEC rules and documents. Sources linked.**

**TLDR**: My opinion is that Shorts will continue to drive the price down with ladders and try to break the chain of consecutive days where GME is listed as a threshold security. **They need at least 1 non-Failure To Deliver day before EoD Thursday. If they get even 1 day without aggregate Failure To Deliver then the entire 13 consecutive day count restarts. They need 5 consecutive days without aggregate Failure To Deliver to have GME fully removed as a threshold security. Selling is good for them and bad for diamond hands. Ape strong together. Diamond Hands get the Rocket Ship.** No idea if achieving 13 consecutive days will force the squeeze or not.

My opinion is that Shorts don’t plan to cover their position by Tuesday. They don’t have to. Instead, they will drive the price down for as many days as possible and attempt to break the chain of consecutive settlement (read: business) days where they fail to deliver. GME has been listed as a **threshold security** (see below) for 10 consecutive business days (please check my math. I had to count on my fingers). Shorts need to break that chain before it reaches **13 consecutive business days**. “Participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in ‘threshold securities’ if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.” \[SEC Rule 204\] (link below)

**If diamond handed monke can HOLD strong and reach 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, then the shorts will have to cover the position by buying GME shares or equivalent shares of like kind and quantity. If maths good, that puts Thursday Feb 4th as day #13. Ape hold strong.**

We've seen confusion, fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding what happened Monday Feb 1st. Remember that FUD is one of their greatest weapons against retail investors right now. They want to use it to divide retail and to convince people to sell based on emotion. I’M NOT FUCKING SELLING!

Warning: I am not a financial professional or a financial advisor. I read at a grade-3 level. This is not financial advice.

\*Read below here if you can or care.

1. Why no squeeze Monday after $320+ close on Friday?

Shorts weren’t required to cover their positions on Monday. I think that they have T+2 (time of close + 2 business days) to cover their position. If true, this means they have until EoD Tuesday to cover. After that, they will have failed to deliver on the security. That isn’t good for them, but it isn’t as bad as it sounds. Failure to deliver is like a steppingstone in the process. After 5 consecutive business days with Failure To Deliver, the stock is listed as a security threshold. NYSE Threshold Securities can be checked here [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

It takes 13 consecutive days being listed as a security threshold before the positions must be closed (If the rules still apply to them).

So, instead of covering, shorts spent the day driving the price down to a more favorable position for them. They may have scared away some paper hands along the way too.

2. How does that help the shorts?

Lower price means it costs less to cover and the Shorts have more room to negotiate with other funds. A cheaper darkpool buyout is good for them. If they can lower it enough, covering becomes a non-issue compared to a full on squeeze.

Shorts want to avoid days where GME fails to deliver and they want to create non-Failure To Deliver days to break the chain of consecutive failures to deliver. This is easier for them if the price is lower.

3. So squeeze on Tuesday/Wednesday right?

I don’t think the squeeze happens Tuesday or Wednesday. I think the shorts are setting up the next part of their plan. I think if the squeeze happens this week, it happens because the shorts reach 13 consecutive days where they fail to deliver. This means diamond hands and limiting the number of cheap shares that shorts can buy after ladder attacks aka diamond hands.

4. We’ve heard this before. So what?

I agree with the idea that adding RC & friends to the board had a positive influence on the stock price. I don’t think that was the only thing happening when we saw price rise during mid-January. Going back to the idea of 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, we can refer to our NYSE tracker [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

Starting at the beginning of the year, we see that Jan 4th is the first day GME is marked as a threshold security. It stays listed as a threshold security through Jan 15th. Remember we don’t count weekends so the count resumes January 18th. On the 18th, it falls off the list for the day and comes back on January 19th. Without this single day drop-off, the 13-day countdown would have ended at EoD Wednesday Jan 20th. I believe that the price jump we saw can be partially attributed to the fact that shorts NEEDED to avoid another Failure To Deliver or they would risk being uncovered. That was pre-spike. Now they are in a similar position closing in on the 13th consecutive day. They will do whatever they can to avoid that 13th consecutive day because that means they will avoid having their record books searched through by someone outside their firm/fund.

**Threshold Securities**

Def: Threshold Securities are equity securities that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for

· Five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency; and

· Totaling 10,000 shares or more; and

· Equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer’s total shares outstanding.

If you see any mistakes or if I missed something, let me know. Looking to keep this as accurate and up to date as possible.

Conclusion: Hold banana with diamond hands to board the rocket ship

First post here. 

Listen up, I want to talk about the volume charts on GME along with everything we’re seeing right now to help you make the decision to be a 💎🙌 chad or paper handed b***. 

My thesis: GME to the moon, and the negative price movement we’re seeing right now is a non-fucking-issue. 

Some facts:
-RH restricted trading for GME past few days pushing price down synthetically 
-silver bots spamming WSB
-simultaneous coordinated media attacks to control the narrative telling us that retail has pivoted to silver
-Melvin down >50% in JANUARY (oops)
-S3 data looks fishy 

So back to the volume charts. “Oh shit GME is down” whatever, it doesn’t matter. Here’s why I’m confident that this is purposeful, possibly short ladder attacks. 

At open 1/28, 2/1 and 2/2 MASSIVE volume for those days both at open pushing the price down, which was followed by low volume. 

My interpretation: HFs trying to dispel hype and our faith by large volume selling at open (look at counterfeit stocks, can’t find link) to depress price and kill momentum. 

Not financial advice, just my interpretation and why I’m down 50% but don’t fucking care. 💎🙌

From Today's AMA with Mark Cuban, READ THIS.

""If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.

Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.

I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.

I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.""

I see some WSB posts that are totally panicked. We need to remember why we are here in the first place. Do you want to see the Hedge funds win? NO! then HOLD THE LINE AND DON'T SELL!!!! 💎🤲💎

I got a few PMs about my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laww2w/legit_proud_of_all_of_you_for_not_selling_this/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and what that little blue line called on balance volume, or OBV means. OBV basically gets a positive or negative value based on if the prices are going up, or going down at that time. So in theory, when price rises, OBV should rise at the same rate to that increase, and vice versa. 

However, the useful thing about OBV is in the name - it's weighted by volume. This means the more shares that are bought/sold, the steeper the OBV line (or gradient). So in this gamestop selling run, we would expect such a crazy price decrease to be followed by a similarly crazy decrease in on balance volume, since a lot of shares would not be in the hands of retail investors, theoretically. However, the OBV line has barely moved. What this means is that the price has decreased far below what most people are holding it for, comparing it to the first OBV rise last week when everyone bought into GME. This in turn means that the price is being changed by barely anything, and it really hangs in the balance of a few trades right now.

**But what are the statistics???**

In today's price drop we saw 5 million shares negatively impact OBV against a total balance of 1.1 billion, that's a factor of 0.5% and is microscopic compared to a daily increasing rate of 25% last week. That's why everyone here is going on about volume - there isn't any. If you're still confused, go on tradingview and bring up the on balance volume indicator, and look at the past 7 trading days.

A certain 5G stock #knockknock has been getting hype for a few weeks now and it has REASONABLY been ignored because we support our brothers fighting the good GME fight.

NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT

everyone keeps complaining about how high of a float this stock is. 

I GUARANTEE you that is not an issue. The publicity that this got this week was unprecedented. We bought so much that these fucks are restricting us from buying a leading 5g stock that has been around since 1865. My broker told me I had to cancel my sell order because it was stuck in citadels order book. What the FUCK does that mean? We are being suppressed for a reason. HEDGE FUNDS LIKE THE STOCK

And guess what motherfuckers!? I LIKE THE GOD DAMN STOCK TOO!

Price target $50+:

1. Most essential 5G patents in the world
2. Fastest 5G speeds recorded
3. Controls over 27% of the 4/5G market
4. First company contracted to set up internet on the moon (NASA)
5. Will receive MULTI-BILLION dollar settlements from ongoing litigations with Mercedes Benz and Lenovo
6. Technology provider and main collaborator of the National Security Center of Excellence 5G Cybersecurity Project (Federal 5G project)
7. Selected to be the main collaborator of the Hexa 6G European Union Project
8. Has pending Department of Defense contracts yet to awarded
9. Just sealed a contract with TMOBILE for US 5G roll out.
10. Has and will take market share from Huawei, already has secured multi-year deals with important Chinese companies
11. Blackrock increased their position to 333,000,000 shares during 2020, an increase of 21 million shares held from the year before (7% increase)
12. May also be getting back into the phone business as they are manufacturing phones in India
13. Vanguard Capital owns 160,000,000 shares and is continuously buying
14. Google Cloud announced a partnership with $NOK to Accelerate Cloud-Native 5G Readiness for Communications Providers

TLDR: 
$50+ price target
Buy #knockknock 
6k shares and growing

My theory is that they were dumping a lot of stocks onto the market to make it seem like the stock is plummeting. Just look at this bid with 30k shares:

&#x200B;

[a lot of ask's with a \(relatively\) big volume at once ](https://preview.redd.it/8rrkvhr133f61.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=21f0ed5ea7661f596f47ec077aaa851114c46611)

The good news is that it seems like they can't keep up with the volume since most of us are holding the stock, and because most retail investors already bought GME, it seems like the demand is going down.

Sometimes it feels like you are all alone with owning this stock. And it would be nice to have some discussion about the company, and to hear other investors' views on the stock and the company. Which, in my opinion, is not necessarily the same thing. The company is doing very well, but what about the share? Nothing!! Why?

It is very difficult for me to understand that we are still at these low levels!
When the oil price has recovered to over $50 and stands at $57/brent at the time of writing. We should get up to the levels we had at the end of 2019 and start in 2020!! To begin with…

”So only there is a nice rise for the stock!”

Certainly the oil price was higher then between 60-65$ barrel. 
But then there was also uncertainty surrounding krg's payments, which were not paid between Nov-19 and Feb-20 of $41.7 million. Which we will probably soon see start being paid back. At least if we are to believe in Genel, GKP and Dana Gas who have notified the market of this.

Below I have gathered a few things that make me look bright on the future and that the stock feels interesting to own.


Refund from KGR

That we see  KRG begins repayment of the debt for delivered oil between Nov-19 and Feb-20 of 41.7 million dollars. If we get this money into the bank, it looks very good for the valuation and cash flow!

https://genelenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Genel-Resumption-of-override-payments-FINAL-11.12.20.pdf 

https://www.danagas.com/media/press-releases#sec-5986 

https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/gulf_keystone_petroleum/news/rns/story/w6qe47r  

Why doesn't SNM do the same? And why don't they answer the question of refunds and give feedback to the market when I ask them? Is this in Taqa or what is it that is taking so long? Here I see the closest trigger for the stock! So it's very frustrating that they don't communicate this course-driven information to the market! 

I think they can be much better at communicating to the market, what the stock needs are new buyers and higher turnover to attract interest from larger investors. Which is an absolute prerequisite for an higher valuation of the company. Here, the company management needs to become much more active in its actions regarding marketing the company. Why don't they do more to be seen?






Increase in Company Gross 2P Reserves

We should expect an update before February is over. There can certainly be positive surprises here. What is interesting is our reserves in relation to our production and what has been communicated around development plans for the field. I can't make up the math here. www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5222/corporate_presentation_-_dec_2020.pdfPage 2 108.5 million barrels 2P/C It produces today according to page 4. An average of 46,300 barrels per day with an ambition to raise these significantly. To 80 000-100 000 a day!108 500 000 / 46300 = 2344 / 365 = 6.5 So in about 6.5 years, you're out of oil? No, I don't think so. More oil will be transferred to 2P/C but the question is how much and when it will happen? 

How much oil is there in Atrush? I believe in a lot of oil...



KRG and Baghdad
Will we finally see a solution between KRG and Baghdad on the budget? And what will it mean for IOCs operating in KRG if SOMO receives 250 bpd, will Baghdad see the contracts as legal? And how will investors view the companies operating in Kurdistan? Does some of the risk disappear? And the companies get a completely different valuation?

Sarsang and Total

Very exciting things are happening in the neighboring block, Sarsang, where Total is possibly on its way to sell its share of 18%. According to Bloomberg, Total believes it can get up to $ 500 million for its part. And if they get close to that price, that would be very positive, for the valuation of nearby Atrush! And who could be the buyer? I think that the Russian companies in particular is strengthening its presence in the area. But time will tell. 

www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-04/total-said-to-be-in-talks-to-sell-stake-in-kurdistan-oil-field   


Plan for expansion

It will be very interesting to see if there are any decisions, about expanding the field to 80-100bopd. This was to be decided on, in 2020 but was put on hold when Covid-19 became a fact and the oil price crashed. But now it's time I think to make a decision on the issue regarding the future expansion of the field.

Here I see the greatest potential for an upgrade of the company. Here, future company value and future belief regarding Atrush's ability to be the company's basis for stability and sole asset are determined. I would like to see the use of cash flow to acquire new assets. And that the company can grow further with higher share prices as a result! 





”Installation of Second Trainat Early Production Facility""

I think it is very interesting to look back at information that the company has given before. To create an image of where they are today or in the near future. If you look at the presentation from August. 

Page 8 www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5196/corporate_presentation-shamaran-rev10.pdf 

So it will be very interesting regarding the opportunity to see an increase of production in the very near future. Wonder how far the company has come?

”Installation of Second Trainat Early Production Facility. Second productiontrain (EPF.T2) brings current Atrush processing capacity in line with well capacity circa 58Mbopd.” 

Is it already installed and they can easily screw up prod 10,000 barrels / day? There is a lot that justifies this, among other things, if you get the debt back from Nov-Feb faster. That calculation becomes much more appealing if you count on 55$ barrels/brent, which we are a bit over now at the time of writing, and a production of 58,000 barrels / day. I do not see it as completely unlikely that in the foreseeable future we will hear from the company that they will increase production to these levels. This is, after all, information from August and it is quite reasonable that we are there today.


Conditions for earning. As everyone knows, the price of oil is very important. And here I think we will see a surprisingly large re-inhibition of the prize in 2021. What happens to the oil price is always uncertain as it can change overnight both up and down. But there is much to suggest a strong recovery in demand. And this, at the same time as investment in the sector has been declining for several years. This could be a perfect storm for oil prices if supply cannot meet demand. Shamaran produces at a very low cost and here there is an incredible leverage with a higher oil price.
www.macrovoices.com/guest-content/list-guest-publications/4009-art-berman-macrovoices-jan-7-2021/file
And for every dollar that the oil price increases by, the higher the earnings for snm. Here I think the market will change attitudes towards oil stocks overall in line with a higher oil price.

36mil in volume is not a lot! These guys shorted around $5 so unless the stock hits $5 you're fine. Even then, you're fine if we don't sell. Don't be paper handed. Most retailers are still holding.

This is a once in a lifetime chance. Red is just a color, it will change if you hold and buy the dip. I plan on buying more near end of day myself!

**The short itself will probably happen after Thursday Feb. 4th.** This is because that would be the 13th consecutive day of Failure to Deliver on a threshold security. But this only happens if the shorts can't deliver the shares they owe. They're trying to illegally drive the price down so when they buy back they can avoid a squeeze. I'm a literal retard, but I have a feeling the price is gonna start going back up on Thursday or next week. Maybe someone can explain more

**Retail investors own over 100% of the actual shares. This means the price goes as high as we want it to go. It will keep climbing until we sell. They are using every trick in the book because they know they're f*cked! This is literally free money if we all hold. There is nothing they can do but try to scare you.**

I sold my meager 40 shares like a paper handed bitch a few days ago, but have seen the error of my ways and I've been buying back in. I'm going to buy over 40 shares this time to make up for it. HOOOOOLD.

Lastly, remember to remove your stop losses so you don't sell!

For SEC interns, this is not financial advice. Idk what I'm talking about. I like the stock. Ryan Cohen is great.

**EDIT:** [More on the whole 13 consecutive days bit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/layb2c/cutting_through_fud/)

I know it’s a joke around here, too many words can’t read, I get it. Information is a valuable weapon, stop voluntarily ignoring it.

I am not a financial advisor, I just like the stock, and that is why I am going to provide some insight into how GME arrived to the position they are in, and how WSB arrived to the position we are in now.

**GameStop Backstory**

I will briefly cover the backstory of GameStop, but for more accurate information and in depth discussion I recommend you listen to Rod Alzmann’s GME DD as a guest on the Modern Guilt podcast found on Spotify. 

Essentially, GameStop began to slip as E-commerce grew and management went through several changes before arriving at what we have now. As a result, earlier management tried to pivot away from GameStop’s core competencies (large user base and trade-in/second hand sales) which pushed it further into misfortune. Eventually the board we have now chose to double down on their core competencies and improve upon them rather than restructure entirely.

**WSB Backstory**

Leading up to the now viral GME bonanza, this sub and the strategies used were much different. GME started off as a value play, although a significant subsection of that following always had their eyes on a potential squeeze play. The following was small at first, but grew as GMEs potential grew. The core competencies of the following consisted of excellent DD, knowledgeable users willing to share research, and less knowledgeable users willing to learn.

I no longer feel as though this is the core competency of GME gang, the strategy has shifted towards strength in numbers and raw unadulterated conviction. That is not a bad thing and I will get to that later.

Once the GME squeeze became apparent and the sub was soon consumed almost entirely by GME gang, the original competencies actually flourished. Users provided excellent research on the mechanisms at which hedge funds could be held at bay in the midst of the squeeze. The prevailing strategy was to buy shares only, never use margin or over leverage yourself, and not to purchase options. 

Those competencies were what made WSB unstoppable in the begging, and they were based on pure reason alone. Buying shares would reduce float and put pressure on HFs, avoiding margin and over leveraging would prevent users from panic selling or liquidating due to margin calls, and avoiding options would concentrate power into a strategy that gave hedge funds little wiggle room.

These strategies worked, and you can check the first week and a half of the GME movement to confirm that it was rock solid. But then something happened, people saw opportunity and started buying options on the side or completely instead of shares. Because of the original momentum this actually ended up benefitting the strategy significantly, it resulted in all calls ending ITM on the Friday before last week, it produced a gamma squeeze.

But that tactic is short lived, the MMs quickly started writing a vast spread of options and priced many users out with premium. **The options strategy is no longer feasible in the near term, momentum is gone and the options ladder spreads traders too thin.**

I understand the allure of options, but just consider the amount of money that vanished last Friday. Calculate the cost of all of those options from $330-$800 and consider how much ammo was wasted. Yes, it was stolen form you, it wouldn’t have happened if not for manipulation and brokers blocking GME buys, but it is time to adapt and overcome.

**Return to your core competencies, and improve upon them. Stop ignoring thorough DD and stop neglecting to do your own, do not allow your fellow members to post information without scrutiny. Return to the original thesis**

**Improve the Core Competencies**

We are in a grim stage of the squeeze and many are nervous, but it is essential at this point to steer into the skid. **If you read anything in this post it should be this.** The stock price falling gives us strength if you look past the fear. The squeeze is about leveraging the small amount of float that is urgently needed by hedge funds. Hedge funds have an abundance of money, but they lack the volume to close their positions. Individual retail investors lack money but they are capable of leveraging the scarce volume available against HFs. 

Think about this, HFs are burning money to drive the price down but they need shares to stop bleeding. When the price is low, retail investors become more capable of obtaining shares. The price being low puts HFs in a **bad position**. At low prices retail investors are able to hoard large quantities of shares, further increasing the scarcity. For those of you who bought or are willing to buy at $250, $300, $400 etc, I salute you but I don’t encourage this behavior. 

Buying high spreads your resources thin and results in diminishing returns. **Let them trigger the short sell rule, let them give you a discount**

A squeeze can start at $1 or $1000, it doesn’t matter, and the base cost of the stock equally doesn’t matter in an infinity squeeze.

Return to your core competencies, allow hedge funds to bleed themselves dry in their effort to deter us by lowering the stock price. Buy when the price is cheap, allow it to inflate naturally, and wait for it fall again before loading up more. Once the resources are entirely out of reach for the hedge funds, there are three ways to win. A positive catalyst, natural price growth, or simply allowing them to bleed themselves to death.

Options are no longer effective, consolidate your efforts.

Do your part to spread and scrutinize important information. 

Stop slacking and letting others pick up the work for you. If you’re still on Robinhood, set up a fidelity account or an alternative immediately. If you’re still on margin take it off. If youre still allowing your broker to lend your shares call them. Get extended hours trading. Get off toxic brokerage platforms.

Return to your core competencies and stop running in circles.

I am not a financial advisor, nothing in this post should be used as investment advice. This is my take on a purely speculative situation, and I recommend you do your own research before entering or exiting any trade. I like the stock and own GME shares.🚀🚀

**TL:DR: for starters, stop slacking off and actually read DD posts, information is essential in warfare. Stop buying options, they were an effective weapon that was purposefully neutralized by MMs and now works against us. Return to the strategy that got us to this point.**

This is for the GME boyz

Just like last week, we are under a low-volume short ladder. And just like last week, bulls are hindered by brokerages' restrictions.

However, a remarkable thing happened today: GME tested a previous ATH/resistance ($76.76). GME first pulled back from that price point on Jan 21st, when the price opened at $42 and closed in the $60s. It was the first day ever trading was halted intraday, and our first massive win against hedge funds. $76.76 slapped us in the face and called us his bitch.

**So, why is today's price action bullish?**

Because when a stock tests previous ATHs and it **BOUNCES OFF OF THEM**, thus turning a resistance into a support, it's a sign that the stock is still healthy and has potential for an even more powerful run. **PLTR did that, NIO did that too in the past.** They went sky high (not as GME duh), tested previous ATHs, then kept flying to their own moon trips.

Now look at GME recovery.

And imagine how high it's going to fly again once brokerages let us monkeys out of our cages by lifting restrictions. Yes, GME could test the $500 resistance again after testing the $76.76 resistance now turned into support.

Guys, I don't have the vocabulary to explain how bullish this is in my opinion. I am blessed I can buy GME on my broker, looking forward for an amazing run through Q4.

**To GME newbies: this has always been a Q4 play. I was expecting the squeeze to happen after Q4 ER revealed what a powerhouse GME is, and I still do. Accumulate, hold, squeeze, cheer.**

First, non of this is financial advise&I'm not a financial advisor
Secondly, I'm not sure if this fits in DD since this is more psychology so mods please correct the flair if I'm using the wrong one.

That being said:
I know y'all retarded apes don't want to read, but bear with me here. 
The current fact we all first need to acknowledge is that the price of GME has dropped significantly, and that the volume, albeit still low, is higher than yesterday to say the least. People have started to sell, and other where on Reddit people are starting to belief this thing is all over and we're a bunch of cultists.
Now the question I know y'all want to know: Is it over yet?
Short answer:Likely not, but it depends on us.
The very basis of the reason many of us believe GME with go to the moon in the first place, that it is HEAVILY shorted, *still holds true*. According to the volumes for the last few days, the restrictions still going on, and the media fake-silver hype, the HFs likely haven't covered their positions yet. Many of them likely even added new ones, as they believe the price is going to fall. The potential for going to the moon is always there, it never changed. What has changed, and can potentially truly wreck this spaceship, is our mentality. Due to the price drop, which, started with the HFs with their dirty tricks, people are starting to panic, and this panic, which is caused by a false manipulation, CAN wreck GME. People are less likely to buy in as they're afraid this is not ending well, and people are more inclined to sell due to the dropping and seeing all the other people selling.
*Spamming 💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌 will NOT stop people from selling or panicking. It only serves to make them think we're a cult*

*What to do*
What is important as of now, whether you're still in, already sold, or has been speculating the whole time thinking this is over and all these poor cultists are going to end up in shit. Is to understand, and not just blindly belief, that *the stock is still heavily shorted, and this fact NEVER changed*. If we all understand this fact we *win*. The only potential source of this failing is our doubt amongst ourselves. I urge everyone to take a deep breath, and ask yourself: *Do you really belief that the HFs are truly out?* If the answer is no, than the best thing we can do is to recollect ourselves, regain the faith(which should not be blind faith but faith backed by reason) we had in each other and in this stonk, and HOLD AND BUY. 

TLDR
*Our whole reason of doubt is our own doubt. The entire thing is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If we all believe we win we win, if we all believe we lose we lose.(Yes this includes you bystander, we are all in this together) The fundamental reason the we believed GME is going to the moon has NEVER changed. HAVE FAITH that is BASED ON REASON. Blind belief is NOT solid, and can only get you so far*.
The stock is at a low, and this is a great opportunity if you sold earlier to get back in again. If we come together and have faith in reason, we have a greater chance than EVER to send this to the moon, wreck Wall Street, whatever you're in this for at the beginning.
*Unity and belief in reason, not fear, makes us strong*
*GME TO THE MOON BUY AND HOLD*

To rebuild faith in reason: 
-Welcome discourse, don't call everyone a bot
-Actively engage in discussions and focus on the fact that the stock is still heavily shorted as ever
-Spam less emojis, more rational discourse, appear more collected so people don't think we're a bunch of crazy cults sinking with the ship"|2021-02-02 17:09:36.920627|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170939.csv|DueDiligence|['GME', 'IS']|['GME']|['DD', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'AVILY', 'CAN', 'GME', 'NOT', 'NEVER', 'I', 'HOLD', 'AND', 'BUY', 'TLDR', 'GME', 'NEVER', 'HAVE', 'FAITH', 'BASED', 'ON', 'EASON', 'NOT', 'EVER', 'GME', 'TO', 'THE', 'MOON', 'BUY', 'AND']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

BUT THIS IS WHERE YOU LISTEN. To all the new investors that have just joined this sub over the last week and a half: Buy, the fucking, dip. It’s really that simple. So when I was eating crayons and having not fucking a groundhog five years ago, my novice dumbass investing brain thought you sold to save anything you had left - that was WRONG. Instead, when you buy more shares at a lower price, you LOWER YOUR COST BASIS.

What does this mean?

It means if you bought 10 shares of GME at $300 and then bought another 10 at $80, your cost basis is $190. Essentially, you’re not only lessening losses but you now have the potential to make even sweeter tendies. Now, when the price goes back up to $300 (which it will, because we are lubing that groundhog anus), you will now have a gain of $2,200. Yes, you’re buying more shares, but you’re now getting better value. That’s what fucking matters.

I’m a former financial adviser that left the business back in 2012 because I was tired of the manipulation by large institutions. The game is rigged but understand the game if you are going to play.

What is GME worth- for all of you that like the stock. I think what you are saying is that you like video games, and the culture around gaming, and you want to support is a company that promotes those ideas. I can fully get behind that. And I can hope the GME management took the run up in stock price as an opportunity to bring some of your new capital in, and continue to restructure and develop a really amazing company around the future of gaming.

At some point though the price of GME stopped being about GME fundamentals or even a restructured growth story and started to be about a short squeeze. A very valid reason to buy the stock. Watching this all play out I noticed there was a point that short interest stopped going down. Institutions are sharks and will sell their grandmothers for a few dollars but many belong to larger entities that are not about to let a small trading arm take down their whole company. When the shorts stopped covering it wasn’t because they were continuing to hold onto their losing bet. But it was because they had already lost. The legal entities and their clearing houses holding these short positions were already theoretically bankrupt. It did not matter what the overnight borrowing costs to short the stock were and it didn’t matter what the price went to if the entity was bankrupt at $300, it is not More bankrupt at $400. You can be right about bankrupting some Wall Street institutions but still lose money if you are paying more for your trade than you will ever get back. My theory on the trading range over the past week is that some long side institutions said it wasn’t worth owning over a certain amount and were willing to buy at maybe $150 but wanted to sell at $300 (these numbers are theoretical). Bankruptcy payouts take a long time, and if your money is tied up waiting for a bankruptcy judge to approve who gets what money... well that can take years. Not ideal for portfolio returns.    Summed up there is some value that can be extracted from the shorts but that dollar amount is not infinite. There is an upper bound on the short squeeze price.
Also, and this is more speculation the longer this goes on the better Wall Street will be at extracting value out of the bankrupt institutions and shifting more risk to the bankrupt entities, and unwinding risk off of the other entities. If you are bankrupt you don’t borrow your last dollars from your credit card to put it on black, you put it on fucking 17 and hope the payout bails you out. And if you and your friend are both in trouble you talk your friend who is already bankrupt into borrowing a few more dollars (because no one can save him anyway) and “giving” you that money so you can get out debt.

Long-time lurker but decided to post because we need to keep this sub fun and bring positivity!

I've  truly enjoyed this sub over the last few years and at first I came for  the memes (guilty) but stayed for the community. As with most of the  world and especially the US life has been pretty challenging  over the  last year.  For me, that's meant an anxiety and depression cocktail  which not even my wife's boyfriend could help me get out of. I stopped  caring for myself and caring about anything really and although I keep  trying to do my best nothing had been able to get me out of this.

That  changed two weeks ago when my friend and I decided to go in on GME and  just see what happens. I went from checking this sub a few times a week  to pretending to read nearly every quality post and the excitement,  banding together, and support I have seen and felt over the last 2 weeks  have been amazing! It jolted me back into caring at least a little bit  about myself and life. It didn't solve the challenges I face but I feel  more alive than I have in over a year and it has helped me see I can get  out of the dark place I was in with some help and putting in a little  effort each day to change my behaviors.

I  appreciate all of you (Not you paper hands though) and please drink  water, exercise, try and eat healthy, and take time to disconnect once  and a while. Care for the people in your life and any strangers who are  not billionaire hedge fund managers or billionaire wealth hoarders.

WSB stocks have been rising and falling together for days now, even though they are very different stocks that people are in for very different reasons. This has the potential to create some bargains. I wanted to do a quick rundown for those who are unclear on why. The stocks I'm going to cover are GME, AMC, BB, NOK, and I'll touch on SLV (and why it's not a WSB stock)

**GME: The squeezening**

GME was trading at $4 a share 6 months ago. People on Wall Street were treating it like it would be the next Blockbuster. The fear was the people would buy their video games online and make the company obsolete. Hedge funds started heavily shorting it, expecting it to go bankrupt within a few years. Even if it was, 138% short interest is insane. They were asking for a squeeze. 

Also Gamestop is not that much worse positioned than any other brick and mortar retailer. The pandemic cost them in the short term, but they can survive. Is Macy's going out of business because of online shopping? Maybe eventually, but for now they're trudging along. Gamestop even has some advantages over other retailers, in that they can buy used games for pennies on the dollar and resell them for dimes on the dollar. If you do that with clothes you're a goodwill. In other words: **we like the stock**

There was really good news concerning vaccination, so the pandemic sell-off started reversing. As the stock price came back to pre-pandemic levels, Ryan Cohen joined the board (previous CEO of Chewy) there was hope for the future trajectory of the company. This absolutely screwed the short sellers, leading to the short squeeze. Gamestop has become a short squeeze play. It's speculative right now. It won't be worth $500 a year from now, and no one believes that. But it also won't be worth $4 a year from now. 

**AMC: GME's little brother**

AMC has a similar story to GME, except less hope. The cinema industry has been decimated by the pandemic, but that doesn't mean that the company is closing imminently. The company became undervalued, and with hope that the pandemic was coming to a close, the price started coming back to pre-pandemic levels. Short sellers got caught with their pants down. They got squoze, and lost a ton of money.

AMC is different that GME in that cinema's were having huge problems even before the pandemic. Also unlike GME, there is no e-business guru joining AMC's board. I think GME has hope long term, whereas I am much more skeptical for AMC. The short squeeze means that the stock will have crazy volatility in the short term, but long term I'm not sure where it ends up.

**BB: Not GME**

Blackberry is known for making cell phones for boomers, but they have shifted dramatically. At this point, Blackberry is a cybersecurity company:

https://marker.medium.com/how-blackberry-yes-that-blackberry-became-a-cybersecurity-company-efae02912751

BB is also interesting because they are really involved in the cybersecurity of self driving car technology:

And with the solar winds hack, they were listed as a possible beneficiary. 

Blackberry has a partnership with Amazon, and has partnerships in China as well. BB is nothing like GME or AMC. It's a medium risk high reward stock that could hit $100 within 5 years or could do nothing. 

**NOK: Definitely not GME**

NOK is similar to BB in that people think of them for their phones, but they... don't do that anymore. NOK is a 5G company now. They have 2 major competitors in Europe, Ericsson and Huawei. Yes, that Huawei. The one that no one trusts because they are probably selling your data to China. It is likely that Huawei gets regulated out of Europe, which is a gift to Nokia. The company has partnerships with T-Mobile and Google:

Nokia is a low risk medium reward type of stock. It's trading at around $4.50 right now. I would be surprised if it didn't hit $5.50 by EOY. But I would be just as surprised if it hit $9. They look to be giving out a consistent dividend, which might bring some big pension accounts on board. 

**SLV: Not a WSB stock**

I think I saw 1 post on SLV here, and suddenly it is a WSB stock in the media. Someone posts here about SLV every once in a while, talking about silver to gold ratios or some shit. SLV is a scam. SLV does not create value. It's a commodity. Institutional investors are all over it. There's no law that says it has to have some ratio to gold. Literally the first law of the stock market is that past performance does not determine future results. 

Notice how SLV is the only stock out of all the ""WSB stocks"" that is not trending together. GME, BB, NOK, and AMC are wedded to each other even though they are obviously very different. SLV does it's own shit. I really think this SLV thing was just a way for some hedge fund to cover some sneaking shit they were pulling.

**ALL THAT SAID**

If GME or AMC crashes after the squeeze and that leads all the other ""WSB stocks"" to crash, BB and NOK present huge opportunities. I personally am going all in on NOK if it goes under $4 a share. 

**TL;DR**: GME and AMC are short term, high risk, high reward short squeeze plays. BB is a longer term, medium risk, high reward play. NOK is a longer term, low risk, medium reward play.

The game has changed.

Hedge funds seem to think that driving the price down is in their best interest, **it is not.** Here is why.

A short squeeze results from a low availability of shares. The price of the share does not necessarily matter for a short squeeze, and it does not effect the magnitude of an infinity squeeze.

Hedge funds need a lot of shares, and they do not want to buy them for a lot of money. They do, however, have a lot of money. Hedge funds believe that it is in their best interest to drive the price down and scare other out because they are way too over leveraged. **But the price decreasing is actually not in their best interest**

Driving the price down allows retail investors to maximize their ability to hold shares. Once the amount of free floating shares is too low, hedge funds panic much like the VW short squeeze. For the price of one share on Friday (~$330) you could have purchased 4 shares today (~$82). Hedge funds can outpace us when shares cost a lot of money, but we can fight back when they are cheap.

Furthermore, allowing hedge funds to drive the price down can trigger the short sell rule which restricts their ability to drive the price down further. Let them drive the price down, let them trigger that rule and then load up.

Slowly the resources will be out of reach for the hedge funds, and they will have no choice but to cover. That is when you get to name your price, everything in between is just for show.

I am not a financial advisor, nor a professional by any means. All information and discussion in this post is purely speculative and hypothetical. I am retarded. I own GME shares.

I found a great quote on [nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com) that summarizes how fucked the shorts are going to be.

""Here’s An Example Of How To Short A Stock

For example, let’s say ABC stock is currently trading at $10. After doing your research and due diligence (DD) you think that ABC stock could fall to $5 a share. You will then contact your broker, and your broker will lend you shares of ABC stock that you will then sell in the open market. In this example, let’s say you short 10 shares of stock. 

So, after selling those 10 borrowed shares of stock, you now have net positive $100 cash in your account. Next, ABC stock drops to $5 a share the following week. You will then do what’s called “cover your short position” by buying the stock back. In this case, you buy back at $5. Lastly, you will pay your lender back the shares you borrowed and profit the difference. So with 10 shares as the example, you, as the investor, would profit $50 shorting ABC stock from $10 to $5 a share. 

It’s crucial to note that, despite some investors having made their fortunes by short selling, it’s considered a high-risk investment strategy. The reason being is because short selling has infinite risk. In simpler terms, the amount you can lose by shorting a stock is unlimited.""

What we are seeing today is the HFs trying lower the price of GME in order to scare retail investors. They squeeze has not been squoze.

(insert a lot of rocket emojis, diamond hands and all that.)

I am a degenerate and this is no investment advice. Do your own DD and don't spam me. I increased my GME position today at 80$. But what do I know? I just buy GME and today it was cheeper than yesterday.

This was part of 6198 options already exchanged today and 19,261 contracts bought since Friday. 

iShares Global Clean Energy ETF is the largest clean energy ETF and has the most liquid options market of any of the ESG funds. Jan 2023 began trading last Monday, and July 2021 and Jan 2022 have also seen tens of thousands of contracts traded almost entirely at highest strike price available ($45) in recent days. 

Why? IMO These options are hella cheap with IV around 50% on an ETF that has QUADRUPLED (from low of $8) in past year with top holding (PLUG) up 1800%+ in past year. 

If ICLN “only” doubles to $60 in next year and IV reverts to historical mean of ~80%, $5.8 options @45 would be worth at least $20 with still a year left to expiry. 

And this $10M is really nothing compared to Trillions in capital already deployed by the US, China, and Europe as part of economic stimulus plans all centered around clean energy (the US joined this wave with Biden’s plan). TRILLIONS in direct subsidies in conjunction with TRILLIONS in quantitative easing by the Fed and other central banks. As just one example, PLUG has completed two secondary offerings in past few months to capitalize on stock price and raise billions to build 5 hydrogen plants, 2 operational next year. 

So in summary while the focus has been on GME etc in recent days, over 10 million dollars was quietly invested knowing TRILLIONS in Stimulus + TRILLIONS in Cheap Money could make for very nice returns."|2021-02-02 17:09:36.920627|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170942.csv|DueDiligence|['M']|[]|['I', 'ICLN', 'ETF', 'ETF', 'ESG', 'IMO', 'IV', 'ETF', 'UPLED', 'ICLN', 'IV', 'M', 'US', 'US', 'LIONS', 'LIONS', 'PLUG', 'GME', 'LIONS', 'LIONS']|['ICLN', 'ICLN', 'PLUG', 'GME']

Alright retards, listen up. Move your shares from your broker to direct registration. This puts the stock in YOUR name and not your brokerage (this is the electronic equivalent of a physical stock certificate).  
Meaning it will FORCE them to secure a REAL share. If our theories about the ladder attacks and naked shorts are true (significant counterfeit shares), the 
hedge funds will have a DEFINITE date that they will no longer be able to cover (3-21 days depending on how / when enough shares get moved over), even with the bullshit tricks up their sleeve. And when that happens.... fuck the moon, we're going to a new fucking dimension!

Someone tell me I'm wrong. Until then, fucking **HOLD**. 


**How to move your shares:**

It should be as simple as phoning up your brokerage and having them move the shares to DRS. They will have all the info needed as long as your account is up to date.

After that, you simply need to sign up with the registered transfer agent for GME, which is found here: https://news.gamestop.com/shareholder-services/investor-faqs

I contacted both Fidelity and the transfer agent (https://www-us.computershare.com/Investor/#Contact/Enquiry) and verified all of this. The transfer agent will offer the same trading services as a brokerage,
except they aren't pooling our shares together and you have COMPLETE control over how your share is used. This account would be only for GME. 


In reality once the % of float was moved over we'd start seeing the effects. I'm sure someone better at math than me could figure out the exact % needed.

Am retard. Not fin adviser. Additional DD on this subject in my profile.

Edit: 

More info on DRS ""DRS provides investors with an alternative to holding their securities in certificate or “street” form. Under DRS, investors can elect to have their securities registered directly on the issuer’s records in book-entry form. With DRS, the investor does not receive a physical certificate, instead receiving periodic account statements (at least yearly) from the transfer agent or issuer evidencing holdings. Dividend/interest payments, proxy materials, annual reports, etc., are mailed from the issuer or its transfer agent directly to the investor.""


Edit 2:

Big sad my fellow retards. While this plan would technically work (even somewhat validated by the fidelity equity rep I spoke with, he said they'd have to ""locate the shares"" first), I no longer think it is cost effective. The fidelity website page I saw for DRS transfers had them listed as free, but upon talking in more specific details with fidelity it would cost $100 PER SHARE to transfer. You literally cannot convince me that the system is not entirely rigged against the retail investor - we can't even truly own our fucking shares. I expect other brokerages are probably similar. I suppose one could do a free ACAT transfer to a cheaper broker, then DFS transfer from there but to do that in enough volume seems impossible."|2021-02-02 17:09:36.920627|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170939.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['YOUR', 'FORCE', 'REAL', 'INITE', 'DRS', 'GME', 'I', 'PLETE', 'GME', 'DD', 'DRS', 'DRS', 'DRS', 'DRS', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'DRS', 'PER', 'SHARE', 'I', 'I', 'ACAT', 'DFS']|['GME', 'GME', 'DFS']

You really only have 3 options at this point:

1. Make money
2. Make a ton of money
3. Lose money

So how do these 3 come into play?

1. HOLD.  If you hold the shares you currently have, we will climb back up and you will have your tendies.  The squeeze is coming.  The hedgies are beyond fuk right now.  Hold, and sell at $10k.  This was always the plan and still is.
2. HOLD and AVERAGE DOWN.  You already know you're going to make money because the hedgies are fuk.  Want to make more?  Lower your cost basis!  If you bought in at $300, right now the stock is cheap as hell.  If you bought 10 @ $300, and buy another 20 @ $120, your cost basis has now dropped to $180.  In addition, you have now have 30 stocks in total, further fuk'ing the hedgies.  This is the smart play.  The people who will be driving Teslas to Valhalla dripping dip sauce all over themselves while eating tendies are doing this.
3. Be a paperhanded bitch and sell cuz you're scared.  You lose money and have no hope of profiting off the hedgies being fuk.  You lose a ton of karma and WSB calls you a poonanny for the rest of your life.  You will eventually see the massive amounts of profit everyone else takes and you will cry.

* the number of shares sold short (short interest) divided by average daily volume.
* This is often called the ""days-to-cover ratio"" because it determines, based on the stock's average trading volume, how many days it will take short sellers to cover their positions **IF THE PRICE GOES UP**

# EILI5

* a stock has a short interest of 4 shares
* average daily volume of shares traded is 20

# What is Short Selling?

&#x200B;

* Short selling is the opposite of buying stocks.
* It's the selling of a security that the seller does not own, done in the hope that the price will fall.
* You can borrow the stock from your broker-dealer, sell it and get the proceeds from the sale.
* **If the stock price declines, you can close out the position by buying the stock on the open market at the lower price and returning the stock to your broker. Since you paid less for the stock you returned to the broker than you received selling the originally borrowed stock, you realize a gain.**

What was the price of $GME last week? It was over $200, over $300, over $400 even...What is the price of $GME now ? $117 and as low as $74.

# If I opened a short position at $300, and closed it out at $74.22 the very bottom of the day.....maybe the price goes up a bit because lots of shorts closed for a profit....and sold to all of you who thought you were ""buying the dip""

Based on Reddit Logic, it's impossible for any other person or company to have shorted the stock after it went above $200. Of course they did, that is an absolutely ridiculous price. Everyone knows what happens AFTER a short squeeze...look at the VW chart. It's easy to understand that a $300 price of GME wouldn't last that long, so if you short it at $300...why would you close your positions now when it will continue to drop? More it drops more you make.   


You all keep going back to the thought that Melvin who shorted at 4, 5, 10 dollars a share...has not covered.

Just wanted to give you an update on the IFF Short and gamma squeeze opportunity I brought to WSB yesterday.

It is great news! The cost to borrow shares continues  rocket upwards (44.7%), and they continue to use borrowed shares to try and keep down the price.

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/IFF

There is a good options ladder this week (at $135 and $150), and there is a monstrous option gamma squeeze at $150 for Feb 19.

This is also a very valuable company, which will see significant growth in their price to sales multiple, now that their acquisition of DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences is complete.

Here is the Ortex data, showing the current number of borrowed (short) shares is at 61m:

Now I'm in pretty deep and been following the story relentlessly.

Robinhood replaced restrictions on the stock RIGHT AS THE SHORT LADDER ATTACKS STOPPED. They seem to only place restrictions on trade when it goes up, never when it plummets. They're trying everything to freeze the price or lower it at any cost to stop its momentum. Robinhood restricting last Thursday could've been a fluke in market manipulation since they were completely broke and literally couldn't afford to buy anymore stock. But THIS, THIS IS BLATANT MARKET MANIPULATION WITH NO ROOM FOR SPECULATION. They now have ample funding as seen in their stupid ass tweets and the correlation between NYSE stopping short ladder attacks and them placing a max cap on how many GME stocks can possibly buy is just TOO MUCH! They're doing everything in their power to stop this stock and it's actually scaring me a little. If they can pull this illegal crap with no punishment, I've completely lost faith in our free market. I've already filed a complaint to the SEC about this issue and I hope you guys do the same. This war is far from over.

(Edit): I know that exchanges freeze stocks not brokers. Robinhood is contributing to the price stagnation right now (a price freeze in my mind) by putting restrictions on how much you can buy yet again.

Since my last comments got buried, I figured I’d do my autists who haven’t gone full qanon a favor and paint you the bigger picture of how this shit will go down. It’s long so strap in kiddos. 


The squeeze is over. It’s happened. It happened on Wednesday into Thursday when it hit the intraday high of 483. This squeeze was when we fucked over Melvin to the tune of 50% of their portfolio who were shorting at a fucking ridiculous $3 entry. We did it. We won. 


Now where you retards went wrong is you failed to realize that there was a whole new flood of shorts at $400. This is why short interest (more on short interest later) stayed at roughly 60m shares short which is where you get your divine 110% short number. 


This is when all hell broke loose and wall st. did their usual fuck the retails and the poors tactic, and guess what. It worked. It went from intraday highs of $483 down into the 200s for a lot of Thursday and Friday. THIS IS WHEN THEY COVERED. Let’s get one thing straight. Wsb’s greatest advantage AND weakness is diamond handing. You either hold to become DFV or you hold to become the guy who lost 500k on luckin coffee. HFs don’t give a shit about diamond handing. They drool over .001% alpha on volume trading so no fucking shit they’re going to cover from 400 to 200. 


So now the short interest sits at roughly 50%, but probably closer to 30% when you take into account various hedges. It means these new shorts fucked you all to the tune of over 6b when they covered. Daily interest rates are a fucking joke when they’ve made their profits already. The remaining shares short are their yolos. 


Now here’s where you retards really fucked up. You keep expecting the same short squeeze potential when we first squoze. That pressure was legitimate as Melvin was sitting on shorts initiated at $3. Every move upwards fucked them hard. Anyone who’s held ITM options knows the joy of high delta. But you retards don’t realize that these new shorts are initiated at $400. HOW THE FUCK IS RETAIL GOING TO PUSH THIS TO 400 WITHOUT A SQUEEZE? The only reason it got there was the squeeze from the $3 short. Diamond handing at these levels does fucking zero. You fucks need to purchase at 400 - then push beyond that to 500-600 to put any sort of pressure on these new shorts. Diamond handing does literally NOTHING because they’re under no pressure besides laughable interest rates. 


In a way, it’s actually beautiful. You’re all holding OTM options with a delta of .005 with zero catalysts and zero hope for a squeeze. It’s wsb at its finest. At this point, aside from the automated ladder attacks, you’re all just bidding against each other and there’s not enough momentum to turn the tide. One last time for you dense motherfuckers out there - diamond handing does not pressure these new shorts. You need to buy to $350+ and then buy again at those levels. Buying dips does jack shit. 


Now, a quick primer on short interest. The only reliable info on short interest is the SEC report that comes out every 15 days. There are a stupid number of outlets reporting 15 day old (all melvin) figures. Which brings us to the slimy fucks at S3. Yes they have citron-like marketing, but it’s the only publicly available model for short interest. They showed that during wed/thurs, short interest was still at 110%. The problem was that you yards thought it was Melvin instead of the new shorts. They then updated again to show that short interest was now down to 50% levels or 30% if you take into the hedges I mentioned earlier. You can reeeeee all you want, and accuse them of being shills, but just take a look at this price action. Is it possible they’re lying out of their teeth? Sure. But It’s pretty fucking clear what is taking place so just fucking Occam’s razor it you tards. You’re all bagholding for “ideals” and “justice”. If you all want to sacrifice your money to these vampire fucks out of your unwavering sense of virtue, be my guest. Just post some loss porn for the rest of us.

With the Democratic sweep, impending national cannabis legalization turbocharges this already sexy investment. More legal states = more cannabis retailers to list on Weedmaps = more revenue. Even better? I see a future where consumers buy their cannabis from local retailers in their state online via Weedmaps. The company is already profitable and has high brand equity with those who smoke the ganja. I posted about this SPAC around two months ago at $14 and it has since reached a peak of $26. At $20 where it currently stands, this a great time to jump in before the merge/ticker switches to $WEED. I see this stock reaching $50 before this Summer.

Aphria (**$APHA**) and Tilray (**$TLRY**) are merging to create the world’s biggest cannabis company. Close to 1B (874M to be exact) in annualized revenues which will only grow.

Anyways the merger states:

“Under the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Aphria (the “Aphria Shareholders”) **will receive 0.8381 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of Tilray for each Aphria common share** (each, an “Aphria Share”), while holders of Tilray shares (the “Tilray Stockholders”) will continue to hold their Tilray shares (the “Tilray Shares”) with no adjustment to their holdings. Upon the completion of the Arrangement, Aphria Shareholders will own approximately 62 percent of the outstanding Tilray Shares.” [Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201216005519/en/Aphria-and-Tilray-Combine-to-Create-Largest-Global-Cannabis-Company-With-Pro-Forma-Revenue-of-C874-Million-US685-Million)

This means Aphria should be trading at **.8381** of Tilray’s share price. Tilray is at $22.50 x .8381 = **$18.86**. Aphria should be trading at **$18.86**, yet it’s only at **$13.95.** That’s a whopping **34%** difference.

Considering Aphria is the stronger company and controls 62% of the combined company, it’s very rare for it to be trading so far away from the merger ratio. I’ve never seen a merger discrepancy like this before. If anything, Aphria should have the premium. Also, Tilray has high short interest so I doubt it will dip as shorts have to cover, it's most likely Aphria should catch up to Tilray's level.

**Aphria/Tilray vs. CGC**

Now let’s compare Aphria/Tilray to Canopy Growth. Canopy did 135M revenue last quarter which is approximately 540M annualized revenue along with a 96M net loss and a whopping adj. EBITDA loss of negative 85M. Furthermore, Canopy has -190M free cash flow, ([Source](https://www.canopygrowth.com/investors/news-releases/canopy-growth-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-2021-financial-results/))

Aphria did 160.5M revenue with Adj EBITDA of 12.6M. This will only increase as their next financials will have SweetWater Brewing on them. [Source](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/aphria-inc-announces-record-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2021-results-890905217.html)

Aphria expected to potentially be cash flow positive either this Q or next. “And we continue to work to be free cash flow positive in Q3, all subject to the intensity of COVID-19 restrictions in the markets where we operate. “

Canopy is valued at **15.8B USD**. Aphria/Tilray will be close to 1B annualized revenue, is EBITDA positive, and is valued at only 4.4 and 2.9B respectively. Not necessarily hating on CGC, the backing from Constellation is definitely solid, but when comparing the two Aphria should be valued higher.

Aphria leads Canada in market share ahead of CGC:  [Source](https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235)

Aphria also has a solid presence in the United States thanks to their EBITDA positive craft beer company, SweetWater who sells [cannabis-inspired beer](https://www.sweetwaterbrew.com/brews/420-strain-g13-ipa/).

Lastly, the U.S gov could act on some sort of cannabis legislature soon:

**TL;DR:** Aphria should be trading 34**% higher** than its current SP due to the .8381 merger ratio with Tilray.

If you are interested in cannabis, I believe there is much better value in Aphria/Tilray compared to CGC.

First – Monke Diamond Hands Banana Rocket Rocket Rocket Rocket Moon

**This is not financial advice. This is speculation based on my limited understanding of SEC rules and documents. Sources linked. Please read edits 2 & 3.**

**TLDR**: My opinion is that Shorts will continue to drive the price down with ladders and try to break the chain of consecutive days where GME is listed as a threshold security. **They need at least 1 non-Failure To Deliver day before EoD Thursday. If they get even 1 day without aggregate Failure To Deliver then the entire 13 consecutive day count restarts. They need 5 consecutive days without aggregate Failure To Deliver to have GME fully removed as a threshold security. Selling is good for them and bad for diamond hands. Ape strong together. Diamond Hands get the Rocket Ship.** No idea if achieving 13 consecutive days will force the squeeze or not.

My opinion is that Shorts don’t plan to cover their position by Tuesday. They don’t have to. Instead, they will drive the price down for as many days as possible and attempt to break the chain of consecutive settlement (read: business) days where they fail to deliver. GME has been listed as a **threshold security** (see below) for 10 consecutive business days (please check my math. I had to count on my fingers). Shorts need to break that chain before it reaches **13 consecutive business days**. “Participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in ‘threshold securities’ if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.” \[SEC Rule 204\] (link below)

**If diamond handed monke can HOLD strong and reach 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, then the shorts will have to cover the position by buying GME shares or equivalent shares of like kind and quantity. If maths good, that puts Thursday Feb 4th as day #13. Ape hold strong.**

We've seen confusion, fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding what happened Monday Feb 1st. Remember that FUD is one of their greatest weapons against retail investors right now. They want to use it to divide retail and to convince people to sell based on emotion. I’M NOT FUCKING SELLING!

Warning: I am not a financial professional or a financial advisor. I read at a grade-3 level. This is not financial advice.

\*Read below here if you can or care.

1. Why no squeeze Monday after $320+ close on Friday?

Shorts weren’t required to cover their positions on Monday. I think that they have T+2 (time of close + 2 business days) to cover their position. If true, this means they have until EoD Tuesday to cover. After that, they will have failed to deliver on the security. That isn’t good for them, but it isn’t as bad as it sounds. Failure to deliver is like a steppingstone in the process. After 5 consecutive business days with Failure To Deliver, the stock is listed as a security threshold. NYSE Threshold Securities can be checked here [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

It takes 13 consecutive days being listed as a security threshold before the positions must be closed (If the rules still apply to them).

So, instead of covering, shorts spent the day driving the price down to a more favorable position for them. They may have scared away some paper hands along the way too.

2. How does that help the shorts?

Lower price means it costs less to cover and the Shorts have more room to negotiate with other funds. A cheaper darkpool buyout is good for them. If they can lower it enough, covering becomes a non-issue compared to a full on squeeze.

Shorts want to avoid days where GME fails to deliver and they want to create non-Failure To Deliver days to break the chain of consecutive failures to deliver. This is easier for them if the price is lower.

3. So squeeze on Tuesday/Wednesday right?

I don’t think the squeeze happens Tuesday or Wednesday. I think the shorts are setting up the next part of their plan. I think if the squeeze happens this week, it happens because the shorts reach 13 consecutive days where they fail to deliver. This means diamond hands and limiting the number of cheap shares that shorts can buy after ladder attacks aka diamond hands.

4. We’ve heard this before. So what?

I agree with the idea that adding RC & friends to the board had a positive influence on the stock price. I don’t think that was the only thing happening when we saw price rise during mid-January. Going back to the idea of 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, we can refer to our NYSE tracker [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

Starting at the beginning of the year, we see that Jan 4th is the first day GME is marked as a threshold security. It stays listed as a threshold security through Jan 15th. Remember we don’t count weekends so the count resumes January 18th. On the 18th, it falls off the list for the day and comes back on January 19th. Without this single day drop-off, the 13-day countdown would have ended at EoD Wednesday Jan 20th. I believe that the price jump we saw can be partially attributed to the fact that shorts NEEDED to avoid another Failure To Deliver or they would risk being uncovered. That was pre-spike. Now they are in a similar position closing in on the 13th consecutive day. They will do whatever they can to avoid that 13th consecutive day because that means they will avoid having their record books searched through by someone outside their firm/fund.

**Threshold Securities**

Def: Threshold Securities are equity securities that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for

· Five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency; and

· Totaling 10,000 shares or more; and

· Equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer’s total shares outstanding.

If you see any mistakes or if I missed something, let me know. Looking to keep this as accurate and up to date as possible.

Conclusion: Hold banana with diamond hands to board the rocket ship

Edit 2: It has been brought to my attention that I didn't count Jan. 18th as a holiday when checking the threshold securities list. Going back to check my work now and will mark any edits that are made. Information will not be removed, but I will do my best to address any mistakes I have made. Thank you for your help.

&#x200B;

Edit 3: Dec. 25th, Jan. 1st, and Jan 18th were all holidays and NYSE was closed. Going back we see Dec. 8th has GME listed as a security threshold. It was correctly pointed out ( u/AlexGu812 ) that this brings us to 37 consecutive days. I don't know enough about this stuff to confidently say what that means. I think it may have to do with the close-out requirements or it could be a sign of bad faith actions.   ""The requirement to close out fail to deliver positions in threshold securities that remain for thirteen consecutive settlement days does not apply to any positions that were established prior to the security becoming a threshold security"" <-- This may explain why we haven't seen mass closeouts despite passing the 13 day threshold.

I've posted on here a couple times before, I'm just interested in continuing to exchange quality plays to keep our tendies flowing. If you have any doubts, check out my last DD on $SRNE from a few weeks ago:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky63a8/srne\_to\_the\_moon\_again/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky63a8/srne_to_the_moon_again/)

Now, I know everyone is kinda busy right now with GME, AMC, BB, and the rest. However, if you do happen to be out of those names (or missed the ride and never got in), I have another stock that I would like to bring to your collective attention. Corsair Gaming (CRSR).

I've seen DD about this stock on here before, but it's been a little while and I feel like it deserves some more hype. For those who are not familiar, Corsair makes keyboards, headsets, and other peripherals for use in PC gaming and livestreaming, which is a rapidly growing market, especially in the wake of COVID-19 lockdowns.

Corsair IPO'd back in September, and they crushed their Q3 earnings report. Their quarterly revenue increased 60% year-over-year, and their net income was up **384%.**  They also released full-year guidance, and they expect to finish the year with $1.6B in revenue and $187M in EBITDA. These are huge numbers when you consider their market cap is only $3.4B! At this revenue level, they would only be trading 2X sales, which is not high at all considering the current market and the high-growth industry they operate in. It's also possible that they see a revenue boost due to the recent console cycle. This brought increased attention to gaming equipment, and generated a demand that other major players couldn't keep up with. If you wanted to buy the new PS5 at any point since it was released in November, odds are that you couldn't. I don't really have any data to back this point up, but in my personal opinion, that factor could have lead more people to invest in computer gaming in order to play the new next-gen games that were released with the new consoles.

Holiday shopping season + console cycle + low supply of competing hardware could equal a blowout quarterly report.

After the recent events with GameStop, I am surprised that this stock isn't getting more hype because its situation should be right up this sub's alley. Corsair has about 90 million shares outstanding, but most of those are owned by company insiders until the lockup period expires at the end of this month. Right now, the float is only 25 million shares, and half of that float is owned by institutions and another 2 million of those shares are sold short.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crsr/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crsr/institutional-holdings)

In other words, there are only about 10-15M shares available to freely trade on a daily basis. This low float means that this stock can be easily manipulated by the big players, but this scarcity also means that in the event of good news, this stock could fly. Even if enough people try to pile in before earnings, the price could jump $5-$10 like it did last Wednesday. 

Corsair is going to report their Q4 earnings on February 9th, and I think that leading into that report, they could move back into the $40 range. After their last earnings they ran from $21-$51, so another move over $50 is not out of the question. I still haven't figured out options, so I have no idea what strike price or expiration date you should be looking at, if any. I'm playing this the only way I know how, accumulating some shares while it's under $40 and holding 'till next week.

TLDR: High-growth gaming stock could crush earnings next Tuesday. Low float = high volatility, so any good news could shoot it up.

This is **NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**, please do your own research before entering into a trade. Simply presenting a trade that I’m excited about, and I’d love some feedback.

Now I may be a smooth-brained autist but it seems that TTCF is actually quite different from BYND and has a niche in that it offers other popular food shit like stuff with cauliflower flour substitutes as well as plant-based meat. Also, in case you didn’t know, Beyond Meat’s ingredients lists are longer than your wife’s boyfriend’s dick, and health-conscious people don’t like that. TTCF pushes a more “farm to table” notion that makes its products seem closer to the source, so it also differentiates itself from BYND that way. 

Last quarter's net income was shitty compared to previous quarters (loss of 3.1M for Sept 2020 compared to 916K and 4.88M for June and March 2020 respectively). They said that the major loss last quarter was due to a “non-recurring” expense, which is not unexpected considering these plant-based companies have a lot of innovative shit to deal with in order to scale and preserve food made from natural ingredients that naturally go bad. 

Another major thing to consider is their revenue last quarter compared to BYND: DESPITE THE FACT THAT TTCF HAS NEARLY 1/10 THE MARKET CAP OF BYND (1.65B compared to \~11B ), ITS REVENUE LAST QUARTER WAS ONLY ½ THAT OF BYND (41M compared to 94.44M). 

Also, given that unlike BYND the big institutions haven’t jumped on board for this one yet, there is solid room for growth. Their earnings will be at the end of the month or at the very beginning of March. The last earnings report moved the price up big time despite net loss and this upcoming one likely will too.

I hate to say it, but I think the jig is up and I'll show you my reasoning. In this document:

1. Melvin was telling the truth about covering their entire short position last week (.
2. Why the GME chart doesn't match the VW chart
3. If all the shorts have covered, then why are there no shares available to short?

# 1. Melvin Capital DID close their shorts last Monday

[Melvin Capital announced last Tuesday they closed their short positions](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/hedge-fund-targeted-by-reddit-board-melvin-capital-closed-out-of-gamestop-short-position-tuesday.html). There is more than enough evidence they accomplished this last Monday.

First, check out GME price action and volume last Monday (1/25). I want you to pay close attention to the period between 10am and 11am.

[GME price action and volume on 1\/25](https://preview.redd.it/vn98pna6p3f61.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=73b9000a233bd0a522fa6d25c68ea4025bbecc92)

Now take a [Look at Melvin Capital's last reported holdings](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link). From what I can tell, it looks like Melvin liquidated a percentage of their positions across the board. I chose to sort this chart by % Ownership with the thinking that selling a stock for which you have high ownership is sort of a reverse squeeze (you create a large amount of float in comparison).

For their top owned holding (8.7% of shares owned)  **L Brands** (ticker LB), notice the price action on 1/25. They liquidated their holdings from \~10am-11am, which coincides directly with the jump in GME price.

[LB Brands price and volume action on 1\/25](https://preview.redd.it/e99gwq6io3f61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e3b9f78b6892dfadf936a087398917f9d1865e0)

Furthermore, we can get a very rough estimate at how much Melvin raised to cover their GME shorts. From [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/LB:NYSE) we can see LB volume on 1/25 was 17M shares. If we look across the previous 4 Mondays, the average volume on a Monday is <3M shares. It's likely that when Melvin offloaded their shares, they caused stop losses to trigger and unintentionally caused others to sell their shares, but if we assume Melvin raised the cash from all the sales, they made \~$200M from LB sales alone.

Here's another holding (7.2% Ownership) American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) with the same price and volume action. The volume on 1/25 was 13M vs 3-5M for previous Mondays. Using the same napkin math as above, we get \~$200M netted above average volume.

Extrapolating this across their 119 holdings they could easily have raised the capital required to close at least most of their GME position. Although there is no data on their short position, assuming it was 10x their reported position in GME puts (50M), they could have easily covered the position in trading volume that day (178M)

[American Eagle Outfitters price and volume action for 1\/25](https://preview.redd.it/h75olhmgr3f61.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=0390813919218e2cd528b6737df9bf576f00a22f)

Although I checked for quite a few of their holdings and saw the same pattern, I'm a retard when it comes to making these graphs and I'll leave it as an exercise to further validate.

# 2. Why isn't GME going to rebound like VW?

Most of you have likely seen the below graph used to describe the VW squeeze in 2008. One of the most notable parts about the graph is the massive drop in VW price right before the squeeze - why did that happen?

[Volkswagen AG share price during 2008 short squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/kgnshh3os3f61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdfcad33bff94490b2b0301e13befa602b854673)

[This is a great article I found gives a mostly objective view on the VW short squeeze](https://www.ft.com/content/0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39a26) and I think /u/notasabretooth gives a good explanation [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l624yc/why_did_vw_dip_before_the_big_squeeze_in_08/gkxu360?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) The great financial crisis crashed markets globally and VW followed suite - in fact, when VW stock began to fall, short sellers doubled down on their bets as VW was not in great financial shape which caused the very noticeable down spike in the graph above. Porsche had other plans, however, and announced to the world that it had stealthily accumulated shares and now \~90% of VW stock was out of circulation. This caused the sharp uptick and I would point out that there are no further rebounds following the initial squeeze.

Although GME still has many shorts, many of these shorts are likely not the ones that started before the squeeze and instead sold near the top with a much better cost basis. In fact, one of my subscribed newsletters sent out the below sage advice 4 days ago - and if I was smarter I would have listened :)

>""GME is one of the greatest shorts of all time. If you can get the borrow… short it he told me. ""

# 3. If all the major shorts have covered, then why are there no shares available to short?

This was another thing that had not been sitting well with me. If there are no shares available to short sell, then how has the number of shorts decreased? 

First, touching on above - the current short sellers likely have a much higher cost basis and are unlikely to be squeezed like those caught in the initial squeeze. 

Second, it's not clear how shares are made available for borrowing. I found [this very informative article](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investor-education/can-my-broker-lend-out-my-shares-to-short-sellers-without-asking/article32393872/) which gives the meaningful lines of text

>If you want to short sell a stock, your broker needs to call his or her firm's loan desk to see if the shares are available for lending... If the firm does not own it in their own portfolio they have to attempt to borrow the stock from other firms.  As a client of a firm, **your shares cannot be lent out to someone who is looking to short sell**. Shares are held in trust for each client and are kept on separate books. 

If this is true, then the GME squeeze was likely a victim of its own success. By retail investors buying all the stocks, we prevented a continuous short squeeze by evaporating the supply of shortable shares."|2021-02-02 20:42:41.183949|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_204247.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'VW', 'DID', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'L', 'GME', 'LB', 'GME', 'LB', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'LB', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'VW', 'VW', 'VW', 'AG', 'I', 'VW', 'I', 'VW', 'VW', 'VW', 'VW', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'LB', 'GME', 'LB', 'LB', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Sources in comments.

tl;dr: Given current situation and positive changes implemented by the management team I see $*MACE* having a great future (personal safety and security industry is projected to reach USD 5,5kkk by the end of 2025, registering annual CAGR of 11.00%. Growth is fueled by political changes, worsening climate situation and changes in human behavior). This is one is to hold for long time. I’m not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice.

Longer Version

My investment strategy is finding a stock that will perform well in medium/long term. I usually try to take profits or cut losses within one year, so look for companies that should benefit from what is happening around the world (be it Covid, civil unrests, green revolution, semiconductors scarcity). Today I’ll share my opinion about personal safety and security industry in light of current events.

Guns in USA – Democrats have control, RNA went bankrupt, society at large agrees on stricter gun laws. In near future this might result in policy changes that makes it more difficult for people to get lethal weapons as means of self defense. However, a need for self defense is not going away any time soon and here’s why:

· We have seen that during the recent civil unrest weapons and ammunitions sales skyrocketed. I think that fundamental issues which fueled these events are not going away anytime soon. Portland still rumbling in protests and Q is searching for space lasers… People will want to protect themselves – pepper spray or stun gun is better than nothing if gun laws change.

· Covid lockdowns and restrictions pushed people to spend more alone in the nature. You know who else is in the nature? Bears! Demand in animal deterrent sprays should increase.

· All the talks about defunding and rebuilding police. Sounds like there is a room to expand use of non-lethal weapons in most situations.

· Dating world. Online dating accounts for most dates out there and that introduces risk of meeting some creepy person. Demand for personal safety alarms should increase. Good LinkedIn post on this: **Source 1**

· Climate change creates a lot of wealth disparity that fuels societal disorder. Throw on top of that explosive mix of economical, Covid, political issues and in my opinion what we are seeing now around the world is just the beginning of new normal. Critical mass of anger is achieved and this won’t go down so smoothly. When there’s anger on the streets people look to defend themselves.

In my opinion all of these are external catalysts for personal safety industry. Now about $*MACE*, one of the old timers in this industry.

**Company**: Mace Security International, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells personal defense and security products to retailers, distributors, and individual consumers worldwide. Brands: Mace, Tornado, Vigilant and Take Down. The company distributes and supports its branded products and services through mass market retailers, wholesale distributors, independent dealers, e-commerce channels, and installation service providers. Headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. [https://www.mace.com/](https://www.mace.com/)

**History:** Founded in 1965, but it looks like company has lost its way at some point – $*MACE* had carwashes as their line of business up till 2013 (**Source 2**). Old management team neglected company’s online presence, so brand and sales suffered. Not much else to say here.

**Now**: new management team since 2019. Has been working on changes and got struck with Covid shenanigans, but is adapting quickly to a current environment. Recognizes missed online opportunities and now is focusing on online sales. Q3 increase in online sales compared to Q2 is in triple digits (meaning 100%+) (**Source 3**, **Source 4**)

Check out their amazon shop – has lots of positive reviews.

When searching for ‘best pepper spray’, ‘best animal deterrent’ I find articles, posts with Mace products. That leads me to think that online exposure has improved a lot and there will be large number of people getting same results when looking for self-defense products.

**Latest Financial Results**: Q3 2020

Net sales increased $2,310,000 or 94% versus prior year, primarily driven by organic growth, addition of new customers both in retail and e-commerce segments and new product line extensions at retailers.  
Gross profit for the third quarter increased by $1,016,000 or 108% over the same period in the prior year, driven primarily by increased sales volume, labor efficiencies, and higher margin digital sales.  
SG&A expenses increased by $177,000 to $1,183,000 for the quarter, or 25% of net sales, driven primarily by higher variable sales commissions and performance-related incentives. Net income increased by $843,000.  
Cash and cash equivalents increased to $549,000 as of September 30, 2020, an increase of $242,000 over the $307,000 on hand on December 31, 2019. Working capital increased by $1,860,000 compared to December 31, 2019. The company paid off its loan in the amount of $600,000 on September 30, 2020.  
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $889,000 (1.4 cents per share on an undiluted basis for the quarter).  
From earnings call transcript: **Source 5** (I recommend to go through it – gives nice outlook on new management team results and their future plans)

**Recent Catalyst**: Protest in US and increased demand in personal defense products, 94% revenue increase in Q3 vs last year, ‘2021 OTCQX Best 50‘ award (**Source 6**), one-year $2.0 million Revolving Credit Agreement with Fifth Third Bank (meaning cash on tap: **Source 7**)

**Upcoming $*****MACE*** **Catalysts**: New product launch in Q1 2021 (mentioned in call transcript above), FY 2020 results (which due to all recent political tensions should show even better results than those reported for Q2 and Q3)

**Upcoming Industry Catalysts**: Personal safety and security industry is projected to reach USD 5,5kkk by the end of 2025, registering annual CAGR of 11.00%:

$*MACE* just touched 5 months bottom resistance point. In January after Capitol riots stock soared due to the whole industry (guns, ammo, self-defense) gains. I think that end of the month drop-off is due to people taking gains from speculation on January events.

Summary: I don’t expect here SPAC or pharma level returns, but steady growth instead. Would like to see $*MACE* trade in $1.5-$2 by Q3 and consolidate there by the end of year. It also used to pay dividends, but that has stopped in 2011. Who know maybe good results will reward investors with some dividends? :)

My position: 3.3k shares at $0.412

All of us have been feeling the ups and downs of this ride and, to be honest, don't forget where it all started and how far we've come. And by 'we' I mean the people who like this stock.

Big hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time).

But, just in time of Mark's Cuban AMA, I will spoil the message in his own words:

«If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.»

This is the message, this is what I want to say to every single of you retards who are in doubt. It's not all fun and games. Some suits are fighting not to lose billions. We, the people, are disrupting the market. You thought it would be easy?

They are doing everything they can to get those shares in your pocket, that's the only way to cover their naked ass. When people have been saying to **HOLD** this is precisely what they fucking meant. **TO FUCKING HOLD**. **THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD. NO, IF YOU WANT THOSE FUCKING TENDIES YOU CAN'T LET SOME WALL STREET CORRUPT TRASH PARASITE TO COME AND TAKE IT FROM YOUR HANDS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT HOLDING THEIR PANTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL AFRAID AND SELL. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD - AND ARE - FUCKING DESPERATE.**

You genuinely think that if they weren't scared all of this circus would've happen?

Hold your shares, and, if you can, buy some more. Volume is low, price is in discount. We still have the cheese in our hands. Plus (and correct me if I'm wrong because, you know, I'm a retard as well) they still have contracts to cover. I'm confident we might see the price to rise again today. But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, **patience is key.** Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): ***«Patience. Disruption is never easy or straight line».***

Guys, one last word: this is the epic journey people have been speaking for months. It's starting to spike (remember VW chart, i.e.). Today we are experiencing one of their last attempts to buy shares from the ones who panicked. This is why people keep yelling to **HOLD!** This is why you should not invest with money you might need, because you don't know how much time you'll have to **HOLD!** This is why you have to know your risk tolerance, to **FUCKING KEEP HOLDING**.

**JUST TAKE A LOOK TO THE MESIAH IT SELF, DO YOU SEE DEEP FUCKING VALUE SELLING?**

MAN UP BOYS, AND KEEP HOLDING THE FUCKING LINE

GME Is currently valued at 7.94Bn USD

The gaming industry was valued at 151Bn in 2019 according to grand view research. 

GME made 6.3 Bn in revenue last year with no new consoles to sell. 

Now let’s compare this to Chewy. (You all know about Ryan Cohen). 

Chewy is currently worth 41.76Bn!!!!

The pet care market according to the same analyst is about 150.72Bn in 2019. (Was 131 in 2016 with a CAGR at 4.6%)

Chewy had a revenue of 6Bn last year. 

So what does this mean?????????

GME is fairly valued at 41Bn if not more. 

That translates to 591.92$ a share. 


This is not financial advice yadayada I is smooth brains I just like the stock.

I don't know what the fuck I'm doing but here's my Ding Dong:

* ICLN debuted in 2008 with the highest price of 60$/share during the time of oil fear but quickly got dumped back down over several years. The stock is currently trading at around 30$, only half from the peak.

[ICLN Timeline](https://preview.redd.it/5g9sw9hf14f61.png?width=1224&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ec7ca2c10425c1a5de851872324fa0fe898c8e6)

* **But here's the catch**. Back in 2008, the renewable energy industry was literal trash. The technologies at the time were expensive and inefficient. Miniscule progress was made even with huge subsidies from many countries. Fast forward 12+ years and with improvement in technologies, prices for renewable energy have been significantly reduced -> more adoptions from the average households.

* Many companies in the industry are quickly growing in size and turning profitable. Amongst ICLN's holdings, there are: Enphase Energy $ENPH (which doubled in size from 2018-2019), Verbund AG (largest hydropower provider in Austria), big solar players like First Solar $FSLR, SolarEdge $SEDG, Sunrun $RUN, and some other foreign companies.

* Biden's Green Energy policies include plans to move the United States to 100% clean energy by 2050, boost jobs in the renewable energy industry, and up to $5 TRILLION incentives over the next 10 years. [https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/](https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/)
* Search results for 'clean energy' on the rise worldwide according to Google Trend.

* Premiums still cheap as fuck with 2023 call options only around $500-800$.

I will be holding this position for at least a year and will be adding more on major dips. I will also update this position monthly to the sub. Join me on this crusade for a brighter, greener, and richer future. This shit literally can't go tits up.

I eat yellow snow. Proceed at your own risk. 

***Of course hold GME*** but it's always a good idea to stay aware of other things that are going on.\*

I am a simple man. I will make a simple case for EXPI. 

1- If any industry is primed for disruption it is real estate brokerages. Information is becoming more and more available. Who the fuck wants to keep paying 6% commission so some college drop out can unlock a door and read some info off of a sheet? Nobody. Real estate agents can go get in the go fuck yourself line right behind the investment firms. We don't need them anymore. It's not 1985 anymore. 

2- Lets look at EXPI and how it's financials compare to two of its peers. Redfin and Zillow.

# Market Caps

Expi- 8.4b

RDFN- 8.2b

Z- 34b

# Net income

Expi- Profitable

RDFN- Not profitable

Z- Not profitable

# Revenue

RDFN's has half the revenue of EXPI

Z has slightly less then double the revenue of expi

# Simpleton's Math

Redfin has half the revenue and is not profitable and yet it has the same market cap as expi.

Z has 4x expi's market cap but only 2x the revenue. And its not profitable.

Even a dumbass like me can see that expi is trading way below the value of it's peers. A fair market cap would be around 16b which would put the stock price around $240. It's currently trading at $120

Here's my shitty DD, take it with a ton of salt cause I actually, truly have no idea what I'm talking about

&#x200B;

**Thesis:** 

This Friday and next Monday/Tues is going to experience the drop of all drops for GME due to expiring options being HEAVILY skewed towards puts

&#x200B;

Looking at the yahoo options chain ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME&straddle=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME&straddle=true)) and we end the week around the current price (say, $107):

&#x200B;

Total calls expiring ITM (strike price <= 105) : 16,337

Total puts expiring ITM (strike price >= 110) : 25,797

Net difference : 9460 more put contracts expire ITM, leading to an added **946,000 shares worth of selling pressure** 

On top of this selling pressure, similar to the gamma squeeze we saw on the way up with MMs buying shares as prices increase to cover the calls they wrote, **they will be selling shares as prices drop** to cover/hedge puts they wrote which are now ITM

&#x200B;

I have no idea if this makes sense

I'm writing this to talk about GME objectively, not that ""to the moon""  or ""10k isn't a meme"" bullshit or some stupid misplaced crusade against wall street. I'm here to make money.

Right now GME has $586M in CACE ($140M of which is restricted so really $446M to do whatever they want with). Their assets have shrunk most notably from writing down almost $2 BILLION in goodwill over the last couple years. Right now the company has ZERO in goodwill, basically saying it's brand is worthless. I disagree with this after the hype WSB has created for this company. On the liability side, as of Q320, they have $224M and $216M in s-t and l-t debt, respectively, for total debt of $450M.

**GME PLEASE ISSUE STOCK.**

I know it will dilute the shit out of SHs and drop the price but I think it would be a huge buying opportunity. The fact that they haven't already is incomprehensible and arguably negligent. They could've issued 4-5M shares when this thing was over $300 at $200-250/sh and brought in $1B cash. But that's irrelevant now. What they could do is still issue stock, I'm not sure what price they could get for it but I'd be a buyer. Let's say they issue 5M shares at $100/sh, that's $500M cash... $500M would be HUGE in transforming the business. Up that to 10M shares and they bring in $1B. I think $1B is > than $500M but I'm wetahded.

So I titled this ""WSB POTENTIAL FOR ACTIVISM IN GME?"" because collectively we own a shitload of shares. Could we not push for the company to issue stock here? Could we not send a letter to GME like HFs do but with **🚀**🦍🌈🐻💎🙌🏽.

They could use $250M to pay down debt and the other half to really catalyze the transformation.

Video gaming is a growth industry and yes, brick and mortar is slowing dying, but as DFV said in his original thesis, that's a long way off.

GME needs to use the hype that WSB CULTIVATED for its brand and capitalize on it. The company couldn't have asked for a better xmas present than what's happening now. People are buying fucking billboards for GME. The company could be to gaming, what Chewy (a >$40B market cap) is to the pet industry. And clearly Ryan Cohen feels this way, too. GME needs to entrench itself into the gamer lifestyle and I really think raising funds now would accelerate this.

**Financials**

Right now I'm estimating GME will make $5B in revenues in 2020, so we're trading at 1.4x depressed revenues. For comparison CHWY trades at \~6x revenue, per yahoo finance. This is a company that made >$8B in 2018 and 2017.

They recently reported holiday sales (Nov and Dec) of $1.7B, down 1.9% yoy with 11% less stores open. SSS comps +4.8% yoy. But here's the most positive, digital sales were +309% yoy, and $1.35B ytd. As digital sales grow, this should help alleviate SG&A expenses which have historically crushed profitability. In 2017, 2018, and 2019 SG&A was $2B, and for 2020 it's looking like it'll be \~$1.4-1.5B.

**Valuation**

This is a very basic back-of-envelope calculation. But if GME can return to \~$8B in revenues (which is entirely possible and reasonable IF they can execute). And maintains historic GM's of \~30%, we get $2.4B in gross profit. And if digital sales continue to make up a larger chunks of revenues and they close redundant stores, they should be able to keep that SG&A expense under $2B. Let's say they can get it to $1.6B, which is about $100-150M above what SG&A will probably be this year (accounting for store reopenings).

So $8B revenues, 30% GM, $2.4B gross profit, $1.6B SG&A = $800M in operating income.

Assuming \~30% tax rate => $560M in net income.

If this plays out, we're currently trading at \~12.9x ($7.2B/$560M) what could be a reasonable net income # in the next couple years. My point is that GME might not be as overvalued as people think...

Anyways, please call me out on any bullshit in my thinking/logic."|2021-02-02 17:09:36.920627|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170942.csv|DueDiligence|['WSB', 'NTIAL', 'FOR', 'IVISM', 'IN', 'GME']|['GME']|['I', 'GME', 'B', 'GME', 'GME', 'M', 'CACE', 'M', 'M', 'LLION', 'ZERO', 'I', 'WSB', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'GME', 'LEASE', 'ISSUE', 'STOCK', 'I', 'I', 'M', 'B', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'HUGE', 'M', 'B', 'I', 'B', 'M', 'I', 'WSB', 'NTIAL', 'FOR', 'IVISM', 'IN', 'GME', 'GME', 'M', 'DFV', 'GME', 'WSB', 'VATED', 'GME', 'B', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'B', 'CHWY', 'B', 'B', 'SSS', 'B', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'GME', 'B', 'IF', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'M', 'A', 'B', 'GM', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'M', 'M', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'SSS', 'GME', 'GM', 'GME']

I’m not a bot.

I’m holding my measly handful of shares of GME to be a part of the movement. 

I tuned into Mark Cuban’s AMA and got wood at him saying hold if you can afford to. 

That all being, if the short interest truly is 36%, what is left of the original play toward a gamma squeeze. The only reason this play was ever a play to begin with was because of the 120%+ short interest GME originally had. 

Some say the squeeze is yet to come, some say it happened last Thursday.

$GME has to connect with all who own a large enough position within the company, even if they bought the stock just because they like the stock. That shows that the shareholders are more likely to want to help $GME to grow and grow the company’s profits. 

To those waiting on the GME board making some sort of statement, this is likely why it’s not happened yet. 

I am not a financial advisor, just a recent college grad with two bachelors in Business Admin.

Edit: I remember u/potato_in_my_ass being one of the big guys with DFV at the beginning. I mayve wrote the username incorrectly. It was mentioned in an article I read a week ago or so.

Edit 2: fixed dfv’s name as I had an s at the end, and check comment about why I said potato in my ass cuz I was under impression it was a quiet version of DFV

Edit 3: this was a response to someone’s comment about me posting this as a DD and having a simple name misspelling and being under impression that the other user I mentioned being a big time diamond hand:

         This due diligence is a response to the posts and comments I’ve been reading on here in relation to people wanting to see a statement of sorts from GME’s board of directors while also those users bringing up the possibility of a stock offering by GME.

Once you become a stockholder and are able to vote on things, that info gained from such meetings and votes is what is considered to be insider information and if a stockholder sells due to such information being given to them legally, is an illegal action as it is not the true reason behind why one should buy a stock.

What is that one true reason behind buying a stock? It’s that you LIKE the stock. You LIKE the company. You LIKE that industry, and specifically that company within it.

People who buy a stock to just profit off of it in a short term, or to just profit off of the company’s bankruptcy, is a poor excuse of a human as they are wanting others to lose their jobs. Buying a piece of a company is/should only be for those who want to see the company do well, or enjoy the products and services offered by such company."|2021-02-02 17:09:36.920627|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170941.csv|DueDiligence|['$GME']|['GME']|['$GME', '$GME', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'DFV', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'DFV', 'DD', 'I', 'GME', 'LIKE', 'LIKE', 'LIKE']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Mad about what happened today and trying to recoup losses into and then some throughout the rest of the year? I might have a play for you that could 4x your current investment. I consider myself in a lot of ways to be an investor that spends a lot of time research high-growth stocks that have a clear market fit/product that will grow into the future. I was actually an early investor in NIO at $12 a share and sold around the $55 dollar mark with 4x profits. I like NIO, but I feel that the general EV market is in a bubble considering we are still years and years away from EV adoption in all cars. If you asked the EV manufacturers to supply the entire American public with EV cars and infrastructure - it would be impossible as they cannot scale and produce that rapidly. With NIO in particular - I mainly sold because I see the renewable energy stocks to have a more promising future in 2021 than EV cars since it's going to take them time to scale, and I don't expect them to repeat the same success in 2021.

Where did I put that profit? I put it right into GEVO as I believe BioFuels are the most sensible short-medium term solution for the world we live in. I am not crazy how GEVOs revenue numbers have been in the last few years, but I'm going to let that slide because of environmental/political factors that will sure to make it a major player in the future. On top of that, Biden elected the former co-founder of GEVO into his science cabinet which only increases my confidence. Right now, GEVO has $500M+ in cash on hand, zero debt, and over a billion dollars worth in potential contract value.

If you've been following the news - you would see how the big oil companies are growing concerned regarding regulations on the new administration - as even they see the writing on the wall. What I predict is, GEVO has the renewable patent technology they could license to these oil companies. Big Oil will partner with proven technologies before trying to re-invent the wheel (look at what happened with FCEL and Exxon). Big Oils conversion to clean energy is going to need to happen - and I'm expecting GEVO to land some partners soon.

I am currently holding 1600 shares at a cost average in the high 9s and feel that GEVO on the low end is $30 by end of year, and $60-70 on the high end. I think a lot of partnerships will start popping up soon and new adoptions in the green energy space by the Biden administration will cause this to really pop.

As many in the #BANG GANG have always known, $BB becoming a meme stock has been a **mixed** blessing, to say the least. to say the most, it's fucking sucked.

Look at this chart. Look at this fucking chart. I don’t need to run a regression, let’s be just as retarded as all the candle-stick reading dipshits with a Bloomberg terminal (*#Ben Graham GANG# FOREVER AND ALWAYS)* \- Look at the lines, and how they’re moving together. Try to wrinkle that smooth brain of yours for a second.

**Why THE FUCK would an (a) Endpoint / digital security company, a vidya retailer (yeah, sure they sell funko pops too now great ), a movie chain (half of you morons have 3 streaming subscriptions and last I checked you’re not allowed to watch in your underwear while getting tendie crumbs everywhere @ AMC), and some Fininsh 5(g) provider (I don’t know a fucking thing about NOK) move in tandem other than just being meme stocks on this fucking board?**

By the way - There's been a ton of great technical analysis posted on the others in $BANG. the short squeeze on GME was real and a once-in-a-lifetime catch and i respect the hell out of it (and am also a sad bagholder of a few shares). It's just that the reasons for liking each of the stocks is different.

For better or worse - There was a post, I can’t find it but somebody else can, that showed the Robinhood dashboard that basically said the three most commonly held shares in any given account was, you guessed it $BB, $AMC, and $GGME.

As you know, Mark Cuban took a break from his busy calendar of being the least retarded Sharktank (No offense Daymond John, I have a soft spot for FUBU but my wife’s boyfriend no longer lets me rock it) and touching tips with Luka Doncic to [answer some questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey_everyone_its_mark_cuban_jumping_on_to_do_an/). Somebody asked why $GME was taking a nose dive off of Mt. Everest. Per Cuban -

*Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.*

*Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.*

So. Two things re: $BB’s volatility.

# #1 Stopping buys (but allowing sales) tanked $BB, just like it tanked the other meme stocks. The tin foil apes can keep hawking about citadel etc. but the truth is likely that RObinhood is a tech-focused firm with shitty financial controls and even shittier risk management (GUH). Never ascribe to malice what is usually (and always with that shitshow of an excuse of a company) incompetence. Those dumbasses had a liquidity problem and solved it in the worst way possible. I hope their IPO fails and Vlad steps on a lego.

# #2. The current free fall of $GME / $AMC is still dragging $BB down. Why? What happens when people get margin called? Their entire account sells off some or all of a portion to satisfy the account. For those of you more discerning retards you know that the same thing happened to the hedge funds last week.

**It’s called** [**degrossing**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-30/a-reddit-army-descends-on-hedge-funds-chained-by-risk-models?sref=NJllTNWZ)**,** and is what caused the broader market to perform **inversely** to $BANG.

*BTW - It was really fantastic for me to watch my MSFT calls get fucked because of the morons of this sub. Satya Nadella daddy dicked earnings and the stock (along with the whole fucking market) was down…Live by the retard, die by the retard. But look at the bounceback this this week, when all the hedge funds looked around and said – Wait, J. Powell is still printing money like Zimbabwe and stocks only go up.*

***What do you think will happen once things calm down, the stimulus checks hit, and retail investors start looking around again for stocks they might like?***

So now what? Well, I REPEAT, **wrinkle that smooth brain of yours. What does #1 and #2 have to do with the** [actual reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4ehan/blackberry_dd/) **that #BANG GANG likes $BB?**

If you said – ""Huh, not much"" then congrats you’ve evolved slightly beyond a retarded monkey playing at a slot machine and shitting out sub-par memes.

**TLDR - $BB WENT DOWN TODAY BECAUSE OF FACTORS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO ITS STATUS AS A MEME STOCK. $BB $BANG GANG EATs WILD DAILY PRICE SWINGS FOR BREAKFAST. THE BIGGEST LESSON OF GME / AMC IS THAT RETARDS TOGETHER STRONG. ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT ENOUGH RETARDS BELIEVE, IT EVEN HAS A CHANCE TO ROCKET AGAIN IN THE SHORT TERM.**

**TLDR the TLDR - $BB #BANG GANG IS IN FOR THE LONG HAUL. WE’RE TERRAFORMING MARS, AND TAKING MATT DAMON WITH US.**

POS – balls deep in $BB shares, planning to buy more today

If you look here on [NYSE website](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse-arca/notices)

click the 'short sale restriction list' you will see a bunch of spreadsheets with stocks including GME.

Because I have a brain as smooth as an F1 car, this means that as of the 3rd of February 2021 (tomorrow),  **~~GME will no longer be under the threat of a short ladder attack~~****.**

**But why?**

**There is a naughty list for stocks that have been fucked due to shorts**

Directly quoting [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thresholdlist.asp),

A threshold list, also known as a Regulation SHO Threshold Security List, is a list of securities whose transactions failed to clear during the previous trading days. Threshold lists are published in accordance with regulations set out by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Regulators review this information as part of their efforts to detect **market manipulation**.

* A threshold list is a list of securities that failed to settle in the previous five trading days.
* They are published by various exchanges in accordance with SEC regulations.
* These settlement failures may be indicative of naked short selling, although they may also be caused by benign factors, such as administrative errors.""

Also, if you read on the official [SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#:~:text=Rule%20204%20%E2%80%93%20Close%2Dout%20Requirement,of%20like%20kind%20and%20quantity), 

"" 

* *Rule 204 – Close-out Requirement*. Rule 204 requires brokers and dealers that are participants of a registered clearing agency[\[8\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn8) to take action to close out failure to deliver positions. Closing out requires the broker or dealer to purchase or borrow securities of like kind and quantity. The participant must close out a failure to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+4. If a participant has a failure to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona fide market making activities, the participant must close out the failure to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. If the position is not closed out, the broker or dealer and any broker or dealer for which it clears transactions (for example, an introducing broker)[\[9\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn9) may not effect further short sales in that security without borrowing or entering into a bona fide agreement to borrow the security (known as the “pre-borrowing” requirement) until the broker or dealer purchases shares to close out the position and the purchase clears and settles. In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out failures to deliver in securities with large and persistent failures to deliver, referred to as “threshold securities,” if the failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.[\[10\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn10) Threshold securities are equity securities[\[11\]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn11) that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency (e.g., National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)); totaling 10,000 shares or more; and equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer's total shares outstanding. As provided in Rule 203 of Regulation SHO, threshold securities are included on a list disseminated by a self-regulatory organization (“SRO”). Although as a result of compliance with Rule 204, generally a participant’s fail to deliver positions will not remain for 13 consecutive settlement days, if, for whatever reason, a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency in a threshold security for 13 consecutive settlement days, the requirement to close-out such position under Rule 203(b)(3) remains in effect.

As a follow-up to my post yesterday about BB, I wanted to attempt to place some of your worries at ease as many of you may be having second thoughts about your investments.  A link to my post yesterday will be provided at the end.

Yes, BB is dipping . However, please keep in mind that it is not dipping as hard as GME or AMC. There are reasons for this. BB had growth potential based on recent changes and it was never meant to be part of the current madness because the short interest just wasn't there compared to others.

It is apparent that of the BANG gang, AMC and GME got more media coverage than the rest despite having \*relatively\* less news than BB.  Referring to the premise of my DD yesterday, BB is a value play and NOT a get rich quick or anything play of the sort. This is a company that is reinventing their place in the corporate world, moving from phones to software development.  My smooth brain is holding on, even if it goes back to $7 because I believe in this company to reach new highs within the next year. 

If you invested yesterday after reading about how great I said BB is, I am sorry you can't buy a new Rolex today and you will need to go to Popeyes for your chicken tendies. However, that post was not meant to imply you would be posting gains porn by the end of the week. 

What we are seeing is likely a combination of paper hands getting scared of the pullback, and a correction in the stock after an unsustainable momentous gain based on the present value of the company. As they grow into their new position and make more and more deals to get their technology in everything, the stock will likely raise with it. When will this happen? Impossible to say, but the future looks bright. 

Before the recent momentum, BB was trading around $7.43. Even after the last few red days, BB is still holding over $11.50. Sure, this isn't as great as >$25, but like other stocks that go parabolic, there is an inevitable pull back. 

TL;DR - Stop being mad at your BB losses. Paper hands are for the weak. 

(Not financial advice, I am just a regular dude)

Also before we get into this, for all the Logitech nerds on my last post, nobody cares that your mom bought you a $10 Logitech keyboard and you like the noises it makes, it doesn't change the fact that Corsair have better quality products for pretty much everything besides mice(my opinion).

&#x200B;

Ok so first things first, we all know that the gaming industry as a whole had boomed due to COVID and has had an increasing TAM for quite some time now and is projected to continue its growth. For that reason alone I'm bullish on a lot of gaming companies other than a few that I believe have way too high of a valuation.

&#x200B;

Lets start with marketing. If any of you have as poor of a social life as I since COVID started then you'd know that Corsair has been very active in social media marketing/sponsorships on Twitch. It feels like I keep seeing more and more streamers show sponsor slides of Corsair gear. This is amazing because in my personal opinion, I believe Twitch and YouTube sponsorships is easily one of the best ways to promote your products(referring to gaming products only). Just look at recent games that have all blown up, Fortnite, Apex Legends, Warzone, and Rust have all blown up due to their large presence on Twitch. Apex Legends and Rust quite literally paid streamers to play the game and look at how well that worked out for them.

&#x200B;

Next up we'll take a look at financials, don't worry I'm not going to sit here and tell you to do your full in depth fundamental analysis reasoning report but I do think we should at least pay attention to it. Even before COVID and still during COVID Corsair has increased revenues, net income, and cash flow. This just adds extra proof that its not like Corsair was a failing company before they got the boost from COVID. Another major positive would be that Corsair has increased focus around R&D which has only proven to significantly help tech companies move ahead of their competitors and acquire more market share. Just a couple companies that also focused R&D would be Tesla(all praise father Elon) and AMD. There's obviously more to the financial aspect however I'd rather not sit here and type out their entire 10-K in a reddit post.

&#x200B;

Lastly, I think with all DD you must point out the negatives as you go along. As I stated before, Logitech definitely beats Corsair when it comes to mice. However, I typed this entire post without using a mouse so who really cares about mice. Secondly, Corsair's CEO is Andy Paul. How can you put a billion dollar company in the hands of a man with two first names and to be honest, I don't know how they do it. Although that is definitely a big negative, their logo is extremely cool which I think makes up for it.

&#x200B;

Thank you for your time, now lets preheat this oven and start baking some tendies!

&#x200B;

Note: Logitech fanboys please don't attack me in the comments, I don't care about your mice, just leave me alone and go play pong or something with your amazing mouse."|2021-02-02 17:09:36.920627|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170942.csv|DueDiligence|['RSAIR', 'TO', 'THE', 'MOON']|[]|['DD', 'COVID', 'TAM', 'I', 'I', 'COVID', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'COVID', 'COVID', 'COVID', 'D', 'D', 'AMD', 'K', 'I', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'CEO', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['AMD']

More details below, based on 3 observations.

**Disclaimer: This is my DD, hence the flair.  Please do your own research. Disclosures below. This is not financial advice.**

Three observations:

1)	Elon Musk is increasingly praising a specific financial instrument on his twitter

2)	Musk needs a serious amount of silver for several of his holdings: SolarCity (owned by Tesla), SpaceX, and Tesla

3)	Musk has a history of sending out tweets that wind up changing prices of assets


Breakdown:

1) Elon Musk is hyping something on Twitter, talking about how it is on the verge of being accepted. If money goes into that thing because people anticipate a spike in value, it can't go into buying up silver metals.

Source (Elon Musk's Twitter):

2) Musk needs silver metal for many reasons: solar panels for SolarCity (owned by Tesla), solar panels for Space X satellites, electrical conductors for EVs (Tesla).  Musk wants the price of silver to stay as low as possible, since his companies will need to buy it for industrial purposes regardless. 

Sources:

SolarCity:

https://www.streetwisejournal.com/5-reasons-silver-is-gaining-in-value/  

https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/solar-driven-silver-demand-set-to-dim-as-sector-innovates-60533352

<- States that Solarcity (and others) are seeking to move from Silver to Copper, which is cheaper, but has not done yet.  Most photovoltaic cells still need silver to be built, though this may change by 2028.

SpaceX: All these satellites have 1 solar panel, and likely use silver for internal electrical components + electrical shielding.

Tesla:
https://goldsilver.com/blog/why-elon-musk-secretly-loves-silver/#:~:text=Electric%20cars%20and%20trucks%20require,management%20system%20all%20require%20silver. <-- Claiming EVs use more silver than combustion cars.

https://banyanhill.com/silver-rally-tesla-cybertruck/ <-- Same as above.

https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-01-13/The-surprising-driver-of-future-silver-demand.html <Same as above.

**So what?**
If the price of silver skyrockets, so does the cost of manufacturing solar panels (for Earth and Space) and EVs, all of which eats into $TSLA's margins, as it owns SolarCity and uses silver for electrical components (also SpaceX's). 

So Musk, in my opinion, is understandably trying to get as many impressionable retail traders over to another safe haven ASAP **so that they DON’T go into silver.**  And that's why he's pressing it so hard.
  

And I love the guy, but he does have a history of tweeting things and then prices swinging around them (#TSLA420YOLO). Silver has a lot of strong pressures to buy right now, short and long term, and **Musk knows this**, and he would prefer to avoid a major spike if possible, since his companies will need to buy silver no matter what: you can't just sub in another metal right away.


**TL;DR**: If silver goes through the roof, solar panels, satellites (panels + internal components), and  EVs become more expensive to make, all bad news for $TSLA.  Theorizing Musk is pushing another safe haven on his twitter as a distraction, hoping to divert retail funds and thus dodging a silver price retail surge from hell. 


Disclosures: I am long and currently hold positions in $PSLV, $AG, and silver mining company ETFs, $TSLA via ARKK, and 4 silver dollars my great uncle gave me when I was a kid. I also hold a small position in what Elon's pushing.

Yesterday I posted a DD on Tilray and why it was headed to the moon. Link below.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lail27/tlry_dd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

I’m returning today to inform everyone about how the $TLRY and $APHA merger happening Q2 will work. 

Based on the terms of the merger, $APHA owners will receive 83% of their $APHA shares as $TLRY stock. For all you smooth brains, this means that $APHA should be 83% of whatever $TLRY stock price is on a given day. This is currently not the case.

I have predicted that $TLRY will moon based on short interest and other DD. Link above. This means that $APHA is discounted and will follow this move. So smart money will buy $APHA to take advantage of this discount along with the impending moon of $TLRY.

Hope this helps. Don’t miss out.

First, the fundamentals should suggest that there is an imbalance of supply and demand, which could result in a major move. Second, the chart must show that the market is moving in the direction that the fundamentals suggest. Third, when news comes out, the market should act in a way that reflects the right psychological tone. For example, a bull market should shrug off bearish news and respond vigorously to bullish news.

If I am reading this correctly. Seeing the price is going down and the short volume is 50% or greater most days, it looks like they are increasing their position for sure. I believe 6pm tonight is when new official short interest data comes out.

Basically, they keep shorting we keep holding, they will have to give out eventually given the interest one way or another. I did hear on another post these may be synthetic shorts but have a timeline as well.

It might have also lost you a lot of money. Because you just participated in what can only be described as a cultural phenomenon that turned into a massive rally against hedge funds you might have forgotten, or even never knew some things.

Everybody here is retarded, so it's retarded to use it as a kickstart platform for a social movement.

Everybody is also here to make money.

So let's talk about making some money. The entire reason GME became a target to make money on this sub had jack shit to do with a short squeeze. Initially, it was because some speculation after changes in the board. The fundamentals were not as bad as the company was priced, and it had a future.

Now the price has blown out the fundamentals, so think about the future of the company. At it's current trading price it's worth about 6 billion. Is Gamestop potentially a 20 billion company? If so, you will see retracement. If so, how long will that take? Years. Is that okay with you? I can't answer that for you, but what I can say is remember this was not initially about a short squeeze. If you still believe in the original thesis, a decrease in price means average down. If you own 10 shares @ 350, getting 100 shares again at 30 reduces your cost basis to 54, and if you think it's an $100 stock, you profitted.

The exact same thing is true for BB, and AMC. If you bought any of these for an actual reason, fix your cost basis now for the actual reason, and hold. DFV didn't get here by following a hype train, he made a solid thesis and held. Emoji's are nice and everything but take responsibility for yourselves and treat these like actual positions and fix your numbers.

Also avoid the options of these stocks if you don't understand what IV is.

Then the RH crap happened and a lot of short was covered, blowing up the stock price.  It recovered some on Friday as positions were covered before close of the week.  

Something else happened though - they started shorting even more.  They saw that a squeeze happened and believed that would end it and it would all be done.  I don't think there are ladder attacks, any secret formula, or any other conspiracies going on.  What is happening is we are in the middle of a battle between various whales.  The more of us there are, the more the balance shifts towards the longs.  Looking at short interest, it is still >50% so that is good for the squeeze.  But we have to realize - this isn't the same game anymore.

The old shorts have been covered, we are now up against the new shorts.  It is still incredibly heavily shorted.  The old reason of the stock blowing up was the exponentially increasing media attention bringing on new buyers.  They are gone now.  What happens next?  

I don't think we have to dig super deeply into key dates, failure to delivers, expirations.  I think the squeeze can start again when another market factor hits.  When GME makes a statement, when market conditions change, something.  We saw a downward trend as folks were paper handed out of this stock.  We saw an uptick when it hit the bottom and folks had some hope of a squeeze.  I predict nothing big will change in the next few days unless there is a significant change in information.  But nothing will happen if we don't hold, that's the only thing for sure.

If you look at its business the four years prior to 2020, it was fairly stable with revenues during that 4 year period ranging from $25.3-25.9B with EBITDA greater than $2.1B for each year during that period. They were aggressively deleveraging during this period having reduced debt from $7.6B to $4.2B (these number exclude capital leases). Then in 2020, the COVID crisis occurred and Macy’s business suffered mightily as stores were closed due to local restrictions. Management took a number of actions such as raising additional cash, suspending the dividend, cutting CAPEX, closing unprofitable stores, reducing inventory and cutting SG&A. In 2020, sales will likely end up being down about 30% to $17.8B with EBITDA being slightly positive (\~$50M). But I would argue that 2020 will be the trough in revenues and earnings for Macy’s. As we move into 2021 and the pandemic mitigates, people will return to shopping in stores and Macy’s sales will start to show Y/Y positive comps as they progress through the year. Current average analyst expectations for 2021 call for M to make $0.65/share.  


However, I believe that Wall Street is way too bearish on this company. Currently 6 analysts rate Macy’s as a sell with one brave analyst going positive on the company in December with a Buy rating. But if you look at the last two earnings releases, Macy’s blew away analyst’s weak expectations by wide margins with upside surprises of $0.96/share in Q2 and $0.60/share in Q3. With this bearish slant, I believe M will blow away expectations again in Q4. The average analyst expectation only calls for earnings of $0.04/share in the holiday quarter. But I project they will make just shy of $1/share (ex. items) assuming sales come in about $6.7B. Part of the reason for the bearish stance is many of these analyst’s clients are short Macy’s stock.  


One of the biggest arguments shorts make is the Macy’s in too indebted with high interest debt. But at the end of Q3, M had $1.55B in cash on the balance sheet and had net debt of only $3.8B. The cash level will only improve coming out of the holiday quarter where EBITDA will be greater than $700M. When revenues return to normalized levels, the debt level is <2x EBITDA. With the cash on the balance sheet, they have ample liquidity to cover interest payments of $80M/quarter. Also, no significant debt maturities are coming due in the next couple years that are not already covered by existing cash and future cash flows. Some of M’s debt is secure by their real estate holdings which is valued at double the current market cap of the company.  


When I look at how they compare against competitors, their stock price currently is priced at a discount. Macy’s sells for a P/S of 0.24 compared with Kohl’s (0.42), Dillard’s (0.43) or Nordstrom’s (0.51). One could argue that share price should be selling for around $30/share to have comparable valuations. But I would argue that Macy’s should have a higher multiple due to their e-Commerce business which made up 38% of sales in the most recent quarter growing at a 27% Y/Y clip. Macy’s is currently the 10th largest e-Commerce retailer in the US (Amazon is #1 and sports a 4.5 P/S). If I look at those on the list that are slightly bigger players, all are brick & mortars and sport much higher P/S ratios, #7 Best Buy (0.62), #8 Target (1.04) and #9 Costco (0.91). If valued with a similar P/S ratio, Macy’s should sell for $38-65/share.  


Part of the reason Macy’s share price is depressed is because it is heavily shorted. Currently over 28% of the float is short the stock. The shorts are unjustifiable bearish on a company that is undervalued compared to its peer even though has a greater e-Commerce presence and will be returning to profitability in 2021 post COVID. But I think other players in the market will exploit this heavily shorted situation in the near term by pushing the shares higher. Heavy buying of Feb. 19 calls would suggest the price will be pushed higher ahead of the company’s earnings release which will likely happen late in February. If Q4 earnings exceed analyst expectations by a large margin as I expect, we could see a short squeeze due to the heavy short interest.  


We will see what happens with Macy’s this month and longer term. My contention is it is worth a lot more than $15/share, more realistically it is worth $30-40/share, which is why I am long."|2021-02-02 17:09:36.920627|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170941.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['B', 'B', 'BITDA', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'COVID', 'CAPEX', 'A', 'B', 'BITDA', 'I', 'Y', 'M', 'I', 'I', 'M', 'I', 'B', 'M', 'B', 'B', 'BITDA', 'M', 'BITDA', 'I', 'S', 'I', 'Y', 'US', 'I', 'S', 'S', 'COVID', 'I', 'I', 'I']|[]

Listen to me when I speak these words (mods pls don't delete). Today is the worst it can get. We hit a floor at $80 due to short ladder attacks over the last few days. $80 is the neutral price target that the guys over at [www.gmedd.com](https://www.gmedd.com) assigned, realistically it can't drop lower without it literally being an undervalued stock. No one of GME gang is selling, so stop pointing fingers at eachother. Only margin call marvins are forced to sell, may their hands rest in paper. Overall this is blatant artifical price lowering that will come back to bite the hedge funds in the ass eventually. Just wait and see.

Let's cut to the chase: everyone that saw their unrealised gains evaporate over the last couple of days and turn into losses needs to chill the fuck out. The best thing to compare this to in your mind is a tsunami. **At first, there is an earthquake**. This is our subreddit getting GME on our radars and massively buying in, this has become an international movement against corporate greed. The shock was felt throughout the entire financial ecosystem.  
**Then because of the earthquake, the ocean pulls back from the shores.** This is the hedge funds attacking us with all kinds of illegal manipulation right now to try and pull us apart, they try to make us sell our stock at prices that are below five digits (what are they thinking?). **But what the hedge funds forget is that when the ocean pulls back, a big wave is forming silently in the distance**. A wave (the MOASS) with such a colossal force that it will wipe out anything standing in its way. And when that wave hits, there will be hell to pay.

You guys only need to **diamond hold on for your dear lives** while the wave builds. I know things seem bleak right now, but there is no way the squeeze doesn't happen at this point. Remember, the hedge funds initially got in at a price of $20 and pushed it down to $4. The $80 floor is still 4 times their initial buy in price. Of course, over the times old shorters sold their positions to new shorters, but the positions remain the same. Those loons are still betting for a GameStop bankruptcy. Hedge funds have been bleeding ever since the price recovered to $20 and continue to bleed at this very moment, eventually they will have to throw in the towel. Despite what you may read on this forum from very motivated autists with good intentions, it is impossible to know when exactly the squeeze will happen because that is up to the hedgies themselves. **All I know is that right now the tsunami alarms are going off and all hedge funds must be evacuated. Because the Big Wave is building up at this very moment and will inevitably hit the shores.** Thanks for reading this until the end. Stay healthy, stay safe and most of all: hold GME because *you like the stock*.

So many people who don't even own shares are commenting in the Daily Discussion threads causing quite a few people to feel a semblance of doubt. So many bots / interns are trying to sway the hivemind into being scared. Neither party realizes, as sad as it may be, none of us here can read.

I hold 25 shares of GME, I went all in with my savings @ $80. Yes, I can afford to lose that amount of money. No, I am not complaining about anything money related in this post. I, like many others, have seen our accounts reach numbers that before last week, we didn't even think possible. Mine personally hit a high of $12,000 or so. I have never had that much money in my life. Did I cash out? No, of course not.

Come today, where I have less than $500 profit, and I am still very happy with how everything is going. I'm going to start telling some information that some people are going to question: on Thursday we will prevail. Thursday is an important day - I predict tomorrow we will see status quo with the last few days - but on Thursday, everything changes for us.

To begin with, it is the day in which I become one year more retarded. Secondly, the phase of the moon that night correlates perfectly to millions being added to our side. Third - hear me out - we are too fucking powerful for these Hedge Fund looking assholes to withstand 4 days of this shit.

This is where we fight, this is where we stand, and this is where we will prevail. I will see you on the moon Thursday / Friday, young retards.

A lot of you don't know me, as I don't usually post here. I'm usually over at /r/AMD_stock posting DD there. But I'm posting here because the recent activity in the stock led me to realize a huge, glaring problem with the stock's performance and it's latest earnings.

Let me step back a bit first.

Last Friday the stock plummeted 12% after posting the best earnings it possibly could have posted. At AMD_Stock, we usually brush off the post-earnings crush and continue our bull plays (or the smarter ones wait until after earnings to get back in). But this post-earnings crush was different. For this earnings, there was zero fundamental reason why the stock should go down. The earnings were excellent, the margins were excellent, the guidance for 1Q21 was incredible, and the guidance for FY21 was almost double what the street was expecting. Yet the stock still went down. It went down from $94 pre-earnings to almost $84....*on the best possible news*. 

What more could the street have wanted? Did shareholders want a +60% revenue increase YoY, instead of just +40%? Did they want 3x year-over-year revenue in 1Q20, instead of just 2x? Did the street expect us to beat our FY20 targets by more than they anticipated? Did investors want the fab capacity issues to be completely resolved earlier than 2Q21? Did they want Milan to be released earlier than March '21? Was there any reason to sell off after an earnings as incredible as that? You could even see the [bewilderment](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/27/full-interview-with-amd-ceo-lisa-su-on-q4-results-product-pipeline-demand-and-more.html) on Lisa Su's face as she started an interview with CNBC the morning after.

Why? [No financial news](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-q4-2020-advanced-micro-devices-earnings/), not even [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/amd-amd-earnings-q4-2020.html), could pin a 'reason' on the drop.

And then I realized the problem. It's you.

You buy the cheapest AMD weeklies you can and hold them through earnings like it can't go tits up. You hope that AMD beats all expectations, and that the stock price skyrockets on your tendie-train choo-choo-ing to the moon. Post-earnings you sell your OTM calls just as they go ITM to some suck-ass broker-dealer, and go do some hookers and blow and make a golden shrine to Mama Su and thank her for your amazing luck. Good thing those stupid broker-dealers were so desperate to buy your calls just before expiry.. you would have bankrupted them if you held on to them any longer!

The day after earnings comes and you wake up and the price is down 5% and dropping. You sell immediately, because you can't see it recovering by Friday, when your calls expire. This causes MMs to sell the shares they bought as a hedge against selling you your calls. Stock goes down further. Other people sell their calls, and MMs sell more shares to reduce the hedge even more, on and on until Friday expiration rolls around and bag-holders let their calls expire worthless, along with their hopes and dreams.

Stop losing at AMD! How? *INVEST PROPERLY*

How? Buy and hold shares or LEAPS. Stop chasing the mythical overnight gains. AMD is a *long-term success* and it has [room to double](https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l6jijo/rosenblatt_securities_says_amd_could_double_in/). DO IT NOW - Price is recovering from the crush, but are still trading at a [20% discount to analyst consensus](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast), and at a 10% discount from it's recent highs.

Conclusion: This is a better buy-and-hold than GME, BB, or anything. AMD has grown continuously in the past 5 years and, if you read the DD on /r/AMD_stock, you'll discover that it also has an incredible growth roadmap the next 5 years.

Stop losing. Buy shares and double your money.

This has been a rough week so far. GME is closing at around 90, and either you are seeing massive losses, or the unrealized gains you had evaporate right in front of your eyes. The media is spewing out 200 articles per day saying 'Gamestop is over', and that anyone who stays in the stock is retarded.

But it's simple. As Mark Cuban himself said,  

>If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.  
>  
>Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of.

And ask yourself, **what WSB is really made of?** Is it just plain autistic and retarded traders? Yes, but we also have our Diamond community. People that are actively trying to beat the market, that do their due diligence, and that want to bathe in chicken tendies.

And we have seen post after post of their DD, reinforcing over and over what we were always here for.   
And let me tell you: **Nothing has changed.**

# The short term plan (SHORT SQUEEZE)

Alright, I'll bust out the numbers quick:   
[https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&submit=Short+Quote™](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&submit=Short+Quote™) says that the Short Interest is stil  61,780,000 shares, or 120%. The shorters have obviously refilled their shorts, knowing that their **market manipulation has driven the price down wonders.**

**Their greatest hope** to **avoid** the *Squozening* is to scare off everyone who is holding. They won't stop dumping the stock using everything they have to keep the price away from execution princes, and **avoid getting gamma squeezed again.**

**But,** this doesn't change that 120% of short interest is still insane. They have RELOADED their own failure, failing to acknowledge the power the retail trading community posseses. 

In fact, the stock has been put in the NYSE restricted list of Short selling. They quite literally can't short this stock anymore. So once this rises again, the MMs have NO REASON to start dropping the price again, as they can't benefit once more from shorting on the way down.

This week we are extremely weak as a community due to the immense number of traders having to transfer to Fidelity/Schwab/other brokers, and the MMs have clearly made great use of this. Hell, Drivewealth, one of the biggest clearing brokers for international traders (such as myself), restricted buying GME, and have said to be able to clear buying GME very soon

But as the fund transfers are complete, and Robinhood acquires more capital to realize their trades, and the other brokers lift restrictions, GME will MOST DEFINITIVELY skyrocket. Once the rocket starts going off again, ALL THE FOMO FROM PEOPLE WHO MISSED 300+ WILL SHOW!

**So the SHORT SQUEEZE STILL CAN HAPPEN.** 

# The long term plan (RYAN COHEN IS GOD, Q4 is still coming)

Don't forget that we still have Ryan Cohen on board, and with expected record sales from this console cycle, Gamestop is very far away from going bankrupt. 

Remember: The ideal situation for shorts is a bankruptcy/delisting.

Ryan Cohen is still in, the Quarterly report for GME is still coming, and the long term prospects of the company are still FUCKING BULLISH.  Even if we can't force a squeeze in february, long term changes done to the company can still trigger a short squeeze. In fact, most of the rise of GME so far has been done through investors buying in, not through short squeezes. 

Yes, it is fact that many shorts have covered (At BILLIONS of losses), but this doesn't change our fundamental thesis: *Gamestop + Ryan Cohen = Rokit mun*. The VW squeeze happened after DAYS of red, you better believe we can end up waiting for a month for the squoze.

# TLDR: HOLD OR BUY MORE, YOU FUCKING APES. IT'S NOT OVER. You know why? BECAUSE

# WE. LIKE. THE. STOCK.

I know this isnt GME DD, (and you mother fuckers better not sell GME to buy into this) but this is too good to miss out on.

Chart Analysis:

Dollar General is near its 6M low, incredibly oversold and anything near 190 is a fucking steal. Overall, the RSI is 41 on the yearly and trading well under the 50 and 200 SMA.

*Processing img 0a4wq3jco4f61...*

I know the F word is shunned here and I don't use it very much, but the FUNDAMENTALS ARE FUCKING CRAZY. With these fundamentals the price it's trading at it is criminal. After consulting the Bloomberg terminal, the monkey analysts have a price target of $235 and the majority of them have buy ratings on the stock. In addition, Dollar General has an estimated revenue of +20%  YoY and a P/E ratio of 19. Overall the sentiment on DG is very bullish, and If you don't give a shit about what the analysts say the value of the stock is shown in the fundamentals, they are just confirmation bias.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Play/TL;DR:

Earnings is on March 11, I expect a good run up correction before then. The Fundamentals show that IT LITERALLY CANT GO TITS UP.

You might think that you would never FOMO into a stock or you might be wondering if this applies to you. Ask yourself these questions to find out if you need the checklist. 

- Have you ever thought of buying some super hyped shares at ATH?

- Have you thought about joining ‘the team’ in the squeeze on stockthatshallnotbenamed? (Ps. there are no teams in retail investing it’s every man for himself)

- Do you use WallStreetBets? 

If you answered yes to any of the precursor questions below then you are in danger of a FOMO trade and need this checklist. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HOW NOT TO FOMO CHECKLIST 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Ask yourself why you want to buy the stock. Are you jealous of others gains? Do you want to be part of that weeks big thing? If yes to either then do not buy. Jealous trading is bad trading. 

2. Warren Buffet said “be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.” Ask yourself if people are being greedy with the stock you want to buy, do not buy if they are. 

3. Ask yourself “am I being a sheep?” Sheep do not make money on the stock market, they don’t even understand the stock market, they are sheep. Don’t be a sheep. 

4. Where did you see the stock? If it was on the news don’t buy it. If it’s trending on one of the subreddits then it’s probably too late. 

5. Is it often appearing on the subreddit and being regularly pushed by the same small crowd? Watch out cause without proof they are probably bag holders hoping to pass the bag to you. 

6. Can you explain to somebody what the company does and why it is a good idea to buy it? If not then you shouldn’t buy it yourself. 

7. Is the market mostly red or mostly green that week? Sell on green weeks and buy on red weeks. It might feel like the other way around at the time but that’s emotional trading. 
8. Is it a meme stock? If yes then be an early adopter or don’t adopt at all. 

9. Have you got spare capital? If money is no issue to you or if you are making a small punt that won’t harm your finances then go ahead. If you are making a big, late move into a meme stock then you’ll be seeing red. 

10. Does it have emojis in the DD’s? If yes then disregard all previous steps and bet your house on it."|2021-02-02 17:09:36.920627|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170941.csv|DueDiligence|['A', 'FOMO']|[]|['FOMO', 'ATH', 'FOMO', 'HOW', 'NOT', 'TO', 'FOMO', 'KLIST', 'I']|[]

***TLDR: I think I've found at least 3 violations of SEC regulations?***

Compiling some research, post not complete but being used for dumping SEC regulations that appear to have been violated based on last weeks GME shenanigans:

1) ***Rule 201 – Short Sale Price Test Circuit Breaker.*** Rule 201 generally requires trading centers to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to prevent the execution or display of a short sale at an impermissible price when a stock has triggered a circuit breaker by experiencing ***a price decline of at least 10 percent in one day.*** *Once the circuit breaker in Rule 201 has been triggered, the price test restriction* ***will apply to short sale orders in that security for the remainder of the day and the following day,*** unless an exception applies.

2) ***Rule 203(b)(1) and (2) – Locate Requirement.*** Regulation SHO requires a broker-dealer to have ***reasonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed*** so that it can be delivered on the date delivery is due before effecting a short sale order in any equity security.[[7]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn7) ***This “locate” must be made and documented prior to effecting the short sale.***

3) ***Rule 204 – Close-out Requirement.*** Rule 204 requires brokers and dealers that are participants of a registered clearing agency[[8]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn8) to take action to close out failure to deliver positions. Closing out requires the broker or dealer to purchase or borrow securities of like kind and quantity. 

The participant must close out a failure to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+4. If a participant has a failure to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona fide market making activities, the participant must close out the failure to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. 

If the position is not closed out, the broker or dealer and any broker or dealer for which it clears transactions (for example, an introducing broker)[[9]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn9) may not effect further short sales in that security without borrowing or entering into a bona fide agreement to borrow the security (known as the “pre-borrowing” requirement) until the broker or dealer purchases shares to close out the position and the purchase clears and settles. 

In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO ***requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out failures to deliver in securities with large and persistent failures to deliver,*** referred to as “threshold securities,” ***if the failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.***[[10]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn10) 

Threshold securities are equity securities[[11]](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm#_ftn11) that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency (e.g., National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)); ***totaling 10,000 shares or more; and equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer's total shares outstanding.*** 

As provided in Rule 203 of Regulation SHO, threshold securities are included on a list disseminated by a self-regulatory organization (“SRO”). Although as a result of compliance with Rule 204, generally a participant’s fail to deliver positions will not remain for 13 consecutive settlement days, ***if, for whatever reason, a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency in a threshold security for 13 consecutive settlement days, the requirement to close-out such position under Rule 203(b)(3) remains in effect.***

Still reading through it myself but it seems that there have been violations of ***SHO Rules 201,203, and 204, any input would be greatly appreciated!***

***TLDR;***

***1) NO SHORTS should have been executed Thursday when GME dropped down to $132 because it fell more than 10%***

***2) No new shorts should have been issued because there's no reasonable belief that they could find actual stock to lend given 140% short float, and I doubt they secured it PRIOR to issuing new stock***

***3)They should have already executed the failed to delver shorts ASAP because of the high number of FTD's and the high number of shorted shares***

Then WSB got involved and skyrocketed this stock and I bought 6250 more trying to ride the momentum and now im in the negative. I mostly blame the DTCC and robinhood. But I'm still here bleeding out. But This stock is seriously undervalued. I mean just look at CCL which is another pandemic play and nothing is really going to happen with them just like AMC, they are in the same boat. Yet AMC was undervalued but now has the capital to survive and getting bailed out. So take what you want from this but AMC outside of a short squeeze play is not overvalued and once you factor in the WSB momentum and recognition this stock is way undervalued.

So to start off I wanna disclose my GME position. I bought 1 share at $20 and 🧻🙌 at $30. I then rebought in with .9 shares at a 152 avg and I am still holding them but we all know what happened Thursday and me literally living paycheck to paycheck I couldn’t invest more on fidelity or Webull without selling my 122 shares of AMC at 5.69 (nice), and my 24 share of BB.

With that being said I am still HOLDING even at a loss and here is why:

So to start off I need to clear something up THE VW CHART IS OVER A YEAR AND GME IS OVER A MONTH. If you zoom out to 3 months or further you see how high GME jumped. So to be a 🌈🐻 here Thursday might have been the short squeeze and due to RH and other companies cutting off trading stopped the squeeze. The problem here is that a lot of GME investors then became emotionally invested which lead to this sub being flooded with RH hate and post about the squeeze has not been squoze. Now this MAY be true still but I may also be wrong.

WHY I AM HOLDING

1. 💎🙌 what if the squeeze hasn’t been squoze?

2. I only have $150 in which although is a good amount for me it is nothing compared to what I see some people have in it and if they can hold/ stick it to the HFs so can I.

3. I think GME has a future now. If Ryan Cohen can do what he did with Chewy then there is no reason GME won’t have a solid low price stock that will slowly climb.

4. GME is now the brand of a “movement”. I see a lot of talk on here about going to GameStop now and in the future for anything video game related in order to ensure that they don’t get bankrupted by HFs and if this continues that would be good for the company since there are 8+ mil of us on this sub. Combine that with the insane amount of free advertisement from media and billboards (I even bought one in New Orleans for a few days with $20 since RH wouldn’t let me invest) and even people who aren’t on WSB now have GameStop in the back of their minds. This company now has a second chance to do it right.

5. This is more of a personal reason but lets say GME bottoms out and doesn’t squeeze, I’m just gonna BUY THE DIP and this will average down my cost of $152 per share and since I like this stock I can just hold long term and as the company grows so will my stock and profit. Now I understand this might not work if you have a ton of money in but for people in my situation who believe in Ryan Cohen and GameStop this is a viable strategy to 💎🙌 your way to a profit.

So I just wanna thank everybody on this sub for the week of memes, calling out of a corrupt system, donations to charity and hopefully the saving of GameStop I’m glad I was and still am a part of this history.

TLDR; VW squeeze and GME squeeze are different don’t compare but if you can afford to and truly like the stock 💎🙌 GME worst case scenario you save a company that has a new lease on life and best case 🚀🚀🚀🚀 to the 🌕 while the HFs go down.

Edit 1: I also just realized they GME used to pay dividends. If they bring them back this could also help recoup any money lost if you try to average down."|2021-02-02 18:18:38.936034|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_181845.csv|DueDiligence|['GME', 'I']|['GME']|['I', 'TLDR', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'AMC', 'BB', 'I', 'LDING', 'I', 'THE', 'VW', 'CHART', 'IS', 'OVER', 'A', 'YEAR', 'AND', 'GME', 'IS', 'OVER', 'A', 'MONTH', 'GME', 'RH', 'GME', 'RH', 'MAY', 'I', 'WHY', 'I', 'AM', 'LDING', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'RH', 'WSB', 'GME', 'BUY', 'THE', 'DIP', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'VW', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'GME']|['GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'RH', 'GME', 'RH', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'RH', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Today we saw our precious $GME fall to a level we have not seen since last Thursday - and then ever further beyond that point. We entered AH today at a lowly $90 per share. We may be entering our darkest hour yet.

Today we also got some good news too - the Mark Cuban AMA went well, and AMC theaters are reopening soon! Some executives are sharing that we may get $GME to over $1,000 soon, and if you compare our graphs with the Volkswagen graph from 2008, we have the M shape, we have the dip, and now we await the spike.

Let's get into what today meant for us. This has been a second hard day this week. Many are seeing either massive losses or unrealized gains evaporating. The media is delivering article after article on GameStop, literally every time the price falls a single dollar it seems. Today we have learned some new things - some of you may have read this, some of you may have learned this the hard way, and some of you might not accept this: if YOU personally can afford to hold this stock, you hold. Why would you sell? We have seen where this can go, we have seen how badly these guys are bleeding, we have seen the stock bounce from 450 to 124 to 300 in a span of 24 hours.

As of today, there are only 2.5 days for Wall Street to cover their shorts. This is a wave that is building up slowly and we are not going to let it go. We could potentially fuck Melvin and the gang THIS WEEK. In another post I made earlier today I had mentioned Thursday as my estimation of t-day (tendies day) - I still stand by that: Thursday will be the beginning, but Thursday will not be the end of anything. Posts today have mentioned that Melvin may be committing massive fraud by illegally covering their shorts - and I believe them.

As investors, we control the market by holding. The people we are fighting against, Melvin and Gang, they can't do this forever. Hell, they probably can't do this for another week. They have spent the last few days sowing dissent in our community, monitoring everything we do, and trying to get the upper hand yet again. The only problem for them - they can't. As long as WE hold our shares, they have already lost. They would need to get people like DFV to sell in order to make a dent in our morale.

**So what does any of what I just said mean?**

We are gonna see status quo tomorrow. Buy the fire sale if you like the stock, if you don't, don't. Thursday or Friday, we start seeing a fire get lit underneath Melvin's hairy nuts and we will watch it spread viciously, all while making ourselves a quick buck.

**Will there be a lot of time for us all to get out?**

Like anything like this, some will make more than others. Selling lowers the price of a stock. If you need $10,000 for a life saving surgery, pull out at $10,000. We joke a lot about how everyone needs to hold, but most people will not hold it against you. We get that sometimes the money IS more important than the cause.

**What if it doesn't happen this Thursday/Friday?**

Then we wait. This is a game of patience. To the patient go the tendies!

**What is a short ladder attack?**

Hedgefunds bid on each other's stock, lowering the price artificially. There is little volume on these trades - since nobody can buy, it plummets the price. The only effect it has is if we sell, which not many people are doing.

**Why are so many people still holding? Why didn't we cash out earlier?**

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. This event has the potential to change lives and change rules. Personally, as long as I sell over 80$, I won't be sad.

Position: 25 shares @ 80$

Note: this is not financial advice in any way, I have a PhD in Apenomics, but I sadly am illiterate and have no thumbs. Thank you u/SEC.

I've borrowed and dumbed down this chart from [this savant's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l97jbo/gamestop_big_picture_market_mechanics/).

As the free-flowing stock dries up (due to ppl buying and holding), the volatility increases. It becomes easier and easier to move the needle with less money. As long as you keep holding and buying, the volatility will only increase. **Expect huge swings in the next few days.**

Hedge funds know this. They tanked the stock this morning with ladder attacks. Right now they intentionally leveling the demand to keep the stock price stable; to make it look like the ride is over.

HOWEVER

The short float is still high, and the [volume has been steadily decreasing](https://i.imgur.com/eRH3S2b.png).

**Furthermore, GME just got put on the** [NSYE Short Sale Restrictions List](https://www.wallstreetdaily.com/2019/05/20/ssr-what-it-is-and-what-you-need-to-know/). Tomorrow (for one day only)  short-sale orders can only be executed at a price higher than the current best bid. This will put a huge damper on the shorties ability to lower the price.

Keep in mind the VW squeeze happened with far less short-interest than is currently in GME. The main problem is that retail investors, unlike huge firms, can't vacuum up all the supply fast enough, which enables the hf to slowly wiggle their way out buying up paper hands. They've likely exited their worst short positions and reshorted at a better price.

Some people are saying the squeeze might be more of a slow gradual upward pressure, rather than a sudden event. The truth is that the hedge funds are walking on a tightrope, and this stock is still extremely volatile. Any big movements in demand can drastically impact the price.

Disclaimer: I am a poker player, not a day trader.  In poker, this is what we call an ""implied odds play"". The risk is relatively small for us bulls (relative to the short position), but the expected value is potentially huge if it works.  But these plays are still risky despite being +EV. **You have to be prepared to ride the swings and embrace the variance.**

As I'm sure many of you who have been following the ""Counterfeit Shares"" theory about the various short attacks on $GME have seen, the SEC publishes lagged data on the cumulative number of Fails to Deliver for every company. If you aren't caught up with the latest info on the counterfeit share theory, take a second and read [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/)'s \[post\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the\_real\_reason\_wall\_street\_is\_terrified\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)) laying out the issue with hedge funds counterfeiting shares and how it relates to GME. Much of the analysis in Johnny's post comes from an article \[""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""\]([http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)) which is definitely worth a read if you have the time and patience to do a deep dive into the evil shit carried out by hedge funds.

**TLDR of Johnny's post:** Hedge funds create a bunch of stock out of thin air and short it, selling the counterfeit shares on the open market and driving the price of a company down. They then fail to come up with the shares they sold in time, so the ""counterfeit"" shares are never backed up by real shares. This could be happening on a massive scale with GME, and Hedge Funds could have far greater exposure to GME than previously thought.

&#x200B;

**The Data:**

I noticed that while [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and later [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/) used data from the SEC releases in their posts, the data they actually showed was only a small piece, and lacked very important context. So, with that in mind, I took the SEC Fails-to-Deliver data \[releases\]([https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)) for both halves of November and December and the first half of January and took a look at what was going on using some pivot tables. I thought given the sheer amount of data (1.5 million cells) it would be tough to load in Excel but it actually ended up being pretty easy. (probably helped that my day job is just alternately making pivot tables and slamming my head into the wall, I've gotten pretty good at both)

IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS RELEASE EXTENDS TO JANUARY 14TH, 2021. THESE ARE NOT CURRENT CUMULATIVE OUTSTANDING FAIL-TO-DELIVER LEVELS

&#x200B;

**Fails-to-Deliver Distributions:**

First, take a look at this handy histogram(ish) of companies with outstanding Fails-to-Deliver and their outstanding ""counterfeit share"" (cumulative Fails-to-Deliver) numbers:

https://preview.redd.it/6dmfpfql47f61.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf38fea8f5de2e45b36b48853f4d7afaca8f6c28

As you can see, GME is way outside of the pack when it comes to Fail to Delivers, and has significantly more ""counterfeit shares"" (FTDs) than almost any other company. The exact number comes in at a cool 621,483 shares. The x-axis scale isn't even linear, and you can see significant jumps in the last quarter.

&#x200B;

If you think that's some crazy shit, wait until you see the distribution of Fail-to-Delivers per company by the dollar value of counterfeit shares ((Closing Price)\*(# of Outstanding Fails-to-Deliver)):

https://preview.redd.it/024mdiv147f61.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=270fc53a5455994545a864e8b8e9c304b0e57b5c

GameStop has the SECOND HIGHEST Fails-to-Deliver net dollar value of all 5,147 stocks with current fail-to-delivers (as of 1/14/21). NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS of stock floating around that was simply created out of thin air. Here the x-axis isn't even linear either — if it were to scale, GME would be several meters to my right. Wild.

&#x200B;

**Cumulative Fails-to-Deliver of GME over Time:**

Moving on to more interesting (and potentially more troubling) data, I took a look at the Fails-to-Deliver values over time for GME. I decided to go back to the beginning of November, then look at every number the SEC had released since on FTDs for GME. This is crucial context for the numbers that have been thrown around by [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/).

https://preview.redd.it/myt4zxy347f61.png?width=1328&format=png&auto=webp&s=603b5d5f0a623dc0dc9ef0df1f3da05e7361340f

Now, this one is a lot less clear-cut than those histograms I just wrote about. As you can see, there have been huge fluctuations in the amount of ""counterfeit stock"" (Fails-to-Deliver) on the market. There is a definite pattern of Hedge Funds running up Fails-to-Deliver during GME surges and then covering once the price slumps a bit. I've talked with one of my sources involved with hedge fund operations, and he said this is pretty standard procedure — when you sell a naked short and the price spikes, you talk it out with your broker and get a few more days to cover. So really, this pattern is more or less normal. It's the stupidly large amounts Fails-to-Deliver that are getting churned that is the irregular part.

Here's a good spot to bring up my main concern with the kind of analyses that [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/) were putting out. You can see that there were 1.8 million Fails-to-Deliver on GME on December 2nd, but that number was basically completely covered by the 16th. Based on that data it seems at first glance that, for the most part, these reported Fails-to-Deliver are Hedge Funds/Brokers trying to avoid covering while high and simply waiting for the next dip. This data alone IS NOT SUFFICIENT to prove that there is an enormous, market-moving quantity of Fails-to-Deliver floating around the market. Of course, right after this data cuts out, GME shoots to the moon (300+), and I would expect a lot of naked short vendors were caught with their pants down. Maybe they all covered on the recent dips, maybe loads of Fails-to-Deliver are still out there.

A table with that GME info from the graph above for any lurking nerds:

https://preview.redd.it/0pj2hh0647f61.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcf2d64f6777218dece7735075b779fb51e28cca

&#x200B;

**Some Questionable Inferences and My Retarded Conclusions:**

So, what's the takeaway here, other than don't trust everything you read on WallStreetBets? I think there are a few lessons. First, even though Fails-to-Deliver numbers were bouncing all over the place, including being completely covered on 12/16, I think it's important to keep in mind that GME having this volume of Fails-to-Deliver, both in shares and in dollars, is extremely irregular compared to everything else. Could just be the fact that GME is an insane stock with insane volatility,\* or could be indicative of something more.

*\*Yet, this data is from back before GME became mainstream — GME in December was not an ""unprecedented situation"" like we have now. Thinking back to then, the high Fails-to-Deliver numbers are even more significant.*

&#x200B;

**A Possibility of Hedge Fund Armageddon:**

I want to take a second to talk about one of the diagrams from the good folks who wrote \[""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""\]([http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)), detailing both the ""surface level"" indicators of Disclosed Shorts and Fails-to-Deliver, and the below-the-surface hidden pathways that they believed pumped counterfeit shares into our financial system. Here it is:

https://preview.redd.it/v3io9bj847f61.jpg?width=1086&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21d67bbec3d7d4e3b2012b3d51cdaf462ae3318d

As you can see, the Counterfeiting 2.0 authors believed that Fails-to-Deliver were just the tip of the iceberg. Below the surface (and out of the sight of the SEC), they believed there was a massive volume of shares that had been ""laundered,"" through foreign exchanged, offshore funds, or even gaps in the Continuous Net Clearing system at the DTCC. These stocks, theoretically, go from Fails-to-Deliver to simple counterfeit shares, or even straight to counterfeits. The arguments in the Counterfeiting 2.0 paper go way over my head as a simple retard, but I get the gut feeling at least some of them are accurate.

If, hypothetically, (please read this part in your best Ben Shapiro voice), the arguments in Counterfeiting 2.0 are true, then it is highly likely that the huge Fails-to-Deliver churn on the surface is just the tip of a massive illegal counterfeit short position. GME BULLS, listen up. If this counterfeit short position does exist, then it was probably entered back when GME was being driven towards bankruptcy, at a share price somewhere in the $15/20 range, and possibly expanded when GME was being driven down below $5. There are actually interesting data to suggest that this is a plausible scenario. First, the fact that, as [/u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) noted a year ago, the market cap of GME was driven below the net value of its assets. Obviously, this happens from time to time, but it's indicative of an extremely artificially depressed valuation. Secondly, the central use of illegal naked shorting is in driving companies to bankruptcy, and it did seem like GME was on its way out. Looking at GME as a scummy hedge fund manager, it would have made a very attractive target for a naked-short dilution attack.

These illegal short positions, if they were not covered by cautious (lol) Hedgies at the beginning of the GME runup, would have increased 50-100x in dollar value as the share price of GME rose. That's 5,000-10,000% for those who can't do basic math. Now I don't know if this scenario would be enough to crash the market, but it would certainly be enough to make a lot of extremely powerful people (currently engaged in a criminal enterprise) desperate and very, very angry. This hardly needs saying, but rich bastards have killed for far less than a billion dollars. Here, there could be tens of billions on the line.

So, that's the mega-bull case. We, the tards of WSB, expose billions in financial crime. The SEC rappels into Citadel and arrests everyone, Robinhood goes bankrupt, and all our wives and their boyfriends get filthy rich. However, there is also a very significant BEAR case here. If the regular, everyday investors who wrote Counterfeiting 2.0 were in fact retards like us, then there's a significant chance that they simply got it wrong. Maybe there is no sea of hidden counterfeit short positions, and maybe this whole Fails-to-Deliver thing is just rich assholes using extra trading days to cheaply sell shorts. What then? In that case, I would bet my left nut that all of the outstanding Fails-to-Deliver have been covered in the recent slump, and this whole exciting report is largely irrelevant to the future performance of GME.

I'm not going to make the case that either the bulls or the bears are right (even though my gut is with the bulls) because I simply don't have the information or mental capacity to make that call. Look at the data yourself, and draw your own conclusions. Retail is facing an enemy with more capital, more information, more experience, and fewer morals. Whichever way it goes, it's going to be an ugly fight.

&#x200B;

Positions: 12 shares (Bought 50 at $20, sold 50 at $250, bought back in 12 at $300). I plan to hold until either $4,000 a share or things go to shit.

&#x200B;

I am not a financial advisor, and I do not advise any readers to make financial decisions based on my opinions or the information presented in this report.

&#x200B;

# TLDR: the cumulative Fails-to-Deliver volume on GME is massive compared to the rest of the market. However, is also extremely volatile, and small compared to the float. It is possible that high Fails-to-Deliver volume is a result of massive illegal share counterfeiting by shorts.

Corsair IPO'ed in September at $17.00 and the stock went rocket rocket straight upto 30$+. The all time highs has been 50$ ish and is currently trading at 38$. They absolutely destroyed Q3 earnings and beat expectations in every department.   


**Here's some of the highlights of their Q3 earnings, Source :- globenewswire & their Q3 report.**

Net revenue was $457.1 million, an increase of 60.7% year-over-year. Segment net revenue was $161.6 million, an increase of 128.8% year-over-year. Gaming components and systems segment net revenue was $295.5 million, an increase of 38.3% year-over-year.

Gross profit was $127.9 million, an increase of 112.4% year-over-year, with gross margin of 28.0%, an improvement of 680 basis points year-over-year.

Operating income was $49.7 million, an increase of 353.6% year-over-year.

Adjusted operating income was $61.4 million, an increase of 193.7% year-over-year.

Net income was $36.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.5 million in the same period a year ago, or $0.02 per diluted share.

Adjusted net income was $48.5 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, an increase of 384.0% year-over-year compared to adjusted net income of $10.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.

Adjusted EBITDA was $63.7 million, an increase of 184.9% year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.9%, an improvement of 610 basis points year-over-year.

As of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $370.1 million.

The stock ran from 21$ to 40$ after their Q3 earnings report so there should be no brainer that stock won't do the same again. **Like I already mentioned, that anything discussed on this DD is not an advice and its a personal opinion.**

$CRSR had a non-dilutive offering last week at $35 per share. This didn't add shares, just gave their initial PE firm a chance to cash out. With 7M shares sold at $35, this built a solid new ""floor"" for the stock on high volume at $35. Corsair has 36% short interest (obviously lower than GME), but the main IPO lock up period doesn't expire til March. Corsair's current available float is only 20% of total shares outstanding while short interest is 36%. Not a lot of shares available for shorts to cover if the stock starts moving against them.

&#x200B;

The Market Cap for this stock is \~3.31 B and their Revenue for Q4 is half of that? Insane. I'm likely expecting it to be way over the estimations above just like when they doubled expectations the quarter before. The floor for this is 35$ as shown by the past month and a half and It peaked at 51$.

**Summary**
TLDR version: Cloud/email/data security. Huge growth, recent acquisition, fair value estimate showing ~50% upside, earnings in 2 weeks at which point the fair value will likely increase even further as the recurring revenues from acquisitions and the continued growth push the data averages higher. 

**Positions**
Call volume for March-May expirys have been spiking, so that's where I'm at. Since the fair value is over $12, I'm buying $11 and $12 strikes.

**Harley Davidson DD- WILD HOGS🐖🚀🐖🚀**

WHO IS READY TO GO HOG WILD! Harley announced earnings and got spanked- no worries… we will go the moon.

If intellectually disabled (🐒) look at the TL;DR

**BULLISH SENTIMENT:**

Jochen Zeitz gives massive hope as a CEO and leader for HOG. The future is EV for the vehicle industry and motorcycles are no different. A niche market for powerful EV bikes has yet to be untapped and is what will push Harley Davidson into the future.

· he became CEO of Puma – making him the youngest ever CEO of a German company at the time – and turned the near-bankrupt business into one of the world's top three sports brands

· he now sits on the boards of Harley-Davidson, financial services company Cranemere, and the Kenya Wildlife Service, as well as running his own charitable foundation and co-chairing The B Team, a non-profit that he co-founded with Richard Branson in 2012 to promote sustainable business practices.

His previous ventures gave him a strong backing socially and experience with sustainable energy which is a must for Harley Davidson.

Touring and Large cruisers remain to be the biggest driver in profit and production for the company. Even through COVID-19 these remain steady. Introduction of their new bike, Pan-America Adventure Touring Motorcycle, is much more appealing to the younger crowd.

**ELECTRIC MOTORCYLES:**

Harley-Davidson is striving to be the leader in electric Motorcycles which will quickly set them apart from all other competitors and introduce a new segment of consumers for HOG. The executive staff is fully committed to a distinct product with go-to market strategies.

**BEARISH SENTIMENT:**

My opinion is that unless I can find compelling evidence that the squeeze is truly done for and off the table, my conviction has only grown stronger.

Most important things that stick out, all of which really build a case that must not be dismissed:

1) If shorts have covered, we should have noticed reasonable strong upwards momentum, as buying pressure consists of short covering along with retail buying, and a limited float.

2) Past few days we've seen trading volumes below average, likely suppressed demand caused by broker restrictions on buying. Lower volume can make any dump pull the price down easily. Especially when the demand side is getting locked out. Have to mention the timing of which Robinhood locked buying last week as well, coinciding with a massive dip.

3) Look at [this image](https://preview.redd.it/dralf2uks4f61.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=52223e916aacb4f65681da1cfe4f5e1ade7cea30)

Notice how AMC & GME have almost identical candlesticks, and the same is in the BB-NOK pair. It is undeniable that a lot of people are buying this stock and holding this stock. Not just in America but all across the world. We have global support.
You would think that with this many people in the trade (whether they are on the buying / selling side) we would see greater variance. This correlation to me looks like obvious manipulation by higher frequency and higher volume algorithmic trading.
It's hard to look at these charts and say that this is natural supply and demand. Seriously, same candlestick patterns on unrelated stocks. This price action is influenced by targeted manipulation to a high degree. Even if people were really selling off like crazy, wouldn't we see more natural candles?

4) We have mainstream media (MSM) covering the ""reddit mania"" extensively. MSM says reddit is trying to squeeze silver, which is false. You will not find anyone pushing to buy SLV on reddit. In fact, you will see a warning about silver and how many HFs have long positions in it.

5) We've seen an influx of bots on social media (reddit, FB, twitter) promoting silver, spamming that GME squeeze is finished, diverting attention away from the more uninformed audience. Why? If it's finished why the need for these?

6) MSM says the short squeeze mania is over and shorts have covered. If that is true, why are we seeing trade restrictions still on more and more brokers, and nonstop coverage all over TV and the internet. If it's over, why are there so many articles bashing retail to stay away?

7) GME is an outlier in the ""failed-to-deliver"" statistic, and has been put on NYSE short restriction (uptick rule). Something fishy is going on with the shares in the float.

8) SI% numbers are very conflicting. Especially the numbers that came around 30-50%. It was then later mentioned by someone in S3 that a different calculation was used. If you convert to the old calculation, you still get over 100% SI%. Why are they trying to change it all of a sudden?

To me, this is enough to say we're still in the game. If it's over, let them prove it by crushing GME to $20 and on February 9th we hear the official SI% being low. Then it's finished. Something tells me that it's not over, and this is all a ploy to mitigate the damage they are about to receive when GME eventually triggers the MOASS.

Can't say for sure it's a 100% trip to the moon and beyond, but what's really suggested otherwise? This whole misinformation campaign + price manipulation combo is too important to dismiss.

Remember I'm retard and please make your own financial decisions. This post is based on my observation and speculation.

Position 50 shares GME $210

🚀💎🙌 $GME to the moon 🚀💎🙌

**TL;DR** - *YES THERE IS LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN A SQUEEZE LAST WEEK, BUT WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING LATELY SUGGESTS THIS IS NOT OVER! MOASS IS POSSIBLE UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE! WAIT FOR ACTUAL CONFIRMATION BEFORE THROWING IN THE TOWEL!*

1. Fact one: Buying has been greater than selling. Buying has been greater than selling. Everyone knows that if we buy and hold, a payday will come at some point thanks to the hedgies continuing to double down on GME shorts.
2. Fact two: multiple stonks have mirrored movement.  See AMC for an example.
3. Fact three: Volume is too fucking low.  Volume was only 77mil today looking at RH.
4. Fact four: the hedgies aren't closing their positions, see #3.  There are no more shares available to short.
5. Fact five: I haven't gone FULL retard.  Never go FULL retard.

My personal opinion is that we are never going to be able to build up enough momentum alone to turn this thing around.  But we don't have to.  We do not need momentum anymore, we just need to maintain scarcity of the shorted stocks.  Literally, just need to hold until the hedgies starts to close their positions, hold for as long as possible, then its all over.

**TL/DR at the bottom**

I do not see nearly enough love for MGNI on r/stocks or WSB so I want to give you all a look in at a one-way ticket to gains.

**What does Magnite ($MGNI) do?**

\- **World’s largest independent supply-side advertising technology company**. This means they help fill advertising space, primarily on websites, apps, and **connected TV (CTV)** platforms. Price per share at time of writing: $40.20

**CTV -** Basically anything that is not cable TV is connected TV. Connecting through your xbox or roku or apple TV or however you want to stream TV. This is the **primary source of revenue** for $MGNI. Are you on the poor people version of Hulu that runs ads? Those ads run through MGNI.

So let me ask you - is there a movement towards cable TV, or a movement towards finding other ways to watch TV through streaming services? I think you know the answer. And that is reason #1 to buy in. **As CTV increases in popularity, so does demand for advertising space, and so does $MGNI revenue.**

**Industry comparison -**

Trade Desk ($TTD). TTD operates on the buy side of ad tech, so while not exactly the same, they are within the same industry. TTD is currently **up 2800%** over the last 4 years, with a market cap of $38.5 billion. Where is $MGNI? A shade under $5 billion. Now is it realistic to expect MGNI to be the next home run play like TTD (who my brother sold for $50/share, RIP)? Predicting anything to go up 2800% in 4 years is unlikely but who knows. But **if MGNI can get to even half the market cap of TTD, that is a price target of $160.** (Current: $40/share, Mcap 4.75 Billion)

**Past/future earnings:**

Past earnings and future earnings show the story of a company with fairly rapid growth. Take a look for yourself:

Q1 2020 Revenue - $36.3MM, up 12% YoY from Q1 2019

Q2 2020 Revenue - $42.3MM, up 12% YoY from Q2 2019

Q3 2020 Revenue - $61MM, up 62% YoY from Q3 2019

*Q4 2020 Revenue - Expected $72-75MM, up \~50% YoY from Q4 2019*

**$MGNI is up %335 in the past 12 mo, am I too late to the party?**

Answer: **NO,** and although I already outlined some reasons why above, here is a list for you:

&#x200B;

1. CTV will      only increase in popularity, which is where the bulk of MGNI revenue comes      from
2. $MGNI is      showing accelerated growth, great for a mid-cap company to try to make the      jump to large-cap
3. Trade Desk      (TTD), who is not a competitor but is in the same industry, is valued      nearly 10x higher than MGNI.
4. Earnings      coming up 2/24, which I expect MGNI to crush, and I do not think that      earnings are priced in yet.
5. Needham      analyst Laura Martin makes MGNI her top pick for 2021, saying 500% growth      is possible (Jan 13 [Why Wall Street analysts think Magnite may be the      next hot play in ad tech (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/why-wall-street-analysts-think-magnite-may-be-the-next-hot-play-in-ad-tech.html))
6. Survived a      short hit piece by Spruce Point Capital on Jan 8 (Thank you for a low      entry point for some calls)
7. **PR Today: Launch of “Unified Decisioning”,** a new MGNI product/software. From article:

*“Publishers are eager to tap into the efficiencies that programmatic provides without relinquishing the control they are used to when selling directly to buyers. Unified Decisioning enables them to do both and we’re excited to bring these capabilities to leading CTV publishers.”* Link: [*Magnite Introduces Open Beta of New CTV & OTT Solution Named Unified Decisioning | Business Wire*](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210202005138/en/Magnite-Introduces-Open-Beta-of-New-CTV-OTT-Solution-Named-Unified-Decisioning)

If you’re interested in companies that are trending from bottom-left to top-right, then I encourage you to invest in $MGNI. I believe it is a **good short-term play**; having just went on a weeklong dip from Jan 22 - Jan 29, I think you have a decent entry point here at $41.50, although I believe any entry point is fine at this stage in the company’s growth. Also in the short-term is earnings on 2/24 which I believe will be good for MGNI. It is also a **good long-term play** for reasons above, my EOY price target is $125, although it would not surprise me if it goes significantly higher. The $MGNI train hasn’t even left the station!

Positions: 100 shares @ $16, 2/19 35c x5, 2/19 40c x2, 2/19 45c x10, 2/19 50c x2 (Slight degeneracy)

**TL/DR:** MGNI is a growing company in the growing industry of advertising in (primarily) connected TV services (Think: Roku). Same realm as $TTD but 1/10th the market cap. Much room to grow. Earnings coming up 2/24 and Laura Martin’s stock pick of 2021. Just released beta of new software today.

Buying the dip accelerates the squeeze by taking the swinging/paper bananas out of the market, giving us greater control over the future price.

I'll start by explaining the difference between Box Office sales vs Streaming.  Streaming is like DVD sales, where the production company must sign over rights to the movie to the service which eliminates any chance at residuals such as Box Office sales which is where a majority of their profit lies.  My theory is that this is why we've only very few ""good"" movies recently, most of the production companies are sitting on their canned file waiting for COVID to be over.

Why I think AMC dropped the ball...  AMC, like other movie theaters already have agreements in place to share ""Box Office"" proceeds with the production companies.  I'm not sure why they wouldn't get creative and offer this same model up during COVID and get a leg up on their competition (Amazon, Google, etc...).  My guess, the same reason that I had to spend an hour doing DD just to find out that the only reason I could see them being viable into the future, they ALREADY had a product for and just don't do anything with.  Their leadership is completely incompetent and the company was being shorted into bankruptcy for a reason.

S3 and Ortex data are estimates, but FINRA data (from which the bimonthly official short interest reports are generated; this is the best there is) have shown that for the last five days, more than 50% of shares sold have been sold short:

[http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210202.txt](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210202.txt) (search GME; see also [2/1](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210201.txt), [1/29](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210129.txt), [1/28](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210128.txt), [1/27](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210127.txt))

[https://nakedshortreport.com/company/GME](https://nakedshortreport.com/company/GME) (pretty plot, though the data are slightly different from the official data given in the links above; both sources confirm that short volume has been > 50% total volume over the last five days, including today)

As an aside, according to that second website, [""if you see  more than 20% of your overall volume initiated short on a daily basis... you may be under \[a naked short\] attack.""](https://nakedshortreport.com/how-to-detect-short-trades) SEC, a little help, please?

In any case, the day before Robinhood and other brokers instituted the restriction on GME share and option buying was the last day that more than ***50%*** of *all GME shares sold* were not sold short. Shorts have been going in even harder on their shorting while they know buying is difficult for us. We win if we hold.

This is pretty definitive that shorts are causing the current crash, and they definitely haven't covered when doing so. It's mathematically impossible for shorts to cover if more than 50% of all shares sold in a day were sold short. Shorts are instead continuing to double down. GME will eventually rise, especially if Cohen and friends give some good news anytime soon (e.g., official company roadmap released, Cohen and friends buying the remaining shares they can, etc.). It will rise regardless of good news because shorts don't want to pay interest forever if a stock trades sideways. And as soon as all of us can buy an unlimited amount again, we can squeeze them once again.

I've shared FINRA data on here before and gotten some questions which have at this point become predictable, so I'm going to answer them below.

# Couldn't shorts open their position and cover by the end of the day?

No, because more than 50% of all shares were sold short, there were not enough shares for them to cover the shares they sold short even if every single share purchased other than a short share today was sold from a long to a short. It's mathematically impossible. They had to add at least around 10% of the total volume each of the last five days to their short position (most days had about 55% of shares sold short (some even more), and 100 - 55 = 45% not sold short; 55 - 45 = 10% more shares sold short than shares sold long). And I know that I bought more over each of the last few days, as did you glorious autists, so it was probably more than 10% of the total volume they were adding per day for each of the last five days.

# The total volume from those websites is less than the day's volume that my broker or another site tells me was traded

Yes, that's because FINRA only records data from specific markets/exchanges, not all of them. Although the total volume is less than what is sold over the entire market, the *ratio* of short sales to total shares sold is representative of the entire market, because they pull from the biggest exchanges. As mentioned above, FINRA is also the highest quality short data; the official bimonthly short data that is published is by FINRA pulling from these same data. These data are accurate.

&#x200B;

Edit to add: I am not a financial analyst and this is not financial advice. Make up your own mind about everything. Also, I am long GME. 

**TLDR:** Shorts have added a retardedly large amount of new short positions over the last five days. Keep holding, don't sell, and when you can buy more buy more. **GME to fucking Orion's belt 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**"|2021-02-02 20:42:41.183949|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_204245.csv|DueDiligence|['GME', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME']|['FINRA', 'SEC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'FINRA', 'I', 'I', 'FINRA', 'FINRA', 'FINRA', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

This is for new people getting intimated by the volume today and seeing it was higher compared to yesterday and are wondering why the price is still down. What happened on open was a decline downwards all the way down to $70-80 running on LITERALLY the same amount of volume yesterday at around 20-30 million, but as it hit $70-$80 you beautiful fuckers 🦍💎 didn’t sell but instead gobbled that shit up all the way to $140 hence the spike in volume. When it went down again to $90 at closing you can see that the volume is also low similar to the decline at open. *Theoretically if they just kept reducing the price and no one bought but held we would have closed lower than $90 and would have definitely closed with close to the same amount of volume as yesterday*. I feel like people are missing the fact that it didn’t just go down in price it also went up.

I am unable to use emojis off my laptop so please excuse me for not having enough rocket ships but I promise you this rocket ship is fueling up and we are a couple months away from blast off if not sooner.

Why should you trust me?

I am an economics major with a concentration in entrepreneurship and a minor in sales. I love money more than hookers love blow and I intend on making a lot of money so I can afford the hookers that like blow. I go to a pretty prestigious university and I love how WallStreetBets can connect ""smart"" money with ""autist"" money. I am 100% all in on APHA with my entire life savings because as Warren Buffett would say, "" ""**Diversification** is a protection against ignorance,"" ""\[It\] makes very little sense for those who know what they're doing.""  and I know what I am doing so I full sent it.

&#x200B;

Why APHA?

They are conservative with their spending is what got me hooked first. Compared to other marijuana companies like ACB or Tilray, they aren't riddled with debt right off the back. (i'll get to the Tilray merger in a bit). This company has the cash on hand to purchase a MSO (multi-state operator) as soon as the US legalizes and my bet is that they are going to go for a MSO that has a heavy presence in Florida as the CFO stated in an AMA on reddit that Florida is where the market is, not California. The difference between APHA and any MSO or other LP is the fact that APHA merging with Tilray creates the first MCO or Multi-country operator. This means the company will be taking a piece of the cake from multiple cakes. You don't need to be #1 in America or Canada whenever you are directly engaged in multiple operations all over the world that increase your market share to be #1 worldwide.

&#x200B;

With APHA and Tilray merging... which stonk do you buy? Easy, APHA.

The arbitrage play has APHA being changed to .83 of 1 Tilray share.

Currently tilray trades at 24.95 x 0.83 = 20.708

The current APHA price? 15.25.

This means that the gap has to close before the merger but is Tilray going to go down with all the pro marijuana news coming out? No, APHA has to go up to close the gap and today alone APHA is up 17.92% based on pro marijuana legalization news. BUT WAIT! Tilray is up 22.98% which means the GAP IS ONLY GETTING WIDER just like your wife's pussy after letting her 5 boyfriends have a turn since you've been so busy focusing on your GME stonk going down due to market manipulation.

&#x200B;

The financials of APHA are strong, they FINALLY posted a profit of 0.01 EPS which may seem like little bitch shit but in reality most cannabis companies haven't hit profitability yet so they are ahead of the game. The one great thing about their financials is that Sweetwater Brewing wasn't factored into the earnings report which is AWESOME (Insert hellllaaa rocket emojis here). They are already turning a profit and THEN they are going to be adding more profits from a brewery that has strong revenue growth and turns a profit onto their balance sheet. While other companies have to figure out how to keep demand up after the holiday season, APHA has a raft to float on since Sweetwater provides a great level of float to the company. (I will post all relevant news articles at the end). The merge with Tilray makes this combined company a player in, Canada, Portugal, France, and then Sweetwater gives them US brand recognition. How does a beer company give US brand recognition? Look up the Sweetwater brand and you will see that this is a beer company for stoners and that is exactly what APHA needed. Right now the stock is stilling at $15 which is still relatively low, I can see this hitting anywhere from $50-75 EOY and like I said, I have my entire life savings in this stonk because I know the end of prohibition means the chance for the next Anheuser Busch which APHA is best positioned to become.

There's even more reasons to invest but I'm sure you get the point. This is going to be huge and if you're looking for a play in the marijuana sector this is your best option. Go on the weedstocks subreddit if you want even more verification or to see some alternative opinions. I made this post as a throwback to the good ole days to when WSB wasn't only about GME and AMC but also new emerging sectors. This is a great stock and I wouldn't have taken the time out of my busy schedule unless the time to blast off was fast approaching. Listen or don't I am gonna make tendies, I just want to share the wealth.

Sweetwater is actually a very big deal that is overlooked. They are expanding into more states which is simply creating a distribution chain for APHA/Tilray to distribute their product through. Imagine already having warehouses, sales reps, and shipping routes established before the US legalizes. APHA is going to be an MSO and MCO. The only thing that scares me is that democrats have said they don't want big companies coming in to sweep up market share whenever minorities have been directly impacted by the war on drugs. Could go both ways but Sweetwater provides somewhat of a foundation for the balance sheet and then the intrinsic value of the relationships/brand recognition that will already be established before any other LPs can get into the market will have APHA/Tilray the clear cut winner of the LPs. I strongly urge anyone that wants to get further into the marijuana investing space to visit the sub reddit Weedstocks rather than spamming WSB with these types of posts whenever their is a different sub dedicated to it. I have been a member of WSB and Weedstocks for over a year and both subs have their pros and cons.

What comes to mind when you think of BlackBerry? Phones? Your a chump if you answered phones.

TLDR up front, BlackBerry has pivoted away from making phones and instead is in the software sector. Some big names that they have include, [SpaceX](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=0&article=1737&context=smallsat&type=additional), [Amazon](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/blackberry-and-amazon-web-services-partner-on-ivy-tech-for-your-car/), **Nvidia**, **NIO**, **Xpeng**, **Ford** and 19 out of the 25 EV companies now use QNX. (*New info as of 2/2/21 at bottom*)

**Software**

BlackBerry has gone away from the phones business and has reinvented itself to become the main player in Automobile OS systems. They have lock and key in this market since many OEMs don't want to start from the ground up making the software themselves. As of June,2020 they have the QNS software in over[175 million cars](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-175-million-vehicles-301081594.html). Nvidia uses BlackBerries QNX for the base of its [self-driving car](https://channeldailynews.com/news/nvidia-to-build-its-ai-self-driving-platform-on-blackberry-qnx/58048). Sony is also partners with Nvidia and BlackBerry for the car they are [making.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/) Not to mention the companies that use QNX are subscription based, so reoccurring revenue. This is speculation on this part but Hyundai is using QNX and has partnered with Apple, and carplay is a layer built on QNX.

**Fundamentals**

BlackBerry recently just sold all of there phone [patents](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-sells-90-patents-to-huawei-covering-key-smartphone/) to Huawai showing that they are no longer in the phone sector. Big Boys have been adding more BB to there pockets and the last 13F was on the 15th (1/15/21) (Fin---tel)

[https://gyazo.com/d9894e59a75885c1506dd3a2ef576ebe](https://gyazo.com/d9894e59a75885c1506dd3a2ef576ebe) 

I had pictures to show it but the braindead bot removed it.

Other big short inst---itutions have a hard on for keeping this low, BB was in the top 20 most shorted stocks but GME was number 1. Just this Friday(1/15) Shorts and inst---itutions sold alot.

The **50 dayMA crossed the 200dayMA** in December and has held since then. Also check out that 188million green.

Morningstar and CFRA both put $BB with a fair value price of 6.40, so you can assume that is the absolute bottom. (copied from [u/ThegreatLoudini](https://www.reddit.com/u/ThegreatLoudini/))

Black Berry Call volume is [exceedingly high](https://twitter.com/ACInvestorBlog/status/1356314928446103554?s=09) this month, possible that the big boys know something?

I know short term meme stocks seem to be all the rage these days, but I believe the real tendies are being produced from the cannabis sector. 

MSOS (Cannabis ETF) is up 6% today and has already gone up \~25% on the year. Basically all the cannabis stocks have been exploding these past few months. I don't see this growth slowly down anytime soon and here are some reasons why.

* Both the **US and Mexico** are closing in on **federally legalizing cannabis**. Both of these countries are going to offer huge markets that will combine to be far bigger than Canada's current market.
* **More people are doing the 420**. Usage is going up everywhere and I don't see it dropping in the near future.
* Lots of cannabis companies are **getting majorly shorted** which is keeping their stock price down instead of going to the MOOOON 🚀🚀

Wouldn't be a fair DD without some risks though.....

* Although **US and Mexico** are strongly considering federal legalization, it **could still go south**. Backlash from legalizing or more important and pressing issues could easily push it to the back-burner or kill the idea all together for the near future.
* Although many health studies are coming out listing the benefits of cannabis, if some **serious health side-effects** come out in some studies it could scare people away from smoking the weed.
* There are far too many companies and lots of them are going to go **bankrupt** probably. Lots of room to get unlucky in your choices.

So what cannabis stonks should I be YOLOing into? A better first question might be: What should I be looking for in a cannabis stock?.

* **Profitable or near it:** Once the market really explodes it is going to be the companies with the cleanest balance sheets that are going to be able to make the big moves and print the real tendies. The companies with piles of debt and minimal profit will be left in the dust.
* **Has a foothold in multiple countries:** The more countries, states, licenses, land, etc., the better. All of these will allow for a head-start in the markets in that area.
* **Undervalued:** with lots of the cannabis stocks getting shorted to death, there are some cannabis stocks out there that I believe are extremely undervalued.

So what are your recommendations Mr. Smooth Brain?

* **APHA:** Tilray and Aphria are in the works of a serious and huge merger that will see them becoming one of (if not the biggest) cannabis company. Aphria's financials continue to be promising and Tilray's are not as solid but still decent. Aphria also acquired SweatWater giving them a solid start on cannabis related beverages. Aphria is the largest cannabis producer in Canada at 12.2% ([source](https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235)).  
So why APHA and not TLRY? When APHA and TLRY merge APHA shares will be .83 of a TLRY share. Because of this it is safe to assume APHA share price should = 0.83 x TLRY share price. TLRY share price is currently $25 which would mean that APHA share price should be around $20. For this reason APHA price being $15 right now is a steal assuming the merger goes through (looking promising for the merger to happen in Q2 this year).  

* **FIRE.TO/SPRWF:** I know what you are thinking.... ""this gay boomer bear smooth brain thinks a penny stock is a good idea!?!"".... hear me out. Supreme cannabis is one of those companies that never quite reached potential in the initial Canadian cannabis boom. Never had a real profitable quarter and has since been crushed to the ground by shorts ([source](https://shortdata.ca/stock/FIRE.TO/)). It has mostly been treated as just a dead stock and over the last few months people have dumbed on me for even mentioning this stock.  
I believe this is all about to turn around though. Supreme is having an earnings call on February 11th where I expect an extremely promising financial report and exciting upcoming news. Considering how undervalued this stock is (97 million market cap) it isn't going to take much to get this stock exploding. Volume and shorts have been exploding in this stock which shows huge promise. Supreme also makes up 3% of cannabis retail market in Canada ([source](https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235)). They also have connections in Australia and Israel markets.  


There are many more promising cannabis stonks out there and I encourage my fellow smooth brains to do their DD. Companies operating in multiple states are a safe bet ([check out this](https://www.greenmarketreport.com/the-cannabis-industrys-top-12-u-s-multi-state-operators/)). Also large companies like Canopy Growth, Curaleaf, etc. should all be decent stocks. If you are a retard interested in penny stocks check out FAF.TO and HITIF (along with SPRWF of course). 

Lots are coming out with earnings in the next few weeks, so keep your eyes out and remember to exercise those  💎🙌

My positions: APHA 20@$7, SPRWF 4480@$0.13, (I know... r/babystreetbets)..... I plan on dumping more into APHA and doubling down on SPRWF after earnings come out.

A lot of retards made their first trade with GME. Awesome and welcome!

With inexperience come a lot of psychological phallacies that Funds are exploiting:

# BUY LOW SELL HIGH.

*The. Core. Principal. Of. Trading.*

You never, ever sell when down. You don't. If you sell at loss you're literally **BUYING HIGH AND SELLING LOW!!!** If you don't 100% NEED this money RIGHT FUCKING NOW. Do. Not. Sell. It would be more entertaining literally burning money then selling at artificially low prices. NO ONE IS FORCING YOU TO SELL. If you're getting nervous about LOSSES ----> DONT LOOK AT THE STOCK. DELETE YOUR APP. DO NOT GET STRESSED AND EMOTIONAL. You are not acting rationally when emotions get involved in trading. NEVER SELL EMOTIONALLY. Emotions are your enemy in trading and you WILL LOSE MONEY. If you're emotionally attached to your invested money, try avoiding any further trades until you're set up where you can (emergency fund, tax advantaged accounts etc. can help you feeling more secure).

It's negative today, it may be negative tomorrow. The DD still stands. GME as a company is in the spotlight of the world. It has a future.

Even if there will be no short squeeze. DO NOT SELL AT LOSS. WAIT. 1 year, 3 years, 10 years. WHATEVER. It can get green again. IT CAN AND IT MAY. If you sell at loss, it wont.

I KNOW THIS IS NO TYPICAL WSB (NON) ADVICE, BUT WITH SO MANY FUCKING RETARDS JUMPING IN WITH NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT THEIR DOING IT NEEDS TO BE SAID.

Some more autistic shit

# Percieved Value:

Remember when you bought your shares. Let's say you bought at $300. You made the decision that this stock, its potential and emotional value, is worth $300 to you and you bought.

Now the Price is artificially driven down. The beginning value hasn't changed. No one says that stock is worth less, unless you do. Unless you yourself decide that you're willing to sell at a lower price.

When selling at $100 -> YOU ARE SAYING IT'S WORTH THIS LITTLE. YOU DECIDE AT WHAT PRICE YOU'RE WILLING TO SELL. If you don't WANT to sell at $100 WAIT TILL YOU CAN SELL IT TO FUCKING MELVIN AT $6000.

Plus: Loss Aversion

A loss of 10% is emotionally more powerfull than a gain of 10%. They are preying on this effect to bring you to make an emotional decision to PANIC and sell at loss. WHICH ONLY MAKES SENSE IF YOUR GOAL IS TO LOSE MONEY.

&#x200B;

HOLD TODAY

HOLD TOMORROW

HOLD FOREVER

IF YOU NEED THE MONEY, WAIT FOR IT TO FUCKING TURN GREEN YOU IMBECILE.

&#x200B;

THIS IS JUST A DELUSIONAL AUTISTIC FUCK SPEAKING AND NO FINANCIAL ADVICE.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

Since WSB became a fucked up game of finding an imposter -> I was active on WSB a while ago on a different account (MICRON, early AMD) and since moved to subs like /r/financialindependence /r/FIRE etc. and switched to low-cost index funds and mainly stick to this kind of investments and kept an eye on WSB for enterntainment. This account has since been deleted by me because friends of mine (and coworkers) got ahold of that accounts username. I had some history that was too personal for them to know about.

I only moved onto the GME bandwagon out of spite, the moment BUY's got blocked on RH. This is the only and last ""WSB"" move I'm gonna do. 

It doesn't have any meaning as I could write whatever, but my username is my job in the banking sector. I know people that work in HF's, used to work decades in HF's. I didn't quite believe what they told me about the possibilities they have. But now I do.

Buy low, sell high is the foundation of any trade you do. Even GME. 

If you thought this move would be a quick buck over a few days, no. If you bought after the surge, it just doesn't make ANY sense selling. NONE. You cut your potential of any breakeven, ever.

Even if the short squeeze wouldn't happen due to highly illegal tactics by HF, GameStop has way more potential now than before. The company is in international spotlight, has an easy way to raise capital after the trade still, has global logistics... It still has potential as a company, if you sell now, you lose out on any chance of ever covering that loss."|2021-02-02 20:42:41.183949|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_204245.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['A', 'GME', 'BUY', 'LOW', 'SELL', 'HIGH', 'UYING', 'HIGH', 'AND', 'LLING', 'LOW', 'NEED', 'RIGHT', 'CKING', 'NOW', 'NO', 'ONE', 'IS', 'RCING', 'YOU', 'TO', 'SELL', 'OSSES', 'DONT', 'LOOK', 'AT', 'THE', 'STOCK', 'ELETE', 'YOUR', 'APP', 'DO', 'NOT', 'GET', 'ESSED', 'AND', 'IONAL', 'NEVER', 'SELL', 'NALLY', 'WILL', 'LOSE', 'MONEY', 'DD', 'GME', 'DO', 'NOT', 'SELL', 'AT', 'LOSS', 'WAIT', 'TEVER', 'IT', 'CAN', 'AND', 'IT', 'MAY', 'I', 'KNOW', 'THIS', 'IS', 'NO', 'PICAL', 'WSB', 'DVICE', 'BUT', 'WITH', 'SO', 'MANY', 'CKING', 'TARDS', 'MPING', 'IN', 'WITH', 'NO', 'CKING', 'CLUE', 'WHAT', 'THEIR', 'DOING', 'IT', 'NEEDS', 'TO', 'BE', 'SAID', 'YOU', 'ARE', 'AYING', 'S', 'WORTH', 'THIS', 'ITTLE', 'YOU', 'ECIDE', 'AT', 'WHAT', 'PRICE', 'RE', 'LLING', 'TO', 'SELL', 'WANT', 'WAIT', 'TILL', 'YOU', 'CAN', 'SELL', 'IT', 'TO', 'CKING', 'ELVIN', 'AT', 'A', 'PANIC', 'WHICH', 'ONLY', 'MAKES', 'SENSE', 'IF', 'YOUR', 'GOAL', 'IS', 'TO', 'LOSE', 'MONEY', 'HOLD', 'TODAY', 'HOLD', 'ORROW', 'HOLD', 'REVER', 'IF', 'YOU', 'NEED', 'THE', 'MONEY', 'WAIT', 'FOR', 'IT', 'TO', 'CKING', 'TURN', 'GREEN', 'YOU', 'ECILE', 'THIS', 'IS', 'JUST', 'A', 'IONAL', 'ISTIC', 'FUCK', 'AKING', 'AND', 'NO', 'NCIAL', 'DVICE', 'WSB', 'I', 'WSB', 'ICRON', 'FIRE', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'RH', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'ANY', 'NONE', 'HF']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'RH', 'GME']

I used Python to download Yahoo! Finance's data via their Python package (source code at the bottom to plot out all volume and short interest).  


Here is why I think selling is terrible:  
Looking at the current week, we see a lot of puts below the $100 strike price:

[Yeah so what?](https://preview.redd.it/wu2mxamgr5f61.png?width=1783&format=png&auto=webp&s=880716c405c8dccea70a7397efee84bbae895d4a)

This seems obvious but why does that matter? Well it means people are betting this will go down, and not just below $100, but a lot of them are betting it will go down to sub $30 levels! We also have ton of people thinking it will skyrocket to $800 as seen in some other posts (do with this what you will).

This seems like a pretty bearish outlook and doesn't give much hope, but take a look at the following week:

[That confident?](https://preview.redd.it/1dmkly46s5f61.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6077ec26ad476c234ba9dfa2dc617cd05e97452)

Everyone thinks GME is now worth less than $30 less than 1-week later. That is some horseshit if I ever smelled it. I am not one to believe in conspiracy theories and neither should you, but if I were short GME right now, I am betting GME will die come next Monday. 

After all that initial DD and GME's positive long term outlook, people are betting 3,000,000 shares GME is basically going bankrupt.

This is and always has been a long play IMO. GameStop isn't going anywhere anytime soon and if you think it is such a bad company that it will fall to sub-$30 levels than give those shares up to people who believe in this companies transformation and PERSEVERANCE through the years and through COVID.

Positions: 250 @ $240 and holding not because why not, but because this company is actually good. I will buy more after my funds clear.

1. Send instructions to your brokerage firm to mail out GME certificates to your home 

2. Sell covered calls slightly higher than the market price for your AMC, BB or any other stonk you own 

3. Use the income from the covered calls to buy more GME stock, if you like the stock and have those sent home. 

4. Order a game from game stop before the end of the day, because they sell great games. Get someone to help you with the math if you can't figure out what happens next. Real diamond hands sleep with their certificates under their pillow.

Listen up retards,

Many of you are probably looking for a new direction from which tendies may fly. Well do I have a solution for you. It’s a big reverse course from the boomer dinner this sub ate over the past few weeks.

Yes my friends, I propose aggressive call options/long positions on the Airline industry, specifically Delta. Here’s why:

Past:

\- Going back to a report by Forbes, [Delta ranks best](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurabegleybloom/2020/07/27/covid-report-best-worst-airlines-coronavirus/?sh=48b3b5ff13af) in terms of cleanliness during COVID, meaning prevailing sentiment among travelers is high right now.

Present:

\- Delta is the [last major airline not filling middle seats](https://news.delta.com/delta-only-us-airline-block-middle-seats-limit-onboard-capacity-through-march-30-2021#:~:text=Delta%20will%20continue%20delivering%20on,now%20through%20March%2030%2C%202021), thereby spacing passengers out. 

\- This is good because, again it improves customer safety/feeling of safety during flights

\- This also means that they have been seating fewer passengers throughout the pandemic, while total profits have remained largely equal with their major competitors

\- Tighter self-imposed restrictions may mean fewer international restrictions, but this is more speculative than anything

Future:

\- Expects to hit profitability by July

\- Pandemic expense cuts to older aircraft should present a $400m decrease to annual costs, even when considering a ramp up in overhead as traffic increases

\- Delta expects at least 70% of their large corporate clients to return by the end of the year

Those final 2 points are from their last earning call, which means… well of course theyd be bullish on themselves, but if its to be believed, then Delta is ready to come out of the pandemic strong. With a mix of leisure travel skyrocketing, business travel returning to some extent, and the holidays leading to a traffic spike right in time for Jan 2022 calls, I’m thinking of going hog deep in 65c at $1.61 a piece.

My main price suppressing factor is that [children aren't expected to receive the COVID Vaccine](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/children-coronavirus-vaccine-late-2021-experts/story?id=73364817) until late 2021. If children can’t get the vaccine then families cannot travel. I'm banking a lot here on the vast majority of Americans getting the vaccine in time for Christmas. As a result my theory leads me to the Jan 2022 options, rather than the Sep ones, as the holiday rush will play out before they expire.

TLDR:

Plane no fly good now, but stock not so bad. When plane fly more, stock more better."|2021-02-02 20:42:41.183949|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_204247.csv|DueDiligence|['DD']|[]|['I', 'I', 'COVID', 'COVID']|[]

Feb 5 100p had the highest volume today at 22k with 7k OI, call volumes don't even compare. Like it or not in general people are bearish on the stock and the fact that 100P is now pretty deep ITM doesn't bode well for the stock. What we are experiencing is pretty much a gamma squeeze but downwards. 

That halt today was pretty bullshit because we were on the way up above 100  and an IV crush on OTM $100 puts would've given us some momentum upward. But no it just had to happen on the way up. 

Anyways this week looks pretty bearish and it is possible we could dump some more if we don't take back 100. I've been wrong before and I hope I'm wrong again. Keep diamond handing though, MM has been fucking with us by jacking up the price of options to make it harder for us to buy and profit from this. They can't do this forever and in fact, I've been profiting by selling OTM puts at great prices while holding onto my shares, I know theta gang isn't welcome here but what could be better than getting paid to hold gme at discount prices? or selling puts to expire worthless to GME bears?

The interest rate on your shorts goes through the roof and you are about to go bankrupt. What do you do? First you up your fire power by bringing in funds. Then you vilify your enemies, telling the world that they are the problem, not you. Then you stop the squeeze by putting a throttle on demand side. Then you divert the money to side show securities that will actually raise your bottom line.  


What next? You still have to pay back the shares. You are not going to get it cheap. How do we limit it? I could buy cheap way OTM call options knowing that when we start to cover, the price is going to explode because the diamond handed apes won't be selling for cheap. How do you maximize this? 

1) you need a cheap OTM call. Since 2 weeks ago, the highest call was 160, and last week was 320, they weren't far enough out of the money to be cheap. 

2) to make it cheaper, you need it to look like the squeeze has squoze, and gain as many shares from paper hands on the way down. Lowering the price per share on the call options. 

3) purchase enough OTM calls to cover your short position after it explodes. Locking in your price to cover at 800 per share max.   


Proof:   
[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options/)  
Here we can see that there is a volume of 28,493 call options purchased. Holy shit...

That is 2.85 million shares. 2.28 Billion dollars worth at that strike price. 

With the volume of trades as it rises to that point, plus the volume of those calls, they could bring their short positions low enough to complete the squeeze.  


Who is left holding the bag? HF will mostly hold the bag. Seeing as they will be paying 2.28 Billion dollars at least. Then the real bag holders will be the writers of the call options. They will have to purchase the shares raising the price above 800 due to a gamma squeeze. 

TL;DR: I believe hedge funds have gotten rid of their risk of having to pay the 10k per share we think is reasonable to a max of 800 by purchasing way out of the money calls, and writers of call options will be the biggest bag holders in history.

First off, to all of you diamond handing this stock, god damn I love you apes.

Now listen up and listen closely. GME is still on a moon mission and its launch is imminent. I've seen some fantastic DD here that is far beyond my analytical skills and I thank you all for that because god knows I can't read so the charts help.

This break down is going to be consist of something we tend to lack here, and that my friends, is logic.

So lets get into it. 

This past week has seen GME hit an ATH followed by a steep decline due to market manipulation tactics and the media turning against us at presumably the hand of the hedge funds we stand to hurt the most. We have seen hit pieces on GME, misdirection, and blatant lies regarding the analytics and reporting of statistics on GME. Countless media outlets have claimed that GME has squeezed already and its over! Its done! Move on and move back in with your wife's boyfriend!

But they are wrong.

Think of this from a surface level and look at the big picture. This entire week was a setup for shorts to mitigate their losses which they knew they would incur regardless. First, we saw a price spike that opened up options far, far OTM.  Out to 800 fucking dollar calls. Then, we saw a steep decline in price along with a fundraiser for shorts in the form of SLV being pushed by shills. Following this we saw massive purchases of these OTM 800c yesterday once premiums and IV were reduced. So what does this mean? Hedges set themselves up to mitigate how much they'll lose in hopes of just avoiding bankruptcy while giving their associates a chance to profit even greater on the impending squeeze. 

Now why would it come this week if a lot of the calls are dated out to March you ask? Apparently, and I don't know this for fact, but Fintel will update GME's short interest officially as of next Tuesday, February 9th. If this is true, and short interest is still over 100%, this will confirm that media outlets were bought and paid for by hedges along with their misdirection, thus causing even further public outrage, and another mass buying of GME to get in on the squeeze that is still coming. 

However, if hedges knock the price down as far as possible and trigger the squeeze this week, they will have effectively hedged their bets with calls, shaken out as many paper hands as possible, and stopped delaying the inevitable, all while leaving the media outlets they paid off, now holding the metaphorical bag of lost public trust, all while mitigating their losses to the fullest extent. 

Essentially, if the short interest is still outstanding and above 100%, shorts would fuck themselves even further by allowing an official report of this to come out and they know it. 

We go the moon soon my fellow apes. Good luck and God speed. See you at 10,000.

This is NOT financial advice and I AM and APE.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Hedges have mitigated their losses and have screwed buyers and the media outlets they've bought. When official short interest reports come out, they'll be outed as liars and the retail retaliation will send us even further to the moon than if they just let it happen prior to these reports."|2021-02-02 20:42:41.183949|../output/raw/2021/02/02/DueDiligence_flair_DD_204245.csv|DueDiligence|['GME', 'THIS']|['GME']|['TDLR', 'I', 'GME', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'ATH', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'OTM', 'SLV', 'OTM', 'IV', 'I', 'GME', 'NOT', 'I', 'AM', 'APE']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

And I'm still holding, haven't dropped a single share. I'm not trying marginalize or kill morale but something needs to change.

&#x200B;

That's fucking AWESOME that DFV is still in and is holding with his diamond dong, but first things first, he cashed out $13M along the way and has been very transparent on this. What's losing $20M if you're up $40M? 

&#x200B;

DFV is why a lot of retail investors entered the market. DFV never intended for this to hit as high as it did and that's apparent in his positions, he thought GME was heavily shorted and had a lot of potential, but there's no way he thought it would lead to short squeeze 1k+ territory. 

HE IS NOT THE NUMBERS BEHIND THIS AND ""I"" NEED TO THINK FOR MYSELF

""I"" need to stop making him a martyr for this sub for the day he eventually sells. The SEC is probably watching him like a hawk and I'm assuming that's a big reason that he's still in even though it's in his long play. 

&#x200B;

Also the SWEEPING DOGSHIT MORALE needs to stop. This sub went from 

&#x200B;

"" BUY BUY BUY BUY EVERYONE BUY""

""Wow everyone here has such high expectations you shouldn't be taking this unsatirically and you should only afford to play with what you lose."" ""Here's a gambling hotline"" ""Wow what a dumb play""

Given the massive red days we've seen twice this week I'd really recommend giving it a read. But the one point that's important, and point of this post is:

* Cohen still has a contract to buy another 7% of Shares

He currently owns around 13%, and is restricted to owning no more than 20% as part of an agreement. Obviously he wouldn't want to exercise that right when the price is $350, and he has until the end of 2022 to do it, but if he thinks $100 is the new Floor, or around there, wouldn't this be the best time for him to do so?

Every single one of his share purchases in the past have been about sending a message. Why not this one too?

You're all shouting Wall St is preventing the MOASS through manipulative actions (they definitely are). However you're all losing sight of why the short squeeze was even possible in the first place and pissing your pants wetting your paper hands in the process.

**We didn't invest in GME because the shorts were over 140% of the float and wanted to punish Wall St**

If any of you autists actually did some DD or even watched some of DFV's videos, you'll realize that GME was a value play, *the short squeeze was just the cherry on top*. I have seen over the past two weeks, a huge gaslighting effort from billionaires on TV (and unintentionally reddit users pushing only the MOASS), getting you to believe that Gamestop's value is from the short squeeze. What everyone forgot is how valuable of a company Gamestop is now.

**So what changed about Gamestop?**

In Nov 2020 Ryan fking Cohen joined Gamestop's Board. Who is Ryan Cohen? This is the guy who built Chewy from the ground up, he was in all respects, able to build a Pet e-commerce empire and directly compete with **Amazon**. Not only did Ryan join the board, but he was able to bring along with him Chewy's COO/CMO and CFO. You know who else is on the board? Reggie Fils-Aimé, the previous President of Nintendo Americas. If you don't know Reggie, you definitely know his face. So now you know Gamestop is poised for a shakeup, Ryan didn't join the Board and bring with him two other people because he thought Gamestop was going to get squozed, he did it because he understands there is a lot of money to be made here.

**Valuation**

I'm not going to pretend I'm an expert in valuing companies. Properly evaluating a company purely based on financials does not work in today's market anymore, but to appease the F people.

Here are some facts:

Critics argue brick and mortar retail, and as a result Gamestop, is dying. While they aren't wrong, they fail to also address that Gamestop had **300% YoY growth in e-commerce sales**. Gamestop is also actively shutting down stores and rebranding existing ones as experience centers. Physical Gamestop stores are going to be where all you autists hang out when you're outside of your rooms.

Gaming is huge, anyone who argues otherwise is living under a rock. As cringe as it was, Ninja hosting the NYC ball drop is testament to this. Singular game titles like Fortnite and Minecraft are worth billions alone. The gaming industry itself is worth nearly **$200 Billion** and slated to grow double digits YoY.

[There is a great DD written by a VC on why Gamestop is going to the moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/)

>This market cap (matching industry standards) should for an appropriate valuation for a growth stock be $50B.....This is why the short squeeze is distracting many. In 5 years if you diamond hands this company, the fair value of shares can range from $800-$2400 and not be in any sort of bubble or unjustified by fundamentals speculation.

To repeat that, based on fundamentals alone (nothing to do with a short squeeze), GME per share could be worth $800 conservatively, or $50 Billion. Chewy at this time is worth roughly $40 Billion in a smaller market, Pet products vs Gaming.

So polish your paper hands and turn them into fking diamonds. There is nothing Wall St can do can make you sell. And when this company starts turning itself around, you'll have been at the ground floor. 

**TL:DR Gamestop not worth nothing if shorts not squoze. Everyone wants you to believe it so you can sell now. Gaming is huge, Gamestop is positioning itself to be big.** 

P.S. For all you retards, everyday you hold your shares is another day Melvin and co need to pay interest. Hold your stocks for at least a year, and you even get to pay long term capital gains tax as opposed to short term counts as ordinary income. (Read hold onto your shares for longer, less booboo from govt).

Due to the massive losses to the hedges. Why wouldn’t a couple of hedges. Once they have covered. Start massively going long in order to start a massive squeeze to get rid of all the other hedges that are still short. (Still a large short interest) It would only take a small push I think from some big hedges to kickstart the perpetual upward rise.  Retail would join in. The whales are already in.  They would then bail when the squeeze is sqoze and their competition is gone. 

Why would they do this. 
1. It gets rid of the competition 
2. It minimises their losses from the previous shorts. If done right it could actually make them profit. 

Why wouldn’t they do this
1. It would make retail think they won and were right.  Cant have the little guy declaring victory. Is pride more important than money to these despicable miscreants. 

If this is correct then those holding could be rewarded by the hedges.  It would also explain why there was $25m in $800 3/19 calls.

Gotta combat some of this shit.

I keep seeing so many posts around here about this squeeze and that the 2008 VW squeeze are totally the same. Or that in 2008 the VW squeeze happened with a much smaller short position. 

They are not the same full stop and the VW squeeze didn't have a smaller short position.

First and foremost I'm holding 9 shares at an avg cost of $352.00 I'm still in it but all the shit DD needs to stop. 

Sorry if this hurts your feelings.

So first and foremost just because they are both short squeezes does not mean they are going to behave the same. Part of the reason for this is the suprise and speed at which the VW squeeze happened to funds.

Second and the main part of this post. The short position was not actually smaller in VW. I'll explain. 

In 2008 the VW short squeeze happened causing VW to become the most valued company on the entire NYSE. The reason for this situation is similar to the current situation there were more shorts out than shares to cover. 

Now I already hear your stupid screeching ""BUT IS WAS ONLY 12 PERCENT SHORT!!!""

Now I'm sure you had to kick off your shoes and socks to count that high and really I'm proud but here is the whole story.

Porsche had quietly bought nearly 75% of the company. This was done in a few sneaky ways but ultimately that's what happened.

Now before this there were only 45% of the shares available anyways due to Porsche having an existing 30% stake various index funds 5% and finally 20% covered by the german government.

To break it down 30+20+5 = 55% already owned. and 13 percent or so short.

Now let's add in Porsche's new stake 75+20+5=95%

And since these shares are now bought by people who have no interest or in some cases no ability to sell we there is a 13% short position on only about 5% of trading shares.

The final catalist was VW issuing a statement to the shorts letting them know they were super duper fucked. Like you forgot to pick up your wife's birth control and now your rasing her boyfriends son levels of fucked.

This caused the short squeeze from hell.

Now as to our current dilemma. Nothing is guaranteed to behave the same however if the shorts have not closed their positions sufficiently this might happen again. So good news for we big dick diamond hand fuckers if that is the case. But anyone who this is your first time at this shit know that you might be about to learn a painful fucking lesson that just because 2 similar things happen it doesn't mean shit.

That being said HOLD THE FUCKING LINE AND BUY THE DIPS"|2021-02-03 09:10:15.755295|../output/raw/2021/02/03/DueDiligence_flair_DD_091019.csv|DueDiligence|['VW', 'GME']|['GME']|['I', 'VW', 'VW', 'VW', 'DD', 'VW', 'VW', 'VW', 'VW', 'NYSE', 'I', 'BUT', 'IS', 'WAS', 'ONLY', 'RCENT', 'SHORT', 'VW', 'HOLD', 'THE', 'CKING', 'LINE', 'AND', 'BUY', 'THE']|[]

Listen up retards,

I know BlAcKbErRy make phones is a solid meme, but I think it is actually a very worthwhile investment regardless of the current hype (or lack thereof) around the stock.

BlackBerry Spark was launched just earlier last year and so far is winning some decent contracts. I think it has plenty of room to grow. As governments and countries start to connect more with the internet due to covid or just technology advancing cybersecurity solutions will be more relevant. I think BB has positioned itself to be a solid choice.

The United States Airforce in September selected BlackBerry Spark “for their secure productivity needs.”

Samsung Knox uses BlackBerry Spark

They “won” the patent infringement lawsuit against Facebook, so that payout should be coming at some point. I know the stock already jumped because of the news, but still being able to uphold their patents means in the future they can sue more people for infringement and make more money.

Blackberry is out of the cell phone game which is good for them I think their software and security was really what made the phones popular to begin with so now they can focus more on that. (Also they are the largest patent holders in Canada not sure if that a really that important though)

While I don’t think its going to be the rocketship I wanted it to be (I wanted it to be one so bad look at my comment history lol)  I do think it’s a sound investment and if you buy now you can earn some tidy profits. Earnings call is March 3rd so you autists can buy options for that Friday

But Im just a retarded ape so what do I know.

Edit: they have also partnered with Zoom. There is also a blackberry branded 5g phone coming out. (Blackberry isn't the company making it)

*Redefining gaming, eSports, and streaming*

Company Overview

Corsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California.

They acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market, Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom-built PC systems and console controllers markets, respectively, and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam, and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market.

Corsair went public on September 23, 2020, with its IPO priced at $17, valuing the company at about $1.3B.

Understanding the Business

**Value Proposition**

Corsair provides specialized, high-performance gear for gamers and streamers. Their products are designed to provide speed and reliability for competitive gaming, high quality content for streamers, and powerful PC components that allows gamers to run modern games smoothly.

**Revenue Streams**

Currently, Corsair groups its product offering into two segments: gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems.

Gamer and Creator Peripherals:

which represents around 25% of net revenue, includes gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets, streaming gear, and high performance console controllers.

Gaming Components Systems:

which represents around 75% of net revenue includes computer cases, power supply units (PSU), high performance memory products (40% of net revenue), and custom-built gaming systems.

Acquisitions and Partnerships:

During 3Q 2020 Corsair acquired Gamer Sensei, a gaming coaching platform, EpocCam, an app that allows iPhones to serve as a webcam, and partnered with Pipeline, a course-based education platform for streamers.

Industry

**Market Size**

According to Jon Peddie Research, the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach $40B by the end of 2020. Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.

Additionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.

**Industry Fundamentals**

Growth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.

Popularity of gaming is increasing:

According to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.

Tech-driven improvements in game quality:

Advances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.

Increasing gaming and streaming engagement:

Some interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks’ State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:

* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games
* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves
* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive
* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.

**The eSports and streaming flywheel**

The rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.

Competitive Landscape & Risks

**Competition**

The gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair’s product offering includes:

**Gaming keyboards and mice** \- Logitech and Razer

**Headsets and related audio products** \-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX

**Streaming gear** \- Logitech and AVerMedia

**Performance controllers** \- Microsoft and Logitech

**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake

**High performance memory** \- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron

**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower

**Competitive Strategy**

The company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.

**Market Share**

According to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.

**Growth Strategy**

Move into the Asia Pacific region:

The Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.

Complimentary acquisitions:

Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.

New Markets:

Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.

**Threat of New Entrants**

Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).

**Threat of Substitution**

A significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair’s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.

Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user’s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.

According to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.

Additionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.

**Moats**

There does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair’s market share across their product offering.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

[Here is a blog entry](https://stu2b50.dev/posts/why-robinhood-d3580b) attempting to explain the calculation.

As far as I understand, the situation is like this.  RH needs to maintain an amount of cash (maybe with DTCC, but possibly just separately within RH since they have their own clearing house) that, with 99% probability, will cover the entirety of the cash needed to cover their unsettled T+2 positions.  This is generally much smaller than the actual buy volume on a given day because the amount that's due two days later is max(vol_buy - vol_sell, 0).  Let's call this the net buy volume (NBV).  In a situation where RH is buying and selling in an unbiased way, this would be on the order of sqrt{vol_buy} since sell proceeds offset buy proceeds (not for a particular symbol, but *across the entire portfolio*).

It seems highly unlikely to me that most of the buy volume on Tues/Wed last week was from cash, and not also from sale of equities.  And, moreover, if it was from cash, then in order for the NBV to remain high, it would require a constant influx of cash into RH accounts.  Therefore I assume that the massive increase in deposit requirements actually came from the ""99%"" requirement and a massive increase in the estimated variance of the NBV on DTCC's part.

But the fucking situation is not symmetrical.  If RH did suddenly adopt a huge net long position (due to users primarily buying $GME), then the volatility to the *sell side* becomes huge, but not the volatility to the buy side.  But a huge move to the sell side is not risky to DTCC.  They want more deposits to protect the net buy side.  This isn't modeled by a normal distribution because the only way to keep having massive NBV is for users to keep depositing proportional equity (since selling other equities to buy $GME cancels out).

Of course, DTCC knows this, but it seemed like they had RH over a barrel, and if they could depress buying to limit their own exposure, that was a fortuitous consequence.

Finally, why didn't RH then adopt this position:  You could only buy $GME with equity from selling other shares.  This would make that user's contribution to the net buy volume zero.  It would also mitigate the problem of $GME causing an increase in the net buy volume.  And, moreover, it would have drastically lessened the manipulative effect on the markets, allowing people to mostly keep buying $GME."|2021-02-03 09:10:15.755295|../output/raw/2021/02/03/DueDiligence_flair_DD_091020.csv|DueDiligence|['DTCC']|[]|['I', 'WSB', 'I', 'RH', 'DTCC', 'RH', 'RH', 'NBV', 'RH', 'I', 'NBV', 'RH', 'DTCC', 'NBV', '$GME', 'DTCC', 'RH', 'RH', '$GME', '$GME', '$GME']|['RH', 'RH', 'RH', 'RH', 'RH', 'GME', 'RH', 'RH', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

I was looking at Hershey and comparing last year. They ran up from $145 at the end of January to $160 by Feb 14. 

Retail food sales have been huge all year with big YoY sales. It stands to reason that their sales for the Valentine’s Day holiday are going to crush last year. Their earnings report is Thursday. Most big box retailers placed their Valentine’s Day orders weeks if not months ago. So this should show up on their revenue.

[https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)

It looks like it only updates this data bi-monthly for the 1-15 16-30th  and the next report is due out at or around the 15th.  I am going to call the SEC tomorrow and ask for intermediate data.  We need this data NOW.  If you look at this.  GME has failed to deliver a LOT of shares all the time.   When I did some highschool excel Data Analytics on it.  It is the 60th stock on the list when sorted by # of shares.

From the SEC regarding this data

>""The  figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails.   In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific   point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's   aggregate fails.""

Looking at the above site.  There are links to information about Failed to deliver.[https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm)

Is GME considered a Threshold Security ✅

>In  order to be deemed a  threshold security, and thus subject to the  restrictions of Rule  203(b)(3), a security must exceed the specified  fail level for a period  of five consecutive settlement days.   Similarly, in order to be removed  from the list of threshold  securities, a security must not exceed the  specified level of fails for  a period of five consecutive settlement  days.

Does the Firm have to close out the positions? ✅

>As adopted, Rule 203(b)(3) requires any participant of a registered clearing agency (""participant"")[80](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P210_72014) to take action on all failures to deliver that exist in such securities ten days after the normal settlement date, *i.e.*, 13 consecutive settlement days.[81](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P211_72496)Specifically, the participant is required to close out the fail to   deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.  
>  
>Rule 203(b)(3) is intended to address potential abuses that may occur with large, extended fails to deliver.[89](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P221_79239)  We believe that the five-day requirement will facilitate the identification of securities with extended fails.

So  Dumb-ass me looked further back in time to the second half of  December.  It looks like GME has been failing to deliver CONSTANTLY.   This means that there are shares that Brokers HAVE to buy.  We are over the 10/13 Day limit.  What's going on here.  How can this single security CONSTANTLY fail to deliver almost every day... clearly something is going on here....  How are they CONSTANTLY failing?  Well,  that's because there are shares that are made up, it has to be.  This is shorted STILL beyond belief as of the 15th.

Our brokerages are allowed to lend out our shares as long as there are no open orders on them. So, put a daily sell limit order on all of your shares (at a reasonable 3x-4x the price that day) so that they can't be lent out. A website I also found helpful information from:

Stay strong, buy the dips, and hold, fellow retards!

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I just like the stock. I am a retard and please do your research.

&#x200B;

Edit: I am not advising anyone. I bought 15 shares at \~$290 last Wednesday, and tomorrow I'm putting my daily sell limit order at $5k lmao. And probably buying more tomorrow!

Edit 2: I’ve noticed my email shows some comments that look like they didn’t make it through due to new accounts/low karma, but I’ll try to answer the genuine questions through edits. Someone asked what platform I am using, and I use Vanguard. I’ve never had any issues with them, and they don’t limit how many $GME or $AMC shares I can buy.

Edit 3: Buying stocks with Vanguard is pretty straightforward. If you need help, feel free to PM me. Someone mentioned that the short ladders cause a placement of an artificial ceiling, meaning huge gains can’t be made. I’m not an expert by any means whatsoever, but if you look at the 2008 VW squeeze chart, that proves not to be true. Also, someone mentioned TD Ameritrade is limiting the sell limit. Go as high as it will let you, and if you don’t feel comfortable with that, it’s okay. If worse comes to worst, get a Vanguard account, buy shares through them, and set your sell limits to the stars.

Edit 4: Do not buy your shares on margin! A few of you have let me know that shares bought with cash accounts cannot be used for short attacks. Not sure if you all can see their comment, but /u/Germanicusss has advised to “pay down your margin debt and/or instruct your broker to move the shred into your cash account”. I need to do more research into that. Another reminder that this is not financial advise and I’m not an expert.

I am not a tax advisor, but I did some research and wanted to make you guys aware of these things before the next tax season comes around and your jaws drop because Uncle Sammy wants a cut of your tendies.

**LET'S START WITH CAPITAL LOSSES:**

I know a handful of you do not care if you end up holding the bag. But also consider this: you can use these losses to **REDUCE YOUR TAX BILL**. You can only do this if you do not have any capital gains or your capital losses is greater than your capital gains for the year (you have more losses than gains). Unfortunately you can **only deduct up to $3,000 per year** ($1,500 if married filing separately), so please don't risk more than you can afford. If you do happen to lose more than $3,000, I suggest only selling some shares at a time each year (probably around December) up to a loss of $3,000. The deduction used to be $4,000 so it can change year to year. **(Please see edit below for losses >$3,000).**

**CAPITAL GAINS (WHEN YOU COLLECT YOUR TENDIES):**

There are two different capital gains you can realize after you sell your shares: short term (<=1 year) and long term (>1 year).

Short term gains are taxed as ordinary income. What does that mean? It's essentially added together with your salary.

**Marginal Rates:** For tax year 2021, the top tax rate remains 37% for individual single taxpayers with incomes greater than $523,600 ($628,300 for married couples filing jointly). The other rates are:

* 35%, for incomes over $209,425 ($418,850 for married couples filing jointly);
* 32% for incomes over $164,925 ($329,850 for married couples filing jointly);
* 24% for incomes over $86,375 ($172,750 for married couples filing jointly);
* 22% for incomes over $40,525 ($81,050 for married couples filing jointly);
* 12% for incomes over $9,950 ($19,900 for married couples filing jointly).
* The lowest rate is 10% for incomes of single individuals with incomes of $9,950 or less ($19,900 for married couples filing jointly).

Long term gains follow a different set of rules as follows:

These are just general information. Please consult with a tax advisor as everyone's financial situations are different.

Also: there's a handful of you making donations which is freaking awesome. You should save those receipts as those donations can also be used to deduct your taxes. I currently cannot find info that would make sense (I guess I'm just as retarded as everyone else here). *(Edit: This only applies if you do an itemized deduction. Too lazy and complicated for me unless you have a smart tax advisor)*

If you got anything else I should add or inaccuracies in these info, I'll be sure to edit them. If this doesn't get approved as a post, then I just wasted the last few hours researching and typing this up.

Edit 1: Net **capital losses** in excess of $3,000 can be **carried forward** indefinitely until the amount is exhausted. Due to the wash-sale IRS rule, investors need to be careful not to repurchase any stock sold for a **loss** within 30 days, or the **capital loss** does not qualify for the beneficial tax treatment."|2021-02-03 09:10:15.755295|../output/raw/2021/02/03/DueDiligence_flair_DD_091019.csv|DueDiligence|['USA']|[]|['I', 'GME', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'BB', 'I', 'I', 'S', 'START', 'WITH', 'PITAL', 'I', 'EDUCE', 'YOUR', 'TAX', 'I', 'PITAL', 'GAINS', 'WHEN', 'YOU', 'LLECT', 'YOUR', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'IRS']|['GME', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'TAX']

1. Biden = healthcare and he’s looking to score big there. This will be a focal point. You know ThE fIrSt 1o0 dAyS

2. The language in Elizabeth Warren’s bill is super specific about protections on how patient data is stored, anonymized, and shared. Okay... 

3. Pharmacy’s partner up with fed for covid vaccination and the day before clover issued a statement around getting covid vaccines. 


4. Now all of that sounds great. However, why the sudden rush to introduce bills that are clearly addressing a concern around patient’s health data? It raises all sorts if questions for me like:

Who’s collecting this data that you’re so worried about its use and privacy?

Where are these concerns coming from? What is it that we are protecting ourselves from? Is that not weird y’all? Anyway, I guess the point there is that there is clearly some big push to collect and use our patient data by the government (pretty scary imo). Plus you know, google backed Clover. Which leads me to believe, based on the language around new technology in Biden’s initiative, that they are going to have to acquire this technology from somewhere. Where from though? 


Anyway, I’m excited to see how this narrative plays out in the coming weeks and months. Healthcare is a heavy political space, especially under Biden. Based on recent news, something is brewing. Too many coincidences lining up.

The shorts and WSB (with some whales and institutional supports) are fighting neck and neck, but why? 

The shorts want to bankrupt GME, we know that won’t happen because this company has Ryan Cohen as ceo. 

The shorts want to bring the price down as low as they can, but we keep buying the dips. If I’m honest, THE SHORTS ARE WINNING RIGHT NOW, but the short interest is still high, so they have to cover. 

#WE ARE SPENDING OUR CAPITAL BUYING THE DIPS, WHEN WE SHOULD HOLD OUR SHARES NOW, LET THE PRICE TANK, THEN BUY UP EVEN MORE SHARES 

Would you rather buy 3 shares for 80 a piece, just for the shorts to attack again tomorrow and the next day, day after day, or do you want to “let them” win, let the price tank, then buy up even more shares before they can cover? 

Spending 240 on 3 shares, or spending 240 on 24 shares at 10$ a piece WHILE eating up the available shares? I know which one sounds better to me. 






#THE SHORTS PLAN 


There’s a very plausible theory that the shorts want to bring the price down very cheaply, then they will buy far OTM calls, and trigger the squeeze themselves. Then once at the top they’ll buy puts and tank the price again. 


This allows them to 

#Cover 

#Make money on the upswing 

#Make money on the downswing 

#Possibly erase all of their losses and retain their investor base 



#TLDR: let the shorts drive the price down, DONT BUY THE DIP, just hold your shares you have now. And with your remaining capital watch the price tank, then snatch up 10x the amount of shares you would be able to during a normal dip.


#PLAY INTO THEIR HAND AND LET THEM THINK THEY’VE WON AND THAT WE GAVE UP.

Both are quite right. Vascepa is icosapent ethyl... a purified and modified omega-3 that when taken on top of a statin (think Lipitor) basically cuts your risk of dying, having a heart attack, or a stroke by 25%. 
Sounds good right? Lipitor was the best selling drug of all time until Humira. Yet it started out slow in its first year just like Vascepa...and without a pandemic. Now we have generic statins with hundreds of millions of patients worldwide taking daily. Lipitor had its run though. Just ask Pfizer. And it still sells tons of cabbage. But there is only one Vascepa that reduces your triglycerides and reduces your cardiovascular risk. Funny thing is...it’s not the triglyceride reduction that bestows the benefit......more later......Less stokes, stents, open heart bypass surgery....and DEATH!!! 

There are many different oils, or properly called fatty acids, in those over the counter omega-3’s you may take. But only this particular one has been shown in double blind randomized trials to Work. At least two of the others, DHA and DPA likely actually hurt!!!!! No one really knows why. We think it’s it’s powerful anti-inflammatory properties of 100% icosapent ethyl or EPA (Vascepa). 
Think.....“it coats the insides of your arteries and puts out the fire connected to the ticking time bomb”. For reference see the New England Journal of Medicine article from 2018 called the REDUCIT study. Also see the EVAPORATE study from 2020 that showed coronary artery plaque regression. That’s right...Vascepa likely is liquid draino for your coronaries!!!! 

Let that sink in a minute. There are two large Covid-19 studies reporting in first half of this year called MITIGATe and PREPARE—IT. Prepare-It will likely read out end of Feb. Mitigate interim around May. The thought is the anti inflammatory power of V helps. One Canadian study presented in December at the national lipid association showed statistics better than Remdesivir. Vascepa may snuff out the cytokines storm that kills you from Covid!!!! 
It may also disrupt the viruses transmissibility as covid is wrapped in...you guessed it...fatty acids and lipids. 
Let that sink in a minute. 

Amarin won the FDA approval for CVT reduction in Dec 2019. She hit $26 soon after. March 30, 2020 a Nevada judge was hoodwinked into overturning the patents of the original label for treating only patients with triglycerides over 500 to treat pancreatitis, thus potentially allowing generics to entreat themselves to AMARIN’s three billion a year US market (when mature..we only a year in). More than 90% of Vascepa scripts are for the cardiovascular indication...not for the skinny label treatment of triglycerides...for pancreatitis. The money is in the CVT risk reduction...i.e...the statin patients world wide. AMARIN spent nearly a billion dollars bringing this indication to market. And now generics want to try and steal it all. So far so good except for the market perception. AMARIN claims to have the API sources secured. 

Thus far there is one generic made by HICKMA. The company that won the court case. Litigation is still ongoing and AMARIN is now suing them for infringing on the CVT indication patents that are still quite valid. Damages could be huge!!!! 

Amarin won EU recommendation for the CVT indication in Europe on Friday and can start marketing likely by April. Europe’s market is maybe 50% larger than the US. Thus far Amarin has maintained the US market with Hickma currently holding 6% of the market. Yet the stock cratered from $26 to $4 in March. Today she sits just over $8. The drop was likely because all thought the US market was completely toast. Clearly it is not 4 months post generic launch. Add to this that Lovaza still makes up a large part of the prescription omega-3 market and there really is no good reason to ever take Lovaza now that Vascepa is here, and you can see that AMRN’s revenues are going to be huge. Last year was unaudited $611 mill. 1 billion tax loss carry over. 550 million in cash or investments. No debt. Zero debt...... Price currently $8.25 

There seems to be a lot of selling between entities to ladder step her down almost daily since the March debacle. Despite that she has doubled. That the company updated its “Change of control” package and policy in an 8-k filed this Friday, one day after European approval recommendation could mean a Buy Out is imminent. Amarin was built for a buy out. She a one drug pony, but the drug is a doozy. I truly believe US can generate $1 bill in sales. EU $3 billion a year. Approval in China by Amarin partner could generate $5 bill a year but AMARIN gets a straight high teens royalty from Eddingpharm ( the Chinese owned partner) 

Long story short, this drug saves lives and WILL make a lot of money. Last I looked there were 22 mill shares short. With float of 386 million but much more than half the float is locked up. The daily shenanigans need to stop. The respect and eyes of the world needs to be on Vascepa!!!! It’s truly a lifesaver with untold uses and benefits. I honestly believe there is a huge covid benefit to being on Vascepa and we will soon know. Let’s see what happens when the PEOPLE get behind a company that has been screwed over and over yet gets back up again because the science of the drug is a once in 50 years proven scientific discovery. I bet she deservedly goes gangbusters and MOST IMPORTANTLY ....then HOLDS her gains. There won’t be a find a chair when the music stops here.

u/PlatNoFeatures has done some great DD on the stock and that got me looking into it.

I am retarded. I did really good on the whole AMC and GME craze, got cocky, and fucked up everything on horrible calls with no research. Well I won’t do that again. Now I’ll fuck up money while doing lots of research so I have no excuse and feel even shittier.

I won’t go into the DD Plat already did, check this for that: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwo5p5/callaway/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwo5p5/callaway/)

Any way, as you can see from this fucking crayon drawing, now is a good time to buy ELY. The blue curvy line is not just a representation of my floppy dick, but also the 21 adaptive EMA moving average. Stonks love moving average and it’s about touching now so buy it might be gud idea. It might dip a little below I guess, the average is not a fucking time machine or a crystal ball.

Since December there has been support at around 22-23 dollars, and the resistance is obviously at 30 right now. High end price target is $40 with earnings coming up.

Now im new and obviously retarded so like...my crayon drawing probably doesnt mean shit but stonks supposedly love the average and we aren’t way above or below right now. I am highly considering selling everything i’m bag holding, which will come out to between 700-800 if I sold everything tomorrow no matter what lol and going in on calls.

That’s obviously not a big move for shares and I want to build the base up so calls it will most likely be. I have one 2/19 $31c right now at $1.39 premium. Probably go for 30’s if I “yolo” on this. I know it’s small money for now, fuck you im paying tuition.

One thing that is concerning is volume is low, but if wsb autists get on board, maybe we can do something.

Looking at RSI on the bottom and comparing to price vs average in the next pic, we see that it doesn’t appear to be overbought right now, further indication to try and get in around or slightly lower than today’s close

This is obviously not financial advice. Someone convince me to fuck off at 50% loss of initial investment on GME and AMC (including 2/19 calls for AMC) and go all in on this instead….you fuckers would love to see me blow up the account anyway.

EDIT: It's a fucking drive shack near me, not topgolf. Point stands, these types of venues pack the fuck out (even in pandemic)

This was NIO’s 6th consecutive month of sales growth, and they’ve now delivered 82,866 vehicles. They continue to outperform Xpeng and Li Auto, BUT are still trailing behind Papa Elon. So who gives a shit? *YOU should.* 💦😩

NIO is *only up 5%* over the past month, lagging and consolidating behind the broader market. Despite the fantastic delivery numbers AND the corresponding increase in EV market share, the share price DROPPED 2% today. Reminder that Pooh Bear J-Ping wants **25% of all new cars sold in the country to be electric by 2025**. NIO’s continual market share growth into *the* largest EV market in the world is literally an unmatched opportunity, with China’s EV sales [expected to top 1.8 MILLION THIS YEAR](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upcoming-catalyst-could-move-chinese-213553234.html). It has almost completely retraced it’s price back to it’s pre-NIO Day levels, suggesting that it’s ready for a breakout. No, literally [go look at it’s chart right now.](https://imgur.com/a/dtPsHVb)

&#x200B;

In addition to deliveries, NIO is rumored to be looking to **expand into Europe** with it’s SUVs. *THIS MAY BE THE LAST ENTRY POINT BEFORE THE RUN-UP AFTER EUROPE EXPANSION PLANS* They’ve also recently released their first sedan model and are expanding their Battery as a Service infrastructure throughout China. It also goes without saying that having active backup from your authoritarian country is VERY helpful.

So before the downvotes just rub those two brain cells of yours together for a minute to focus on this for the next three minutes. (Fuck you I know what I said)

Due to all of the paper handed bitches, hedge funds shorting, and just general fuckery at the hands of retail trading apps, particularly robinhood, NOK is currently on MASSIVE discount.  Why do I say that? Because the fine folks over at DNB markets, Norway’s leading investment bank, have raised its stock valuation to €4.80, or for those of us who speak freedom, $5.80.

Why does that matter? I hear you starting to ask. Well it matters because it’s currently trading at only $4.53. 

There is over a dollar of pure value just waiting to be claimed. Not to mention it is expecting a very strong earnings report that can cause that value to go up even more. O and the company had been vocal about wanting to start its dividend payments back up. This earnings report should put them on the map for a lot of people. I’m buying more tomorrow, see y’all in space.
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

TLDR: worst case I make $1 per share as it goes up back to its evaluated price, or I💎🤲 until it hits $10 a share as it’s 5G grows in the coming years. 

I’m not giving investment advice and no one should take this as such. Just did some research and wanted to share.

Collusion between RH, prime brokers and the DTC can potentially damper the effects of the short squeeze because of loose and unsanctioned SEC rules regarding Regulation SHO that governs short selling, and in this case, [failures-to-deliver](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm).

If you have a margin account, brokerages do not need your permission to lend your exercisable shares if you buy a call or sell a put. This is their way of temporarily creating shares out of thin air, aka counterfit shares. While you wait for expiration date, brokerages keep a tab of all its customers' ""lendable shares"" and sends it to the DTC in this thing called the share borrowing program. The DTC will then lend those to other brokerages whos customers just bought a call option that is essentially a naked call initiated by the seller. Now while this call option remains open, since it's a naked short, the shares get to be lent again into another new naked short in a other brokerage, in **an ever-perpetuating cycle that results in a temporary increase of the number of total shares traded**.

This trick hedge fund use is called Continuous Net Settlement (CNS), and there are many other ways for shortsellers can manipulate the stock price, inclusing Ex-clearing and Fails-to-deliver strategies.

So if you buy a call or sell a put from a margin account, you're essentially allowing the number of total shares to grow artificially which makes the price go down!!!

Plus, these created shares cannot be accounted for, but in most cases, undiscoled short shares typically represent 20 to 50 times the number of failures-to-deliver (which is the only metric the SEC tracks).... that's HUGE!

Now to the main subject GME is still an undervalued treasure. I know it seems like it might be overvalued because of the euphoria around GME these past two weeks, and how the media (and even some folks on wsb) try to portray it as a bubble, which it isn't.

1. Its a company with around $6 billions in annual revenues, and a new set of innovative leaders (Cohen and friends) who have a track record of turning companies into money printers (Chewy Inc now worth over $44 billion, was first losing money and bringing less than $26 million in revenue).
2. Its growing its E-commerce side by a whooping 254% (25% of all revenue was form online sales last quarter).

The hype is dying as all hypes do, the whole thing is glued with spit and running on pure randomness and doom inevitability (""we're all poor so we don't care, it's either moon or bankruptcy"").

TH THA THA TH, time out.

Listen up fucktards, I'm poor too, but that's not the point. We need to go over the whole situation with perspective, and this is not some detailed nerd shit so it'll go easy on your 2 braincells.  


Repeat after me: we are not gonna trigger the short squeeze. WE ARE NOT GONNA TRIGGER THE SHORTSQUEEZE.  
It's easy to fall into disbelief by misunderstanding our part in all of this. We are not triggering shit, so all the retards YELLING buy buy buy every time it starts to go up need to come back to reality. It's NOT our job to trigger the short squeeze nor would we be able to.  


Picture a roman colosseum (an old stadium you mongs). In the middle of the arena, down in the pit you have all the shorters doing their thing, having a jolly good time. There's several tunnels surrounding the pit and leading OUT to freedom. 

To get the short squeeze we need them right there in the pit, so that's done. They're already there, shorting GME to shit, not by 13% which was enough to rocket VW share price 5X back in 2008, but by a staggering 50% to 130% (numbers irrelevant, point is the ammo is more than enough). As you can see there's plenty of shorters in the pit, so they're confident and comfortable.

  
Now, for the shortsqueeze to work you need 2 things:

\- a boogeyman  
\- something blocking the goddamn exit  


The boogeyman is ANYTHING that makes them fear for their billions and run for the exit trampling each other on the way out. The less shares available for them to cover their shorts the smaller this boogeyman can be, because they will panic knowing they may not be able to cover at all, meaning THE END.   
It could be literally a thousand different things, and the longer we go into the future the more likely that something will HIT. Could be someone scooping up an extra slice of the company (Ryan Cohen for example), earnings blowing out, anything. And this company has received SO MUCH free advertising in the last few weeks it's not unreasonable to think that they are at a historic turning point (not gonna get into the reasons why it's already a great value investment), and it will soon show.  


THEN, we come.  
We, the group of INDIVIDUALS that happen to be investing in the same stock because we like it.

What are we? We are bodies.  
Pilling up.  
On the fucking exits.

The more shares you own the fatter you are, and the fatter you are the more space you take up on the exit. And my friend my friend, the hedgies are REALLY gonna need the exit when the boogeyman shows up.  


Our role here is to buy as many shares as we can in order to clog the exit doors, so that the shorters have no way out when a boogeyman comes.If something big drops and there's not enough unflinching share ownership (buyers that won't sell no matter what), then the shorts will just make their way out and fuck all will happen.

Sure, there must be a lot of individuals and institutions unwilling to sell to bail shorts if they need to cover, say most of the GME board for example and maybe a couple institutions, but likely not nearly enough.

That's our part. If say half the people on WSB buy an average of 5 shares, that would be nearly 20 million shares. That's nearly 1/3 of the total GME shares available.If say, over a month we are able to turn that average into 10 per person, half of WSB would own a staggering 60% of all the shares, and you may say oh well that's not possible BUT JUST THINK ABOUT IT, many among us have investments in the hundreds of thousands, some even millions. Each one of those can bring the average up a hell of a lot.Heck, even I with my 20 shares god bless them, can make up for 3 people on WSB that bought nothing.  


Time really is on our side, if we just keep gobbling up shares we can really block those exits for the shorts, and when the time comes they will panic because they will realise there simply aren't enough shares to cover - GME goes straight to the MOON.

We don't need to worry at all, there is no losing here because mathematically it's a time bomb.THIS WILL NOT SURVIVE ON HYPE.HYPE IS NOT OUR FRIEND.Understanding the situation and calmly and patiently executing is how we can succeed.  


We need to unify, clarify, focus and execute.  


&#x200B;

**TLDR -**

**The GME gang is losing its way because its all hype now. Hype will kill this because hype dies.We need to clarify our role and execute with patience. We don't trigger short squeezes, our function is to accumulate as many shares as possible so that when the time comes and something big and positive drops, the shorters try to cover but can't because we have all the stock (or most of it), they panic and GME moons.Basically the only thing that matters is to keep accumulating as many shares as you can, and to understand your role. This diamond hand shit is NOT needed because the price is irrelevant, it's the inevitable math of the short squeeze that matters and that's where the focus needs to be.**

Over the past week you've been bombarded with numerous challenges, from brokers restricting purchases, fake news, to stock dilution. It is always harder to hold a winning position than a losing one so my hats off to you sir if you are still holding.

With that being said, I'd like to talk to you about a next potential candidate for our short squeeze strategy. The company is Tilray ($TLRY). You've probably seen this symbol floating around in different posts but I'd like to talk to you specifically about the numbers and the timing of it.

If you've been living under a rock or on a tree (You ape) Tilray is a Canadian Cannabis company with its stock traded on the Nasdaq (Not a lot of legal Cannabis companies are traded on the regulated exchanges so this is a big thing). Aphria ($APHA) is in the process of acquiring Tilray and post-acquisition will become the largest Cannabis company in the world. The deal is expected to close sometime during the second quarter and $APHA will be taking over the Tilray name and the $TLRY symbol on the Nasdaq.

As per Yahoo Finance, the latest float is about 95 Million shares and even though the current shares sold short (From Jan 15, 2021) is 34.37 Million which is moderate, one should pay attention to the historical total shares sold short which from a month ago has grown more than 24%. This means there is something in play and I am also willing to bet based on current price action and historical trends, the next short interest release will go up as well.

&#x200B;

[Large Rise in Total Shares Sold Short](https://preview.redd.it/pemqywhf07f61.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=813869b0195bc158c342de184f9a9dae2d3d598f)

Based on the amount of money involved there is probably one large or multiple large hedge funds playing this since they are the only ones sophisticated enough to sell shares short especially involving that much money. You can also look at the price action itself prior to Monday (When Good news got released) during different times of the day, there are always trades put in near the closing to make sure the prices don't exceed a certain price level which indicates true active manipulation by the bears. Retail traders are not sophisticated enough to do this thus indicating large hedge fund involvement.

There are a couple of factors that will help us with this conquest.

1. The Timing and News: Obviously, with this democratically controlled congress, legalization is a priority and has the highest chances of succeeding in this current political environment. As you have seen before (Do your own DD), any indication or news of progress of legalization has pushed this stock up. As of Monday, three senators; Chuck Schumer (NY), Cory Brooker (NJ), and Ron Wyden (OR) just promised to introduce marijuana legalization reform in the ""early part"" of the year. So there is a string of news and progress coming.
2. Way better fundamentals than $GME and $AMC: The poor fundamentals obviously bothered a lot of people who wanted to buy $GME and $AMC. But in comparison, if you dig into Tilray's financials, it is significantly better. Especially the cash balance. Mostly importantly, Tilray's product lines are diversified and they are currently still growing (this is a big thing for any business), especially in the international markets.
3. Its already primed: If you dig around Reddit, WSB, or even Stocktwits, you can see numerous people have already committed to baggage holding this stock. You are not too early and you won't be the only one to do so.
4. Harder for Management to Dilute the shares: As we saw previously, one of the challenges for the buyers of $GME and $AMC was battling against management's decision of stock dilution by the companies themselves. To put it in retard terms, diluting a stock is essentially printing more shares thus creating inflation in the stock so its harder to go up. Since Tilray is in the process of the acquisition by Aphria and it is an ALL STOCK deal via conversion ratio, it makes it harder for Tilray to implement dilution without significantly risking the deal.
5. Lightning can strike twice: A short-squeeze already happened in the past (2018) so you know the short-squeeze strategy already worked for this stock so it can work again. The brokers and exchanges are more prepared as their volatility risk models are already prepared to support significant high levels of volatility for this stock. Less chance for disruptions.
6. A means to an end: Lets be realistic, if you are holding $GME and $AMC right now, you will sell it. It could be tomorrow or it could be 3 years from now (If those companies are still in business) but you WILL sell it.  THAT is a very long time to hold baggage just to prove a point and you know the businesses you are holding suck from a business standpoint. Now since the Tilray and Aphia acquisition deal is on a timetable which will be completed sometime in the second quarter, that can be your exit time. You can go out gracefully if you choose to as you've already proven your point, made some money, and on the dawn of Tilray becoming a different company and under new management. For those of you choosing to keep those those shares post acquisition, how would you feel about holding shares to the largest Cannabis company in the world with good fundamentals, and on the dawn of full federal marijuana legalization? I would love it.
7. Great Symbolism: Lets face it, investing in a failing gaming company and movie theaters during a global pandemic doesn't really scream smart symbolic reform or via la revolution that well. But if you choose to focus on making a stand with a legal Cannabis company with a great future you can at the same time promote marijuana legalization and stick it to the hedge funds and dark capitalism at the same time. What better way to make a point to promote a great cause, symbiotic change, and at the same time make some money (If we are all on board).

Ok that's it! Kudos to you for making it to the end. Apologies for the long post but I really wanted to  get my points through. You all should obviously do your own due diligence and if you see what I see and the immense opportunity that is in front of us, and agree with my thoughts then lets do this!

BTW, if you are really retarded; I am NOT telling you to sell your $GME and $AMC. I'm only suggesting that we should start to look at other potential candidates for our short squeeze strategy to continue our cause of burning hedge funds and dark capitalism.

I just feel Tilray is such a great candidate for our cause and strategy especially with so much marijuana reform coming our way. We can make a greater point for a greater cause.

Thank you and trade well,

Here’s a little of my own DD.

There is So much to talk about. But, the First Data deal made Fiserv a powerhouse in payment processing and digital payments when they took over Clover. This market has three main pillars:
Point of sales (POS) terminals
Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments
E-commerce solutions
  Being a leader in any one of these categories should make Fiserv a $100 billion company. Its current value is $70 billion. But Fiserv is now the largest POS provider and P2P payment processor... And the company is going to use its expansive network to quickly build out its new omnichannel e-commerce solution.
A leader in all three of these categories has the potential to be well over a $300 billion company. FISV is partnered with Zelle, does more payments than PYPL’s Venmo and SQ  CashApp. PYPL has a market cap of 278 billion as of last Friday. If FISV can get to $100 billion it should put its PT at $150 and that’s very low ball. Their margins are going to continue to grow and if they just matched PYPL market cap, it would put them over $300 a share. There are several potential catalysts as far as buy backs, earnings, etc. 

As I mentioned above, Clover is bigger than Square, yet is only part of FISV business, and the two go after different markets. Clover (generally) works with bigger businesses. Over 90% of Clover customers process over $125,000 in payments annually. Only 65% of Square’s customers transact that much. Not trying to bash SQ, only showing that FISV has a lot of catching up to do as it is still trailing SQ market cap by 30 Billion. 

The difference between Zelle and PYPL’s Venmo and SQ (cash app) is that Zelle is backed by multiple large institutions like Chase, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, and Capital One. The traditional financial institutions basically joined together to build a network so they wouldn’t be outdone by the likes of Venmo or Cash App. The advantage is that all of the financial institutions involved
in Zelle are marketing the P2P service to their customers and it’s only going to grow. Fintech will be one of the hottest sectors going forward and FISV will be the leader. No reason why FISV isn’t at least $150-200 by EOY. Earnings 2/9.

Last few days there has been this talk about shorts already covered, and S3 Partner's data showed a large decline in short interest. However, is this the full picture? We will be looking at this using Math. 

Context :[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)

 """"it reduces the traditional SI % Float, Instead of Shares Shorted/Float our calc is Shares Shorted/ (Float + Shares Shorted) """"

Basically, the S3 short interest is calculated as

f(x) = x/(k+x)

where f(x) is S3's short interest, x is shares shorted, and k is float, which we can assume is a constant

For the Math savvy autists, you probably already see the problem. If you are not, open Desmos and graph the above function.

For k been positive and real, This function **asymptotically approaches 1** i.e. 100%. It should be pretty obvious - shares shorted + something positive is larger than shares shorted, so the fraction is smaller than 1. And, surprise surprise, data before 1/29 have short interest higher than 1!

**That means that either S3 partners is completely bullshiting their data, or the more likely case -  short interest displayed before 1/29 is traditional interest.**

Looking at this tweet [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897), we can see that the traditional SI on 2/1 is **78.16MM** shares on **51.03MM** float, which equates to....drum roll please...

***153%*** ***Short interest!***

So not only have the shorts not squeezed, they have doubled down. And this explains the price action much better - the price dipped down on a **Increased selling**.

Found this in a comment buried in a comment on a post ([Sober view post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbaktb/sober_review_time_what_are_the_actual_data_we_can/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)) and thought I would shine some light on it. The sober view post has some very good DD presenting both potential upside and downsides in what I believe is a fair manner. Be cautious, there are a lot of downsides. I recommend you read it before you simply get hyped. That being said... Hype Train inbound 🚂🚂🚂

 [S3 partners intentionally changed how they calculate SI % interest to manipulate public perception of shorts closing their positions.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/) 

Pretty much the reason why S3 partners is estimating 55% short interest is because they changed the formula. It would be equivalent to what we would call 122% SI before the change (other people's math, not my own).

&#x200B;

They changed the formula from 

`SI = (shorts/float)`
to
`SI = (shorts/(float+shorts))`

This formula guarantees SI to always be beneath 100. 

Pretty much, 

0% is still 0%

50% is the new 100%

It doesn't scale up exactly linearly.

Do your DD, this is not financial advice, just thought I would bring this to light.

Be careful, do your research, not only is the game changing in front of us, but so are the standard measures.

Cleaned up some formatting for mobile, added link to sobering post

Note:

I am not claiming the short squeeze is still happening or that it is likely happening. I would guess it's very likely they bought high strike puts which would make the amount we would have to go up SIGNIFICANTLY higher.

#  Wait, WTF is a SHORT EXEMPT?

**- A short that doesn't have to follow the uptick rule, can be sold whenevs.**

# WHO THE FUCK SETS WHICH ARE SHORT EXEMPT?

# THE BROKERS, and it's not even checked unless an audit occurs

""...broker-dealers  are required to document their polices for how they mark orders as  exempt, and, if audited, provide evidence that they have followed their  documented policies and procedures. Broker-dealers therefore mark an order short exempt if they believe it  qualifies for an exception. The primary exception is the use of  non-standard pricing quotes for trade execution. **That means that if  prices come in outside the** [**National Best Bid or Offer (NBBO)**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp)**,  they can initiate a short-sale order that they judge would have  qualified as an uptick in more orderly markets.** Marking for these orders  is signified by SSE. All orders marked SSE will be closely checked by  self-regulatory organizations and the SEC for compliance with Regulation  SHO exceptions. "" **-Investopedia**

TLDR; Broker-Dealers are marking a HUGE AMOUNT of shorts as exempt from the uptick rule because all of our smoothbrained sell limits of $69420,69 are outside the National Best Bid, according to them, but it's ok because they are self-regulating.... **FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUU.....**

Tanger literally has open air malls that make it really unique in this new era of bricks and mortar retail.

Now, let’s look at the technicals. It currently has a 52% short float, which lags large squeezes like GME (121%) and SPCE (72%), but exceeds that of other performing names like AMC and BB.

I think $SKT is so compelling at a roughly $1.2B market cap. For comparison, its primary competitor $MAC has double the valuation, but does not have the same flexible retail space as Tanger.

If you look at GME’s short squeeze, they shot up right around $20 or ($1.2B market cap)!! 👀 Furthermore, Melvin and other big hedge funds are long on their $SKT shorts, and any surprise to the upside will send the stock absolutely flying.

Tanger has also reinstated their dividend. In a time where many bricks and mortar retail shops are desparate for cash, $SKT is out here with $700M of liquidity.

Companies with this much cash relative to their market cap are INTRINSICALLY UNDERVALUED. Even if this thing were to just double in market cap to just under $3B, that would leave a share price of roughly $32. The intrinsic value of the mall network is worth AT LEAST (in my mind) 5-7X where we are now at roughly $13 ($1.2B). 

These other names that I mentioned above have taken off given their market cap of $3-5B, and I FULLY EXPECT THAT RALLY TO CONTINUE. The short interest here is just too overwhelming for it to not push the stock flying at the slightest uptick.

But for the best value play, FACTORED WITH THE HEAVY SHORT FLOAT, I gotta go with $SKT. Holding 3200 shares at $17 and adding more as we go down. 18.7 days left for shorters to cover, so I think the squeeze is coming soon.

** Check out Tanger’s new CEO, Steven Yalof, if you are interested. He was a prominent leader at Simon Property Group, with the intent on expanding consumer base beyond retail stores. Let’s hope he get’s it right with $SKT. 🙏🏾

I know GME is still the hottest thing around. But, I am here to present a smart play, short and long term.

Desktop Metal (DM) DD

DM is a pure play manufacturing company that develops metal 3d printers. They are looking to replace metal casting and metal injection molding in the next 5 - 10 years. I believe that it could become a major player in the advanced manufacturing revolution and have 10x valuation.

The share price right now is around $25. I am expecting it to go to at least $30 in the very near future and this can easily go to $100 in 2-3 years.

Pros :

1. Stellar team: The team consist of professors from MIT, engineers from google,  Stratasys and the likes.

2. Clients: All major automotive OEMs such as General Motors, Ford, Nissan as well as Electronics manufacturers such as SBD are their client.

3. They just launched a new manufacturing system today. The new printer eliminated the solvent debind process which will decrease the cost and time of manufacturing.

4. Earnings are coming up on 11th Feb.

5. The average price target is around $26. The high is $30. The buy rating is around 70% with 0% sell rating.

6. It has a 25% short interest. There are around 15000 $25 calls expiring on 19th Feb. The short sellers are trying to keep the price of the stock below $25. Notice that today the price jumped on the news of the new printer but fell immediately afterwards.

7. Chamath did a PIPE investment in this.

8. It's 10th on the PRNT etf by Cathie Woods.

9. They just bought a dental 3d printing company which is a leader in their field. They have enough cash reserve to buy competitors and increase their revenue streams.

Cons :

1. The company is still pre revenue. Earliest revenue would be by 2022 probably.

2. Huge competition from players such as 3ds, Stratasys, Formlabs etc

(More cons are welcome)

My positions:

100 shares at $21.35

7 calls for $40 05/21,
9 calls for $35 05/21,
1 call for $20 05/21

Due to all the positive sentiment around, this should easily run upto atleast $30 before the earnings. It has already touched $28 last week. Also, for the Technical analysis geeks, this has formed a nice cup and handle shape and should be ready to rocket!

Buying May or further call should make 75-100% profit in the short term. Should hold shares for the long term.

PS: This is not an investment advice. I am a Mechanical Engineer and I love 3d printing and hence I have invested in this stock. Please do your personal DD.

>There is no time to enjoy the sunshine like every time. Solei’s hard seltzers are created with the perfect combination of freshness and crisp flavours. Made with sun-kissed fruits, Solei Hard Seltzer brings the sun all year round. (Pg.27)

I wouldn’t be surprised to see the Solei concept featured on SweetWaters newly released [Premium Hard Seltzer](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210125005211/en/SweetWater-Releases-Oasis%C2%AE-Premium-Hard-Seltzer) at some point.

In addition to its traditional distribution footprint, SweetWater 420 Extra Pale Ale and IPA are served on all Delta flights nationwide plus internationally totaling more than 50 countries across six continents which has served to extend SweetWater's brand reach on both a national and international level. The Company also hosts an annual music festival, ""SweetWater 420 Fest,"" that has evolved into one of the largest and most anticipated music festivals in the U.S., increasing brand awareness nationwide.

This move creates a branded cannabis lifestyle Products Company with a diverse revenue base. I strongly encourage everyone to look into the management on both sides and come to your own conclusions. I also made a post about about the Aphria/Tilray merger, feel free to check it out:

I guess, the question to ask is what is required to trigger second round.

1) buy volume increase / reduced short sale ratio ? ( fellow retards currently waiting for account transfers)

2) Failure to delivery deadlines approaching ?

3) More good news from management/board, RC etc.

Short Stocks and Dividend Payments 

Shorting a stock is essentially selling it and then buying it back at a future price.

1 -﻿ If the price falls, there is a profit. If the price rises to $512.00 there is a LOSS. The stock needs to be BORROWED from a shareholder to sell it without owning it. A brokerage firm usually handles this process. There is generally a borrowing fee for the stock, depending on its availability and liquidity. Additionally, the borrower of the stock is responsible for paying any DIVIDENDS.

&#x200B;

2﻿ - If an investor is short a stock on the record date, they are NOT entitled to the dividend.

&#x200B;

3 -﻿ In fact, the investor is instead responsible for PAYING the dividend owed to the lender of the shorted stock that they borrowed.

Special Considerations:

Shorting stocks are considered RISKY and appropriate only for sophisticated traders (MELVIN IS A DUMBASS) due to the general upward trend of stocks, borrowing costs, and the skewed risk-reward nature of shorting. Over time, stocks appreciate as inflation erodes the value of currencies. Companies, through their business operations, protect against inflation as they can pass on rising costs to customers. This is one reason for the general upward trajectory of stock indexes over time.

&#x200B;

Borrowing costs can be significant depending on the stock, typically between 2% and 10% annually. **30% in exceptional cases**.

&#x200B;

4﻿ -﻿ Of course, there is the additional cost of paying out DIVIDENDS. This is a significant drag on returns and compounds the difficulty of the task. Finally, **BASIC MATH** works against short selling as well. A stock can go up by multiples if there is a takeout offer or the company comes out with some INNOVATIVE product.

Corsair Gaming ($CRSR)

*Redefining gaming, eSports, and streaming*

Company Overview

Corsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California.

They acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market, Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom-built PC systems and console controllers markets, respectively, and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam, and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market.

Corsair went public on September 23, 2020, with its IPO priced at $17, valuing the company at about $1.3B.

Understanding the Business

**Value Proposition**

Corsair provides specialized, high-performance gear for gamers and streamers. Their products are designed to provide speed and reliability for competitive gaming, high quality content for streamers, and powerful PC components that allows gamers to run modern games smoothly.

**Revenue Streams**

Currently, Corsair groups its product offering into two segments: gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems.

Gamer and Creator Peripherals:

which represents around 25% of net revenue, includes gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets, streaming gear, and high performance console controllers.

Gaming Components Systems:

which represents around 75% of net revenue includes computer cases, power supply units (PSU), high performance memory products (40% of net revenue), and custom-built gaming systems.

Acquisitions and Partnerships:

During 3Q 2020 Corsair acquired Gamer Sensei, a gaming coaching platform, EpocCam, an app that allows iPhones to serve as a webcam, and partnered with Pipeline, a course-based education platform for streamers.

Industry

**Market Size**

According to Jon Peddie Research, the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach $40B by the end of 2020. Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.

Additionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.

**Industry Fundamentals**

Growth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.

Popularity of gaming is increasing:

According to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.

Tech-driven improvements in game quality:

Advances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.

Increasing gaming and streaming engagement:

Some interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks’ State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:

* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games
* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves
* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive
* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.

**The eSports and streaming flywheel**

The rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.

Competitive Landscape & Risks

**Competition**

The gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair’s product offering includes:

**Gaming keyboards and mice** \- Logitech and Razer

**Headsets and related audio products** \-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX

**Streaming gear** \- Logitech and AVerMedia

**Performance controllers** \- Microsoft and Logitech

**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake

**High performance memory** \- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron

**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower

**Competitive Strategy**

The company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.

**Market Share**

According to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.

**Growth Strategy**

Move into the Asia Pacific region:

The Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.

Complimentary acquisitions:

Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.

New Markets:

Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.

**Threat of New Entrants**

Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).

**Threat of Substitution**

A significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair’s business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.

Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user’s system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.

According to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.

Additionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.

**Moats**

There does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair’s market share across their product offering.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

NASA selected Nokia exclusively to build the first cellular network on the moon. 

[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface)

First, in regards to Nokia’s business. Nokia, unfortunately, doesn’t manufacturer phones anymore. Nokia sold the right to produce Nokia branded phones to HMD Global while retaining the right to have some input. Nokia’s current business concentrates on mobile networks such as 5G, network infrastructures, and cloud services. In other words, Nokia business pertains to the most basic component of our modern civilization. Especially so the Post-COVID world where networking is even more important than before. Think of the Tesla cars. They are connected to AT&T cellular networks which are built by Nokia. Nokia will be leading the networks that would eventually enable automation. And when that happens, Nokia will have a continuous revenue stream. 

[https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g](https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g)

Nokia is leading mobile networks with 27% of the world (excluding China) market share of 4G and 5G. It currently holds more than 3000k patents for 5G. Nokia other major competitors are Ericson, Huawei, and ZTE. Some countries of the Western hemisphere and the G7 banned Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE from operating in their countries. I suspect this will continue in the future. Leaving us with only Nokia and Ericson. But couldn’t a Mega-Cap such as Google or Tesla somehow eliminate NOK and ERIC? NOK holds more than 3000 patents already. So there is a strong barrier of entry into such a business. That won’t happen unless Nokia licences a patent for such a company. In this hypothetical scenario, the Mega-Cap would have to acquire Nokia. Which in turn will raise the price of the stock. I think this is the case that is similar to MSFT under Ballmer’s where the stock price was stagnant for many years. But slowly surged under Nadella. Though given the catalyst of COVID-19, I think the surge will happen quicker with NOK.

At 4.53 a share. NOK P/E ratio is 30.81x. Which is a small discount in comparison with the S&P 500 which has P/E ration of about 39x. This establishes Nokia not only as a growth stock but also as a value stock. The lowest that NOK dropped to was 2.34. Which happened back in March. At the current price, I believe that NOK is well within the margin of safety. 

With that being said, there are some problems that should be addressed. The income trend in the past few years is problematic. But this can offset by the fact that NOK has contracts well into the future with many nations states and private companies that should generate ample income until NOK is able to eliminate Huawei and ZTE and in turn, dominate the market (With Ericson). Also, Nokia is spening billions on research 

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-proximus/nokia-wins-5g-contract-from-proximus-luxembourg-idUSKBN28P0WJ 

The second complication is that Biden or other G7 leaders could potentially reverse Trump’s ousting of Huawei and ZTE. I don’t think this is likely. But it’s certainly a possibility. But even if it happens. Nokia will still have a big market share. And 100% market share of the moon and will always have a priority over Huawei and ZTE for government projects for reasons of national security. Also, there is a substantial amount of money spent on R&D which will I believe will be a catalyst in the future surge in NOK.

It should be worth noting that just one day after RH banned NOK, Blackrock released an amendment to their ownership of NOK. Increasing their shares by  21,140,777 shares.

Even though at this point Blackrock owns 5% of practically everything. The increase is a good question. 

Now you might ask me why not Ericson? ERIC is also a good stock. But I see more value in NOK. Also, the fact the NOK is working on 1 Terabit per second internet, and that it will bring 4G to the moon, and the fact that Nokia is #1 by patterns give it an edge in innovative growth. 

Final words: GME to the moon and pigs get slaughtered."|2021-02-03 09:10:15.755295|../output/raw/2021/02/03/DueDiligence_flair_DD_091019.csv|DueDiligence|['NOK']|['NOK']|['NOK', 'G', 'NASA', 'HMD', 'G', 'COVID', 'T', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'ZTE', 'ZTE', 'I', 'NOK', 'ERIC', 'NOK', 'I', 'MSFT', 'I', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'E', 'P', 'E', 'NOK', 'I', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'ZTE', 'WJ', 'ZTE', 'I', 'ZTE', 'D', 'I', 'NOK', 'RH', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'SC', 'A', 'SC', 'A', 'ERIC', 'I', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'G', 'GME']|['NOK', 'NOK', 'ERIC', 'NOK', 'MSFT', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'RH', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'ERIC', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'GME']

I love ford, my first car I personally bought was a Ford Fusion. Microsoft wanted to partner with Ford ($F) but had to go with General Motors ($GM) because Ford already was talking to Google ($GOOG).

Position Disclosure: 20 $F 11$ calls for 2/5, 6 $IDEX 5$ calls 3/19

There's a fireside chat this Thursday where they lay out their EV strategy but here's why I'm in safe calls

1. Ford outsells NIO and TSLA byyy farrrr!
2. Partnership with Rivian isn't forgotten and a team committed for a futuristic EV design (more people like how the All-Electric Ford F150 looked compared to the Tesla Cybertruck (and won it in a tug-of-war battle recently) 
3. GM is trading at more than 4x the price of F (buying Nikola and faking a EV Hummer video)
4. Back in 2014, the Ford navigation was using $MSFT Cortana's voice for their entertainment / engagement. I'm sure $MSFT wanted to partner with Ford but had to settle something like $GM because it was already talking with $GOOG (which has most chance of creating driverless cars).
5.  Ford unlocked it's CANbus that year and let developers go to town with their apps. For a moment their cars were used by $UBER and some private researchers in their driverless fleet

It's not gonna move to $50 but it definitely has potential to reach $20 imo.

Dear diary,

Last week we had seen some shit in the market. Brokers shut down the American free market for some time. The whole world talked about us at first, but then the attacks began.

We were marked as market manipulators. However, we had support. By millionaires, billionaires and politicians. Soon we weren’t market manipulators anymore, but people who saved businesses.

However, the HF were smart. They had a crisis meeting and changed the narrative. They took positions in SLV and then called their friend at the news outlets. They changed the narrative from a GME squeeze to a silver squeeze. The whole day everybody on mainstream media talked about fucking SLV. But we kept strong, we fought the fake news with facts until they stopped talking about it. During this attack we lost some men who switched to SLV.

However, then Friday came. The HF started their short ladder attacks. At first we did not recognize these attacks. We didn’t know how to defend ourselves, then to stay together, buy the dips and shut our eyes from the reds. A lot of options were in the call and it costed them millions.

The HF called all their quants this weekend. They picked some PhD students from Harvard, Stanford and Oxford and made their plans. They did the math, analysed WSB and then knew what to do: *WSB grew from 2.2 million to 8.4 million in a week. Most of these people are not retarded enough to hold the stocks if they lose 5%. So lets continue the short ladder attacks and let them fear the big money.*

And that’s what happened on Monday. They regrouped and started the attack… We lost a lot of apes on Monday. Then the second attack on Tuesday. I must say, I almost cried. A lot of people left the fight. They told their wife’s boyfriends that he will become a millionaire, but lost a couple of hundreds, so they left the fight. At the end of the day there were only a couple of diamond handed people left. Moral is low. On twitter we called for our Daddy Ryan Cohen, however, no response…

But then the post of u/DFV. After topping an unrealized return of 48 million, he lost approximately half during this weeks fight. He came with his post and showed us that he will continue the fight with or without us. The most loyal to DFV and GME are staying now. Me too. DFV showed me how to become rich, he gave me a taste, something I never had. Now, I will stay until the end.

This reminds me of the fight of the 300 Spartans against the Persians. During the first fights everybody stayed and fought successfully. But then when King Leonidas wanted to continue for freedom and respect, a majority of his soldiers left. Only the most loyal and strong stayed. This is us now in this moment. The loyal and strong Spartans are the Diamond Hands. Our king is DFV and our fight is against the strong HF. We might die, but that does not matter. Because in the end we showed them our strength and saved GME.

BTW Mods, maybe make a motivation flair?

The captain got hurt during the fight. He retreated with his paperhands fighters. It took a while, but he told the story of the dapper and mightly King Leonidas and his diamond hand soldiers. He came back with the greatest and largest army yet and defeated the Persians. 

Yes wait, our captain is Ryan. He will come to help us. He wouldnt just meme some on twitter and leave us alone.

There were many 🦍 who delivered the morning 🧻 route directly onto the lawns of those who scripted the headlines the night before. The question is though, *how many* 🦍? How many 🦍delivered 🧻to the Hedge Fund's while they strolled out onto the front lawn of their mansions in their Ugg boots, sipping their freshly brewed covfefe.

*How much of the trading volume was* 🧻🦍*and how much was* 🌈🤖?

I'm just your average 🦍. My thumb is barely opposable. Luckily, yahoo finance allows you to navigate its site by simply licking the keys. After a couple short circuits resulting from my overly fluid salivary glands, I stumbled upon the following trading data. This isn't no technical shit, I can only count to 10. Luckily for me that is all that I need.

Below you will see the Open, High, Low and Close for the past few weeks. Now, I'm no wrinkle brain but I see a lot of 0's for us dumb 🦍who randomly mash 'buy at market'.

Retarded 🦍aside, coincidentally, there are lots of red rectangles over the previous week of trading. This to me, highlights when our good pal 🌈🤖came to visit.

From Jan 26th till 28th, the crayon is only scribbled over the daily 'High'. Is this from 🌈🤖scrambling to buy back shares in an illiquid, 💎🦍sell depth? Maybe. Maybe 🧻🦍just had limit sells because they like taking 🍌while 💎🦍not looking.

The more interesting part is that 7 out of 9 price points over the last three days have 🌈🤖fingerprints on them. To put this in perspective, the next 🌈🤖00's not in this picture isn't until Jan 4th, and the next is on Dec 11th. Not many 🌈🤖00's. This is more than coincidence.

Now we all know the 🌈🤖have powered up and SkyNet is coming for us, but the questions remains; *Were there enough* 🧻🦍*to allow the shorts to exit?* or was it mostly just 🌈🤖playing Ring Around the Rosie and passing plague ridden tissues to each other while the foundations of Melvin and Citadel start to crumble.

You think that holding will make it squeeze. But holding is not enough. The price needs to increase to create a squeeze, so you need to buy.

Last weeks were exceptional. Market makers were unprepared (gamma squeeze) and had to buy stock, which helped increase the price. That won't happen again.

Since market makers won't help your cause (buy), you have to do it yourself. But you all agree that it is priced above fundamental value. So basically you want people to buy an overvalued stock, in the hope that other people buy into an even more overvalued stock.

I was fun while it lasted. I wish the outcome was different and that the price would have gone to $1000+, but the momentum was killed on Thursday.

There is not a next GME. That's not a thing, so stop saying it is. Okay, with that out of the way here we go:

Last week on January 24th, Nancy Pelosi's husband disclosed buying 4 different tickers. The tickers were TSLA, AAPL, DIS, and AB. Most of the mainstream media were very focused on talking about the TSLA, AAPL, and DIS yet only very briefly mention the fact he bought 20,000 shares of AB. I found this particular stock pick very odd in comparison to TSLA, AAPL, and DIS. It's an odd pick because

A. I hadn't ever heard of ticker AB before reading this story. And

B. Paul Pelosi bought deep ITM calls on TSLA, AAPL, and DIS. AKA calls any smooth brain could make. These calls are super safe long term plays, and require no brain power or risk for how deep in the money they are. In comparison to those three companies, he bought SHARES of AB. I found this extremely odd. For those reasons, I began to look into the company to attempt to see why he made this purchase in particular.

After non-extensive research I came to two different possible conclusions why he would buy shares of AB with as high conviction as TSLA, AAPL, and DIS:

1. He liked the high dividend yield of 7.72% and the slow yet steady upward projectory of the stock. OR
2. He knows something I don't.

So, because I am retarded I went with number 2 and YOLO'd 30 Apr 19 45$ calls @ .50 cent strike price. I will hold these calls with diamond hands and we'll see what happens.

The results must have been known since mit December and substantial parts of the results already in November! Remember the last person for phase 1 was recruited in November and primary completion of the study in early December !

And again - phase 1 is an open label study (no blinding for anybody !). Vaxart knows the data the very moment when their laboratory machines give their results (e.g neutralising antibody titers from an ELISA Test)

Vaxart must know the results since many weeks.

Why does it take so long? Phase 1 is a relatively small study. The reason is the talks which are behind the scene. While we get Hamster results, I am confident that Vaxart had several meetings with OWS and WHO COVAX committee talking about large multi hundred million dose production.

It is only consistent that Vaxart is hiring so many highly qualified and well paid staff as indicated on their website: all prepared for large scale production. Contractor is secured as well. All is set.

I would not even exclude that we may not get phase 1 results today before the conference if anything is still to be negotiated between Vaxart and OWS or Vaxart and WHO. This could even further delay the announcement.

It is also possible that we first get phase 1 results today before the NY Academie of science meeting and then followed in some days by OWS and/or WHO announcement.

In any case if we do not get news Premarket - this would be indicative that something very big goes on behind the scene. But zero doubt that the phase 1 data would disappoint.

Whether attributed to more retail investor involvement, stimulus from the government, lack of spending elsewhere, the Fed, etc, some companies are the chosen ones for the high valuations while others don't get the privilege of being among WallStreet's favored.

&#x200B;

For the apes / autists in the group, company valuation is also called the market cap. It's the share price \* outstanding shares (not just float shares).

&#x200B;

GME Market Cap (Valuation) at $300/share assuming the number of outstanding shares is constant, would roughly be $21b ($300 \* 69.75M shares).  The main metric to compare companies valuation justification is the EPS or earnings per share. This is often just called a multiple. That is, if the EPS is $1 for the year, the PE is 300 at a $300/share price.

&#x200B;

Generally, companies within the same industry would have similar PE ratios but it depends if it's been blessed or not by the WallStreet powers.

&#x200B;

According to CIS Market, the average PE ratio for Internet, Mail Order, and Online Shops is 77.13 with the retail sector overall at 47.36. Ulta Beauty Inc (ULTA) which is an in-person salon retail has a wopping 72.42 valuation with an annual consensus of $3.94 EPS. Source: [https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry\_Valuation.php?s=1300](https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry_Valuation.php?s=1300).

&#x200B;

Now GME does have some baggage in that it hasn't had a profitable year in 3 years with the pandemic really hurting it. In addition, its debt to assets ratio has been steadily rising since 2017 to as high as 87% as of Q3 2020. But, the turn around has been looking good with it's profit margins as well increasing and the last EPS of -$0.29 was a massive surprise to the estimate of -$0.85. The consensus for the year is -$2.07. But when there is a mass pandemic and people aren't shopping, I would say this is pretty good all things considering.

&#x200B;

🚀🚀🚀🚀Now, given Ryan Cohen's appointment in helping the company make a more digital transformation, the challenge will be capital. Innovation and growth costs. GameStop has a lot of assets though in the form of real estate. If they are able to reduce costs while growing their digital footprint both through game services like Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, or Steam, and eCommerce sales for older nostalgia games, they could very well reach $3-$5 EPS within a couple of years (that is roughly $0.75 - $1.25 per quarter). At a $4 EPS (in between the two), this is only a 75 PE ratio which is not farfetched at all especially inline with the Internet / Online Shops industry as the company reinvents itself. While debt will continue to be a drag on the company in the short-term, I think there is plenty of opportunity for GME to innovate here. 🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

What Wall Street doesn't want you to see is that they've valued and supported bullishly many other companies at high valuations. TSLA P/E ratio is 1,380.65 whereas the current auto industry PE is 20.4. Toyota is 14.86. Even some of Wall Street called TSLA the 4-WTF Chart of the year - [https://wolfstreet.com/2020/12/12/tesla-the-quadruple-wtf-chart-of-the-year-it-should-just-sell-shares-on-autopilot-at-huge-prices-and-exit-sordid-business-of-making-cars/](https://wolfstreet.com/2020/12/12/tesla-the-quadruple-wtf-chart-of-the-year-it-should-just-sell-shares-on-autopilot-at-huge-prices-and-exit-sordid-business-of-making-cars/), but alas all the bears have kinda called it quits on TSLA with short interest at it's all time low. The valuation doesn't scare them with price targets above $1k. The difference? Enough people said f-u WallStreet, we like the company and believe in it so we are going to buy it and hold and don't care what you say and do.

I know a lot of you are looking for confirmation that you should still hold, the truth is that may or may not be in your best interest. Only you can decide will all the information you have what’s best. Don’t listen to random people online.

However I’m going to let you know why I’m still holding. I bought in with a average price of $56 and a lot of the shares bought below $100 will be held by people who haven’t sold yet and aren’t planning on. Institutions and smart investors with a good amount of shares (*200+*) are currently holding, mostly paper hands (people who jumped on because of media/word of mouth) are gone now and they most likely didn’t have a big amount of shares anyway. We also temporarily lost swing traders because of the restrictions and loss of momentum, people with big balances who seen big dips as swinging opportunities (*$124 to $300 for example*) yes they sell but when they buy it brings pressure back and the price up which brings confidence for other people to invest in. I still think SI is high and HF aren’t out the game yet. With how high the SI is and the low float I think we would have seen a lot more volume on Wednesday/Thursday/Friday. The whole world was buying so this kind of volume to me even if it was HF unloading dosent signal them unwinding. 

*So what’s the game plan?*

Well firstly I think the HF couldn’t have let the whole world buy shares and have a short squeeze, they would be in to much debt and the price may very well have gone past $2000 due to a massive amount of people buying (*people normally not involved in stocks*) and the HF would of become insolvent. What I think the HF did is allow retail to buy during the week with Melvin unwinding their position, then once retail buying pressure starts to decrease due to people already in the stock, start to coordinate together with other HFs to restrict buying on some brokers (*decrease buying pressure*) and slow down the momentum caused by the internet and people talking about the squeeze. They would then let people sell and induce FUD which changed the narrative and worked, the price is now at a more comfortable level for them $90. On the 09/02/21 we will see latest SI (*2 weeks ago date*) and I’m assuming it will still be over 100%. They will try to bring price as low as they can but there will be a people with large amount of shares bought early they won’t fold (*some can’t sell*). When good earnings come out and in addition to Cohen turning the company around and increasing the valuation until fair price is $100. 

Then we may see the HFs unwind and the short squeeze would happen, at a much lower price for them as to not have to buy back shares at $500+ also with less people involved (*retail got bored/lost too much money and isn’t financially involved with GME*) there will be less competition to buy shares. They don’t want the whole world’s eyes on them during the squeeze. This is a waiting game for institutions and smart money. If you have the money and time to hold it would be smart or to make a position at there’s prices would also be smart. We wait for Cohen to turn the company around which would tell everyone who’s shorting this company that it will be fair valued at $100 and they (*shorts*) would not be able to bankrupt the company or get the share price back to where they or originally shorted it.

TL;DR - HF still have to initiate MOASS. Not yet though people need to hold for Cohen to take action and creat a positive outlook for the company, HF wouldn’t want to pay interest on a company whose valuation will be going up for years. They would unwind.

Reading this you will learn: 
1. $BBBY has a constant uptrend 
2. $BBBY has staying power 
3. $BBBY’s uptrend will continue through the Summer and possibly Fall 
4. $BBBY stock will not only give you a Short Squeeze opportunity, But is has long value of 10% in 6 months over its current price



AT ITS CURRENT PRICE $BBBY HAS LONG TREND VALUE (EVEN AT 6 MONTHS). During this Cycle (which I’m starting after the Covid correction in March) $BBBY has had a fairly constant Uptrend that, even after the first January correction, has a trend that still lines up with the troughs on the higher-low line: https://imgur.com/dhbfPzw


$BBBY is a healthy company, but so called ‘smart money’ thinks there is going to be a downturn in home goods when the Covid stuff ends. Buying home goods during the Stay-at-Home orders is what they call “Nesting.” which is why so many of them shorted the stock, but $BBBY will be fine for at least the next 6 months, or even 9 months. We’re not going to be leaving our houses for the next few months anyways, which will continue the “Nesting” trend for another good quarter or two, and it will take investors a few down quarters to start frowning on $BBBY. So that means current investors are HOLDING. That brings the trend price based on the higher-low line to about $33 in July, 10%+ where the current stock price is at: https://imgur.com/ml6swYO


NOW HERE’S THE BEST PART: Most Apes on here who pay attention know that this stock is shorted by 65%. Here’s a list if you’re new: https://imgur.com/Nm4hsxQ


Of all the companies on this list, $BBBY is the only one with a very healthy trend line compared to it’s current stock price. Even at a stock price between $25-$30, which is above $BBBY’s current ‘Higher-Low’ trend line, in 5 months $BBBY will be worth $33. There is still a 10% growth there. A LOT OF RETAIL AND INSTUTIONAL INVESTORS ARE HIP TO THIS, AND THEY LIKE THE STOCK, SO THEY ARE HOLDING!


If another GME Sort-Squeeze is going to go KABOOM on another stock, its probably going to happen to $BBBY and soon. The last settlement date for shorts was on Friday with 51 Million shares, but have 11 days to cover. The Next settlement date, Monday, February 14th, 62.5 million shares have only 5 days to cover. On February 28th, 64 million shares will need to be settled with only 5 days to cover. https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bbby/short-interest


If $BBBY is a healthy stock that has a current price under $30 and a long price of $33 for July 2021 (10%+ its current value), it’s being shorted at 62%, retail and intuitional investors are holding, and 126million+ shares are going to have to be settled by the end of February….


Here’s my observations on why Bed Bath & Beyond $BBBY stock is going to be healthy for a long time. I call them the “Doubles”:


DOUBLE THE AMOUNT GATHERINGS AT OTHER PEOPLE’S HOMES IN 2021! “Hedge Fund” belief is that when the pandemic is over there is going to be a mad desire for larger than life gatherings like Concerts and such. That is true, but there’s going to be long ramp up period for that. However, a year full of missed birthday parties, anniversary parties, retirement parties, youth sport team parties, divorce parties, dessert and campaign parties (these are actually pretty fun. I don’t drink btw, I go for the deserts), cookout for the hell of it parties, etc… are going to happen at an accelerated Rate in 2021. Did you know Bed Bath & Beyond sells party supplies? I’m not talking about just paper plates and napkins; I’m talking about serving platters, serving utensils, electric food warming trays, beverage tubs, margarita machines, kegerators, bathroom towels, random stuff to make your house look nicer when guests come over… all the stuff someone would want for a party.
People don’t have time to wait for an online order to show up when they’re preparing for a party, especially if they need those items the day of. So they go to the store to get it when they think about it.


DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF EXTENDED STAYS AT FAMILY AND FRIEND’S HOMES! Long distance family and friends haven’t seen each other IN PERSON for a long time and reunions are going to be #1 on peoples travel list. Couch surfing and guest rooms are going to be the top destination for most people in 2021. Smart Money thinks there are a ton people out there with the money spend on Cruises and trips to Disneyland? Hogwash! People are going to be visiting their family “Back Home” or traveling to Boston so their 4-year-old daughter can meet her cousins in person. And the hosts for these guest roomers and couch surfers are going to update their hospitality amenities (such as clean sheets, towels, toothbrush holders). Many of them wont have time to wait for an online delivery; they’re going to need those items NOW. And where will they update guest hospitality items right now? BED BATH AND BEYOND!


DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF WEDDING REGISTRYS! All the weddings that got canceled last year are going to happen this year. Plus all the weddings that are supposed to happen this year are also going to happen this year. And do you know what is attached to all those damn Wedding Invitations? A Wedding Registry! And where are all of them registered at? BED BATH & BEYOND! May-August going to be Diamond Hands for them.
Here’s a great vomit-inducing article about the increase in weddings in 2021 & 2022 because people like links in these DDs: https://www.insider.com/weddings-will-be-more-expensive-after-pandemic-2022-2021-1


DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF STUFF FOR COLLEGE DORM ROOMS! A ton of new college kids didn’t move into their dorms last year which means double the tonnage of new college kid will be moving in this year. And those college kids are going to need sheets, blankets, pillows, towels, shower caddys, lamps, etc… And Mom is going to want to shop with their kid to buy that stuff together. Andy where are they going to shop for that? BED BATH & BEYOND


WORK FROM HOME IS HERE TO STAY! Sure, you might say people already stocked up home stuff during the lockdown and that buying binge is over. ITS NOT OVER –ITS NOW HERE TO STAY! And when you get squirrely stuck at home with nothing to do, sometime you go out and buy stuff for your home. Its like: “You know what I need? A new coffeemaker. Lets go get one right now.” Or, “Remember how so and so’s dishes all matched each other, lets go get some matching dishes right now.” When squirrely hits, you aren’t going to wait around for an online delivery, you’re going to go get it NOW.


 $BBBY is a good stock. The company is liquid, there is a need for their goods, and they offer convenience for immediate purchases. Plus, lots of people and companies already own the stock with no intention of selling. Its financial stability, firm upward trend, and staying power already have it as a HOLD or LONG by 4 out of 5 reporting agencies, which is what conservative money looks at. Bed Bath & Beyond is already reported to have a good quarterly report coming next week, plus all the variables I laid out are going to continue the company’s positive earnings for the year.


Oh yea, some Key company factors: 
1. As per their last report they got $2.2 billion in the bank. They’re Liquid 
2. 15 million have downloaded their store app 
3. 2.2 million new online customers last year 
4. Other important financials that IDK what they’re about 
5. They dumped all their subsidiaries and now just focus on one thing, Convenient Home Goods!

$SCHW just release its daily average trade summary for January 2021.

It has seen daily average trade growth from 5.13 million in October all the way to 10.3million by the end of January.

This number will continue to increase as retail investors growth continues to boom and upset traders on Etoro, Robinhood, Webull and Interactive broker flee to Vangaurd/Fidelity/TD/Schwab the few companies who didn't restrict trading.

**Revenue Sensitivity (daily average trades)**

Taken directly from their winter business update which was released online yesterday.

[https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schw\_2021\_winter\_business\_update\_020221.pdf](https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schw_2021_winter_business_update_020221.pdf)

Calculating revenue growth just on the daily average trades we can see that they will be experience increased revenues this quarter of:

10,326 - 6,543 (average daily trades for all last quarter) = 3,782/ 100 \* 60M = 2.2 Billion increase in revenues just as a result of increased daily trades. This is assuming the 10,326 daily trades stays flat for the rest of the quarter. I expect the daily trades to continue to rise as a result of increased retailer activity and market trend. Lets say 2.5 Billion increase as a result of retail investor growth.

To put this in perspective they reported 4.1 Billion in revenue in Q4 last quarter. If they are to report 6.5 Billion plus this stock will jump 30%+ next earnings. Combined with cost savings with the TD merger Net income will see a increase of over 100% from last quarter

**Margin Balances:**

Schwab had to restrict the use of margin balances on select stocks during the January boom as retail investors started to opt to use margin to increase their holdings and risk. Margin usage has seen a drastic increase per their Q4 statements and I expect Q1 to follow suit with continued growth.

**Part 1 DD Summary:**

**Average Daily users:** 20% increase from the October 2020 numbers to December 2020 alone. The January numbers will even be substantially higher with TD Ameritrade and Schwab both reporting network strain due to the influx of new investors signing up last week to get into GME/AMC/BB. This trend wont be stopping anytime soon, the retail investor's strength is gaining. Just look at Wallstreetbets alone we had 2.2 million members as of Monday and now we are sitting at 7 million.

**Future/Longevity of Brokerages:**

Etoro, Webull and RH will be facing lawsuites and scrutiny as a result of their trade restrictions. Do you want your money sitting in a brokerage with possible liquidly issues as a result of lawsuites.

**Balance Sheet Strength:**

Schwab has the strongest balance sheet of any brokerage on the market. With Trillions of dollars under management. This means that they will not need to restrict purchasing power of shares when there are substantial new deposits.

**Quote directly from Mark Cuban's AMA:**

When you load back up, fight a broker with TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS in assets on their balance sheet. Someone that can be there when the fight starts and wont blink an eye.

**GME and AMC Round 2**

For any future short squeeze traders will need to transfer their accounts to Schwab/TD/Fidelity to make sure their are no trade restrictions and bullshit manipulation. Schwab/TD and Fidelity are the only brokerages who have strong enough balance sheets to support future potential squeezes.

**Monthly Activity Report**

Schwab releases monthly activity report 2 weeks after the most recent month. This report will summarize daily trade growth, new deposits, new brokerage accounts. This report is expected in the next 2 weeks. Most likely on the 15th. $SCHW will explode similar to what IBKR did this week when these results are issued. This is your chance to get in cheap with $SCHW trading at 15% of its high and 25% off its recent price targets which were issued prior to this retail growth frenzy.

**TLDR:** Schwab is undervalued thanks to market sell off and will fly come February 15th when January activity report is released. It will run back to its ATH's in the mid 60s thanks to new customer deposits/transfers from shit brokerages and daily trade growth. 

I expected Schwab to report revenue of 6.5B plus this quarter or a 50% increase from prior quarter with net income increasing 50-100% as a result of the TD merger cost synergies. This stock will be trading at over $100 come earnings in April

Calls are cheap.

For any future short squeeze traders will need to transfer their accounts to Schwab/TD/Fidelity to make sure their are no trade restrictions and bullshit manipulation. Schwab/TD and Fidelity are the only brokerages who have strong enough balance sheets to support future potential squeezes.

**Monthly Activity Report**

Schwab releases monthly activity report 2 weeks after the most recent month. This report will summarize daily trade growth, new deposits, new brokerage accounts. This report is expected in the next 2 weeks. Most likely on the 15th. $SCHW will explode similar to what IBKR did this week when these results are issued. This is your chance to get in cheap with $SCHW trading at 15% of its high and 25% off its recent price targets which were issued prior to this retail growth frenzy.

**TLDR:** Schwab is undervalued thanks to market sell off and will fly come February 15th when January activity report is released. It will run back to its ATH's in the mid 60s thanks to new customer deposits/transfers from shit brokerages and daily trade growth.

I expected Schwab to report revenue of 6.5B plus this quarter or a 50% increase from prior quarter with net income increasing 50-100% as a result of the TD merger cost synergies. This stock will be trading at over $100 come earnings in April

Calls are cheap.

Irwin simon, the CEO of Aphria, has a track record for aggressive expansion. He brings a unique background who specializes in M&As. Aphria’s recent acquisition of SweetWater was a strategic play to expand into US & more importantly, creating brand awareness. 

>We will establish and grow our U.S. presence through SweetWater's robust, profitable platform of craft brewing innovation, manufacturing, marketing and distribution expertise. At the same time, we will build brand awareness for our adult-use cannabis brands, Broken Coast, Good Supply, Riff and Solei, through our participation in the growing $29 billion craft brew market in the U.S. ahead of potential future state or federal cannabis legalization

[Riff](https://uspto.report/TM/90383302)  

[Solei](https://uspto.report/TM/90383374)

Irwin is leveraging SweetWater's existing infrastructure to accelerate Aphria's entry into the U.S. ahead of federal legalization of cannabis to fuel sustainable profitable growth

I recently made a post in regards to [The Rolling 20’s - LEAPs on Cannabis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lab9sk/the_rolling_20s_leaps_on_cannabis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) where I highlight long term opportunities the marijuana industry presents with US legalization on the horizon. This is happeneing at an extreme rate & Aphria will be positioning itself as a top tier brand in the US through SweetWater.

Look at the Pluto TV acquisition from VIAC and you see the winner winner chicken dinner, WS is betting on the wrong streaming play with Netflix, look at the future of streaming and subscription fatigue. Pluto TV is the cure. There has been a lot of press and DD but no one is paying attention, investor day is 23 days away. After 2-24 no one will doubt the future of streaming and the fast partnership with Netflix and narcos proves it. I don’t think NFLX is a bad play. I did last year and was wrong but if you look at their current path to profitability it intersects hard with Pluto tv and Viacomcbs production capacity for streaming additional content. 

from the library licensing deals to the possibility of a new Chapelle show on Netflix owned in part by viac as part of a big deal with Dave to the Pluto TV Narcos deal cited in the last earnings call we can see a huge leap forward for streaming overall based entirely on the NFLX VIAC relationship. Monetization is a long term process for some of these pieces of big content and after a period of time it will no longer add new subs like narcos. 

But Pluto Tv can help with ad based monetization and no sub or sign in required. If you look at the overall package we see  that more shows could follow like ozark or maybe a sopranos channel for syndication like monetization a&e tried with no cursing but fuck that shit. 

If you missed the point don’t feel bad your like most of Wall Street today. VIAC is value in plain sight and it’s a growth stock in a hyper growth sector. We won’t see another streaming opportunity like this. After investor day on 2-24 the world will realize what has been silently growing for years. This is a huge opportunity and I’ve posted my positions before but I will again.

Look at the trends coming from Netflix and Amazon who both look at Viac for content production capacity.

Over the past few days, the level of hedge fund short interest in GameStop fell sharply. Or did it?

On the evening of Monday, Feb. 1, Bloomberg reported that “GameStop Short Interest Plunges in Sign Traders Are Covering.”

Two separate research firms, IHS Markit and S3 Partners, reported the drop:

“Short interest in the video-game retailer plummeted to 39% of free-floating shares, from 114% in mid-January, according to IHS Markit Ltd. data. Data from S3 Partners, another market intelligence firm, showed a similar pattern, with GameStop’s short sales having fallen to about 50% of its total stock available to trade, down from a high of roughly 140% reached earlier this year.”

The reporting coincided with a big drop in the value of GME shares. This is clear evidence that the hedge funds are winning, and that the Reddit army is losing.

Unless the short interest data is being manipulated, which is also a real possibility.

If the U.S. Congress does any real digging when it holds hearings on the GameStop situation, it will uncover some very interesting quirks of the market, many of them revolving around shorting practices.

Most people understand “naked shorting” to be an illegal thing, and it is — sort of.

On the other hand, there are plenty of instances where naked shorting is more of a gray area — not so much a violation of the law as a minor infraction worthy of a parking ticket — and other instances where certain players can short a stock beyond 100% of the float, or short nakedly, in a wholly legal way.

This is where the reported sharp decline in GameStop (GME) short interest gets intriguing.

There are at least two plausible explanations for GME short interest declining — giving the appearance of hedge funds covering more than half their shorts — even as the GME share price fell sharply alongside.

The first explanation is that GME squeezers lost their discipline and broke ranks.

If a critical mass of holders on the long side of GME started selling to realize profit in GME, that would have given the hedge funds an opportunity to cover their shorts — via buying back their shares — at progressively lower levels as the share price fell.

Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out.

The notion that the squeezers broke ranks, and that the hedge funds are winning, is certainly the perception that was created. The Bloomberg article strongly suggested that the Reddit army has lost.

“Short squeezes can only last as long as there is a large short position in a stock,” the chief market strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. told Bloomberg. “Once that dissipates, the situation changes completely.”

But there is another possibility, which is that the hedge fund short interest in GME didn’t really dissipate.

If the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time.

That is because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions. 

In this second scenario, though, the hedge funds that are short — with tens of billions of dollars on the line — could have decided to play a high-stakes trick.

The trick would be: “Make it look like we’ve covered our shorts when we really haven’t (because we can’t), so that short interest falls and the Reddit army gets demoralized, thus breaking the squeeze.”

The way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market.

The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013.

The SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.” You can read it here via the SEC website.

The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here’s a quick rundown:

If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.
A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.
The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.
This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.
As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.
The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.
It gets very complicated, very fast.

But the gist is that hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered, and can’t, for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.

Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:

“Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.”

In plain language, “Trader A” in SEC parlance could intentionally be giving the appearance of closing their illegal short position — when in reality they have no intention of doing so (or no ability to do so).

Under normal circumstances, tricks like these were used to help hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren’t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located.

The GameStop squeeze is a unique scenario, however, because it is a very public fight to the finish between the Reddit army and the hedge funds that are short. Either the Reddit army wins and the hedge funds pay four-digit prices ($1,000 or more) to cover their shorts because of margin calls, or the hedge funds win and the GME share price falls back to the low double-digits.

In a battle like that, with public coverage influencing both sides, perception is a weapon. As such, if the hedge funds can generate the appearance of having covered most of their shorts, while driving down the GME share price through aggressive selling on low volume (something known as a “short ladder attack”), then the hedge funds increase their odds of breaking the squeeze — in part because media outlets will report things like “GameStop Short Interest Plunges” without looking deeper.

To be clear, it is also possible the first scenario is true.

GameStop shares may have fallen precipitously, with hedge fund short interest falling alongside, because a critical mass of long GME holders simply lost faith and tried to sell before the squeeze was complete. 

But it makes a lot of sense to question that narrative, given the wide array of deceptive tricks that some hedge funds (certainly not all of them, or even most of them) have used to perpetuate questionable or even illegal shorting tactics for a very long time.

And again, these tricks are so pervasive and old, the SEC wrote a “risk alert” memo about them in 2013.

As such, whether the drop in GameStop short interest was real or smoke and mirrors, the fact that changes in the level of short interest can be faked — with hedge funds making it look like they have closed out, but haven’t — is a serious compliance loophole that should be forcefully addressed.

As a side note, the answer to this problem likely resides in the (removed)

Apart from market maker privileges, the three big reasons hedge funds can play games with short positions — delayed reporting requirements, time windows of days (or even weeks in some cases) for trades to settle, and related transactions being executed in different places, or with different counterparties, for the sake of deception — could all be answered with a (removed)-based settling and clearing system where transactions are noted instantly and made visible to all parties (plus the SEC)."|2021-02-03 17:05:16.030449|../output/raw/2021/02/03/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170519.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['OTM', 'TLDR', 'I', 'IHS', 'IHS', 'GME', 'U', 'S', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'SEC', 'SHO', 'SEC', 'A', 'A', 'SEC', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'SEC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'SEC']|['IHS', 'IHS', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'SHO', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Anything over 50% in short ratio means they couldn't have covered overall for the day because a majority of the trades were shorts (math, people). Also, this data is showing only **short** sale data; it doesn't include regular share sales.

If someone could overlay this with the volume / price chart, it'd be helpful to see what that looks like.

Source: [FINRA SHO Daily Short Volume](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html). It takes samples of short sale data from different markets, so you won't see the same total volume numbers, but the ratio (%) should be the same across all markets (statistics, people). This is different from short interest (a bi-monthly reported figure) but this is a good daily representation of the number of short trades.

They priced a secondary offering from an insider lock up at $35, providing a strong floor (thus my short puts at $35.

You all heard about that Kathie Wood, sister to Tiger Woods and Woodie Woodpecker. ARKK (her investment firm), identified TSLA early as a potentially exponential company. Ever since the TSLA stock split, I have been going through ARKKs ETF exposure and been looking into further firms that have an angle.

I have been looking into three areas of ARKK:

* EV
* Genomics
* Technological Advancements

While the first two are clear and there should be some exposure to it in your portfolios or bets, I was specifically interested in the third category.

**Introducing Stratasys SSYS**

The company has quite a solid foundation. It is one of the leading 3D-printing companies. Makerbot? The biggest brand in 3D Printing? Yep, Stratasys. I come from a background where 3D printing has become the absolute industry standard and we are going to see it becoming the standard in mass manufacture, too. I am speaking metal and carbon 3d-printing. Let me tell you, carbon printing is already better than part molding and every company on earth is starting to use it. I am talking car manufacturers, shipyards, small-scale prototypers, the cycling industry, the airplane industry, everyone. With SSYS you aren't jumping on a company that sells shovels during the gold rush. Your jumping on the company that gives everyone the chance to build their own damn shovel. Taking the bet on SSYS is not a ""Next Friday"" moment, you are rather looking into a growth over time chance. The beauty of this badger is: the current evaluation is under 3 billion.

The sad thing? You are too late. It is trading ~~near the ATH~~ at the highest level of the last 5 years. But hear me out, the real kicker is if you look at the charts. After the last earnings, there wasn't much movement. But then, during the overexposre of ARKK through TSLAs growth, someone has been buying in tranches day after day for nearly 2 months now. My theory is, institutional investors are starting to copy ARKKs investment strategy, loading up on different companies ARKK has been invested in. So yes this baby will fly higher because as far as I see it, there hasn't been much exposure to the retail world yet.

&#x200B;

[Ever since november its been a straight ramp up](https://preview.redd.it/5ubqsnoby9f61.png?width=1892&format=png&auto=webp&s=94786daf76ba06ce57ddba65cc7e3912e53d56d6)

Why it will go up:

* Solid economics (200+k revenue per employee)
* Overall growth in the next 2Y will continue
* Exposure to exponential growth potential in 3D printing
* Low overall market cap (sub 3bn)
* Linear purchases over the last 2 months, seemingly larger investor with stepped investing strategy
* Not speculative: They have products, they are generating revenue, the fundamentals are working
* Perfectly in place at the right time
* No high volatility, IV is superfine if you are into calls
* Connected to other hypes: 3D Printing for EVs, Medical, and others.
* Covid situation independent, except for 3rd world war scenarios

The risks:

* ~~Trading too ATH, triggering additional capitalisation~~ (See edit, its trading its highest in the last 5Y but about 1/3 of its ATH. The risk therefore is more something like: 5 Year High could trigger additional capitalisation)
* Competition getting too good, driving revenue down (unlikely)
* Some early investor dropping out
* ARKK reducing their exposure or killing of SSYS publicly

**Edit:** Thanks to /u/YahyaJ - SSYS is nowhere near its ATH. ATH was at 136, were now at 49.

**Where I see it flying**

I think SSYS is going to steadily grow more and more accelerated. This steady growth will not stay under the radar, especially not when retail starts to look at the different investments ARKK is exposed to. I think within the next three months it will add another 30-40% through institutional investors and ETFs cloning ARKK. If you look at their exposure chart, ARKK even had to reduce their amount of SSYS for it to stabilise it's % in the ETF: [https://cathiesark.com/arkk-holdings-of-ssys](https://cathiesark.com/arkk-holdings-of-ssys). This runup has been to mechanical to ignore, inspite of it trading to ~~ATH~~ the highest level of the last 5 years.

I don't think its ready for a retail investor runup, aka: its not going to pop. But it is going to steadily climb, which should give a nice return on calls and stock. If it goes down in value (which it did during the covid dip), it will still be a valuable company that will one day pop off. There is no real bagholding exposure at this price level. You are investing in a technology that **will** rule the world and in a company that is ready to take the scepter. Options are a significant risk though.

**The rest**

I do not yet have a position, except for a few stocks I bought to track the stock (lul) and they made about 120% since november (damn). I will take a bigger one soon and will post my update here.

For options: Watch. the. spread!

Whats the WSB take?

However I wanna have a closer look at the company itself and why it could be a good investment for short/medium term gains, because that's why we are playing this game called stock market.

XL Fleet ($XL) transforms existing commercial vehicles, e.g. small trucks into electric vehicles. Unlike many SPACs, they have an actual product that is already battle tested, and yes, it has also produced revenue. Revenue, that is set to increased **exponentially** as mentioned below. Now here are couple of interesting points that made me a believer:

* $350m in cash with NO material debt
* Run by MIT alumnis with CEO's impressive records at McKinsey, GM
* Jon Ledecky as board member - he's the majority owner at NY Islanders and the company he founded in the 90's was the fastest entrant to Fortune 500
* Two analyst recently began coverage with $30 PT. Current share price as of 31.1. is $18.98
* 2024 revenue forecast is $1.377 billion; current market cap $2.493B ! -> company says accessible market is 1 trillion $
* EBITDA positive results projected for 2022
* All government vehicles to be turned electric - XL has the fastest solution to this and they've already known to have collaborated with public institutions
* Other customers include e.g. Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Verizon, DHL
* PIPE shares that were unleashed in the market recently created lot of downward pressure for the stock - that should be over soon
* Hyped by Cramer, gave a lot of Mad Money air time going through their business case

Price targets and analyst coverages:

* BTIG initiated analyst coverage with $30 PT:[https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3231730&headline=XL-XL-Fleet-initiated-with-a-Buy-at-BTIG](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3231730&headline=XL-XL-Fleet-initiated-with-a-Buy-at-BTIG)

This is not an investment advice and I recommend you all do your DD. All kinds of discussion is very welcomed, thanks am out.

EDIT: GME to the moon with diamond hands. However this should be an interesting play moving forward so keep an eye on my boys at $XL whether it's before or after GME saga is over

Now back to the issue at hand:

A while back while reading the comments on an $NNDM DD in here, I came across a guy who said $NVMI is even better than NNDM but he's not going to write a DD on it or promote it any other way on WSB. Since I like forbidden fruits, I went ahead and did my own research on the company. I'm sharing the results with you:

Nova Measuring Instruments is an Israel-based company (with 18 offices worldwide) that provides metrology solutions (devices and software) for advanced process control used in semiconductor manufacturing.

Metrology means measuring, and in this context, super precise measuring (nanometer or smaller) required for semiconductor manufacturing. The company's metrology solutions use technologies including Optical Scatterometry, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), x-ray fluorescence (XRF), scatterometry modeling software, and high-performance computing. The company holds 30 patents in this field.

Market cap: \~2.2 Billion

P/E ratio: \~42

Has beaten earning expectations in the past 4 quarters (didn't check further back)

The stock price has grown almost 100% in the last year, which is good but nothing compared to NNDM, for instance, which has grown 540%.

Daily volume is low (about 150,000)

In a recent (Jan 28, 2021) [press release](https://www.novami.com/investors/press-releases/nova-receives-multiple-materials-metrology-orders-from-leading-logic-and-foundry-customers/), the company announced that it ""received multiple orders from multiple leading Logic and Foundry customers for its most advanced materials metrology solutions.""  They don't name the new clients, but could one of them be $TSM?

Anyway, we know that all sorts of trendy technologies such as EVs, AI, Cloud, etc. need processors and memory devices, which brings our attention to companies such as $AMD, $INTC, $ON, and $TSM. But these companies in turn need precise measuring devices for their process control, and NVMI is the leader in that area.

The company's technology/patents can also be useful in 3D printers that print precise things (again, such as NNDM).

I did a quick search and it seems no one has done a DD on this in WSB. I think it has great growth potential both short term and long term. Once WB is over the BANG stocks, this is something worth a look at. IMO, it will be similar to stocks like MGNI and SE that consistently move up without much buzz around them on WSB.

&#x200B;

Technicals:

I don't know much about technicals but according to tradingview, it's neutral based on oscillators, and strong buy based on moving averages.

I have seen many good quality DD about Corsair. We all know it’s a great business.

What I want to focus on is the financials. More specifically: **We already know Q4 results and nobody is talking about it! Why? Because nobody looked!!!**

Corsair recently posted a prospectus related to the sale of 7.5M shares by some insiders (totally normal as it’s mostly the private equity owner – EagleTree - selling a small bit and passing from 78.32% to 68.55% ownership - they sold 7,135,000 out of the 7,500,000 sold… It’s totally fair for the PE owner to cash out a bit).

Here’s the **prospectus (dated 21st of January 2021**): [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33)

**1)** Now, check out page 9 of the document

**For the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect:**

**• Net revenue to be between approximately $1,700 million and $1,701 million**

**• Net income to be between approximately $101 million and $103 million**

**• Adjusted EBITDA to be between approximately $211 and $213 million**

Yes, we already know they have beaten their own updated estimates…

In fact, the company initially estimated the following (*from Q3 release* [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))

For the full year 2020, we currently expect:

• Net revenue to be in the range of $1,616 million to $1,631 million.

• Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $178 million to $184 million.

• Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $187 million to $193 million.

Then, they updated the *guidance on November 30th 2020* ([https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook](https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook)):

For the full year 2020, we currently expect:

* Net revenue to be in the range of $1,651 million to $1,666 million.
* Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $186 million to $192 million.
* Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $194 million to $200 million.

**So they have beaten their own initial and revisited estimates. Great!! Really great!!**

**2)** But that’s not all we can easily infer from the Prospectus dated January 21, 2021 (Again… we just need to look).

As they mention on the Q3 report, “as of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $370.1 million”.

In the more recent prospectus (page 10):

*In addition to the foregoing, as of December 31, 2020, we expect to have approximately $133 million in cash and restricted cash and we expect to have net debt of approximately $194 million following the repayment of $50.0 million in existing debt with cash on hand during the quarter ended December 31, 2020.*

**This means that they have reduced net debt from $250M ($370 - $120 of cash) to $194M, which implies $56M of free cash flow generated during the quarter.** As a reminder, they generated around 21M FCF in q3 2020 and 94M in the first 9 months of 2020. So **this implies around 150M FCF in 2020** (as a reference in the first 9 months of 2019, they had negative FCF of about 6M).

(check cash flow statement at page 14 on the Q3 report here [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))

At $39, Corsair has a 3.5Bn market cap (91.92M of shares outstanding).

This is a very respectable cash flow yield of 4.2%. I’d be expecting a much lower yield from a company growing as fast as Corsair is (60.7% growth year-over-year in Q3 and, assuming sales of 554M for Q4 vs 327M for Q4 2019, a growth of 69.4% in Q4).

Now, you must be thinking: but the smart money already knows this! They have accounted for it!

I used to be like you… I used to think the market was efficient and that big funds and banks were always looking carefully at things!

No f\*\*\* way!!!

Take a look at Goldman Sachs’ research from February 1st 2021 (yes, after the prospectus was published).

Someone shared it on reddit

They still base themselves on the updated guidance of November 30th 2020. No mention whatsoever of the much more recently updated “guidance” (more than a guidance, it’s actually the results given how close the ranges are…)

**TLDR**: Corsair is a great company and its results are already out!

Unfortunately for both parties we seemed to have missed the short squeeze opportunity of a lifetime(for now, more on this later).

You can place the blame for that squarely in Robinhood's court.  Make no mistake about it, those unbelievable fucks cost retail BILLIONS of dollars in potential tendies.

We don't have to engage in conspiratorial thinking to consider this.  Of course, it could certainly be true that Citadel leaned on them to force them to cut off retail, but the application of Hanlon's razor ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s\_razor#:\~:text=Hanlon's%20razor%20is%20a%20principle,unlikely%20explanations%20for%20human%20behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor#:~:text=Hanlon's%20razor%20is%20a%20principle,unlikely%20explanations%20for%20human%20behavior).) makes it equally likely that the primary driver for the spigot being closed was the potential insolvency of Robinhood(who has since raised 3-4 Billion dollars from current investors).  The insolvency issue is covered nicely in Episode 19 of the All In podcast(Chamath is love, Chamath is life): [https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/e19-breaking-down-robinhoods-gamestop-decision-why/id1502871393](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/e19-breaking-down-robinhoods-gamestop-decision-why/id1502871393)

If I was a Robinhood user I would not forget this and strongly urge anyone still on that platform to pick a real broker from the list of those that didn't fuck retail on this.  You should also join one of the many class action lawsuits on this.  Even non-robinhood users should do so if you were holding GME shares or options on the critical date(1/28) as you owned an asset that was subject to market manipulation and suffered a loss. (not legal advice, not a lawyer).

As you can see from the available S3 data the 28th was also the high water mark for short interest.  After that date shorts started closing positions so a much more terrestrial amount of shares were open shorts in the following days: [https://twitter.com/biancoresearch/status/1356639453394141184](https://twitter.com/biancoresearch/status/1356639453394141184)

Some fellow retards have raised doubts about the quality of the data from both S3 and Ortex, some going so far as to say they have colluded with the likes of citadel as well.  At present this appears to be speculative at best and most importantly lacks any compelling evidence to support that conjecture.  If anyone has something more concrete on this I'd be happy to look into it.

All this leads us to the present moment: Ortex Data as of 2/2/2021

As you can see all the numbers we should care about from a short squeeze perspective are down in a big way: Cost to borrow(vig on shorts), days to cover(how long it would take to unwind current shorts), and estimated short interest(number of open shorts).  So for now at least the squeeze seems very unlikely for the near future(that being said I'm holding 2 Feb 5 $800C just incase, to hedge upside for my Feb 12 $150P's).

Another Squeeze and lessons learned?

[https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356775930857992193](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356775930857992193)

It certainly seems possible but I'm not particularly bullish on a short time frame a basis.  In order to reproduce the conditions that lead to this incredible run we'd need a number of things to fall back into place:

1. Retail would need to accumulate shares at a much lower price point: It was much easier for u/DeepFuckingValue to hold his GME than late comers because his cost basis was so low compared to those coming in at $100+ or even $50+
2. Retail would also need to be on broker platforms that have fortress balance sheets so they could absorb the swings without closing off the buying spigot
3. Short interest would need to return to the stratospheric levels pre- mid-January AND those shorts would need a lower position open price (P < \~$20) so they could be overwhelmed by the initial push
4. IV would need to come back down to earth from it's currently insane 495% level for GME, this would make options cheap enough to allow buying into the gamma ramp effect we all saw in the initial trip to the moon

In closing I would say don't feel bad about not making it to Pluto because we at least made it to Mars and stuck a WSB flag on it's surface.  We have all changed the stock market forever. We've also  announced to the shithead hedge funds of the world that there is a new sheriff in town and they need to watch their fucking backs.

Current POS:

GME Feb 12th $150P

GME Feb 5th $800C

AMC Feb 12th $10P

Assuming this actually makes it through the automod and you retards are interested I'm thinking of posting an after action report on how I dealt with this whole GME ride.  Good luck out there you degenerates.

Just wanted to give you an update on the IFF Short and gamma squeeze opportunity I brought to WSB on Monday. 

It is great news! The cost to borrow shares continues rocket upwards (44.7%), and they continue to use borrowed shares to try and keep down the price.

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/IFF

As you can see, the drop at end of day was driven by the shorts selling 15,000 shares. Which doesn't sound like alot, but it is HUGE for such a low volume stock, with low IVs.

Options are little changed:

There is a good options ladder this week (at $135 and $150), and there is a monstrous option gamma squeeze at $150 for Feb 19.

This is also a very valuable company, which will see significant growth in their price to sales multiple, now that their acquisition of DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences is complete.

Here is the Ortex data for yesterday. For some reason I am not able to upload a new screenshot, but it is little changed (just those new shares sold short). 
The current number of borrowed (short) shares is at 61.99m:
https://imgur.com/gallery/sEIUmWb

And yes, I own a position in this stock. This is not investment advice, and all that other stuff. Do your own DD, and please, tell me why I am wrong.

Here are my pros and cons for it overall (on Mobile):
Pros: 
1 - Completed merger with Dupont Nutrition and Biosciences. One of the big advantages of this merger is it allows IFF to offer full spectrum product development, with an excellent focus on Plant based nutrition. (without disclosing too much, plant based nutrition was the only segment to grow very well during the pandemic, and now tastes as good, or better than dairy based nutrition, so it is set to explode in the USA.)

2 - Consistent dividend growth. IFF tripled their dividends over 10 years. See above for my expectations for further growth in income. And looking back, they have been increasing their dividend since the 90s.

3 - IFF has traded sideways for years, all the while increasing earnings / decreasing their multiples. They are an ignored, low volatility stock.

4 - There is excessive short interest, as far as I can tell (iborrowdesk.com and Ortex). To me, that means there is good short term upside potential.

5 - ~25% of the outstanding stock is owned by the TetraPak family holding company. They are insiders in this industry, and clearly know who their customers are using to flavor the drinks going into TetraPaks.

6 - The flavor industry is technically complex, and there is very limited competition. And IFF has something like 3000 patents (serious, it is crazy complex, scientist with crazy hair level of technical complexity.)

7 - Their dividend percent is about a percent above the industry standard (~2.5% vs 1.5%).

Cons:

1 - I don't know how well the merger will work.

2 - There are alot of shares coming ""soon"", but should still trade around the same value.

We all know about short interest, possible short ladder attacks, low volume, and all that. But there is an argument I read yet: the further the price goes down, the more difficult it is to actually push it lower. 

If these funds swapping around shares is the primary driver of the collapse in price, then they will confront a prisoner's dilemma-type situation. Seeing the possibility of the largest bomb in financial history detonating, each financial firm that has gone short knows full well that others want to cut their losses, lick their wounds, and fight another day. As we know if one firm closes some of their shorts, the demand, and the price increase. But the bomb is still there looming in the background. 

The worst-case scenario for holders of GME is the steady unloading of shorts over a long period of time, where the de-loading process is less expensive than the margin interest that these firms have to pay to keep their shares. So, think the price of GME remaining steady at like $20 or $30 for months-- an acceptable loss for hedge funds. To do this, almost every short fund would have to agree to collaborate in near-perfect harmony. And, as we know, that is nearly impossible.

It's going to take a really long time for us to go back to $17-- this is just not possible in the short run. To make matters worse for the firms, the short interest increased to around 212%. The bomb has only grown more dangerous. As long as this is the case, you should hold. Months can feel like years, but if we are resilient and GME actually does decently as a company, these short positions are going to bleed out. I just don't see how unwinding these positions is probable when a single closed position could set off the bomb. 

But then again, I don't know how to read. And, yes I'd like a large soda with that.

With the western world wanting Chinese companies (Huawei, ZTE) out due to national security concerns, they are set up as one of two major players to scoop up a large portion of the market share in the US and Europe as the 5G rollout snowballs harder and harder in the coming years. Plus, they have over 3000 patents that basically fortify their position in this regard.


**(2)** They have recently replaced their CEO with a certified asskicker named Pekka Lundmark who has a consistent record of happy shareholders and success within global business-to-business technology companies. The man even worked for Nokia back in their heyday before leaving to go chalk up some more wins, and now he is back to make Nokia a global powerhouse once more.


**(3)** Everyone complaining about the size of float is a 🌈🐻 of the same variety that said that GME would never stay above $12 a couple months ago. Just last week NOK spiked hard on volume before getting kicked in the nuts as a collateral damage from brokerages neutering GME and co. For now the crayon munchers of the trading world brainlessly associate NOK with the squeeze plays because they saw it and WSB in the same sentence, but once that fog clears and the collective room temperature IQ of the broader market finally processes that NOK is actually a solid play, interest will drive volume into a cascading repeat of what started to happen last week.


**(4)** Nokia is currently discounted when measured up against pretty much any comparable company on a P/E basis. This is likely due to pessimism surrounding recent trends in their financials, but that is what happens when you make temporary cuts to hone your business into a laser-focused money printer for the singular purpose of domination in the wireless infrastructure sector. The boomer bean-counters don't seem to understand that plowing money into R&D and restructuring a business into a lean, mean, 5G machine = long term growth, which this market has shown itself to reward generously and this will likely begin to price in sooner rather than later. (Hence why now is the time to take the boomers' shares from them at boomer prices and get your one-way ticket to the moon before the rest of the glue eaters realize what is happening and buy at the top as they so like to do).

**Bonus Point:** Nokia is literally putting 4G on the moon. If this isn't a sign for you I don't know what is. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I know I may get downvoted for this... but at this point honestly **fuck the squeeze.**

This could be a lifelong hold into some serious generational wealth. I'm in it for the qualitative now.

**For all you retards who can’t read and are just 💎🙌 🦍🍌... 🧠= 💎🙌∞**

Look at what’s happened today alone...

Matt Francis, new GameStop Chief Tech Officer formerly from AWS, lead engineer. Think about that for sec... The guy who is responsible for Amazon's web services. Amazon IS fucking web services, well, it's also fulfilment of course. This is still retail we’re talking about.

Josh Krueger, new GameStop VP of Fulfillment formerly from Amazon, Walmart, QVC. I shouldn't need to tell you why this is a big move. Looks like the guy has literally been growing in the same exact fucking direction as the industry. Next in line for him, Gamestop

Kelli **MF** Durkin, new GameStop Sr VP of Customer Care, previously from CHEWY. Everything people love about Chewy that made it such a lovable brand comes from their customer service dpt. They'll leave the UXUI up to Matt and his team while Kelli’s team keeps on making the customer’s come back to buy more. Don’t underestimate the power of good customer service. I’ve straight up switched ISP’s because of this.

Now, combine this dream team, with the (un)expected possibility of Ryan Cohen becoming CEO. This really is some Avengers End Game shit.

This fucking super team could really turn GameStop into the one-stop-game-shop everything gaming related. I’m talking build-a-pc centers with the next-gen GPU’s/CPUs hitting exclusively GME first (re: fulfillment), online streaming community (aka Twitch/Amazon), sharing revenue on cloud-based game streaming platforms (like MSFT GamePass), combined with a dedication to their customer. **That’s fucking YOU, YOU RETARD!**

Okay, now for a very light amount of quantitative speculation. Imagine holding your current amount of shares, the stock eventually hits $400 and it splits 8:1. Now, with 8x more shares you slowly climb up to $1000. Maybe it splits again along the way, who fucking knows, you do the math. Yeah it’s that same hypothetical math you’ve been doing the past week only... 1x your current share amount. Kinda makes you want to get more shares.

Obligatory, I am most certainly a retard, so this is not advice so please don’t listen to me. Only a fool on a rant."|2021-02-03 17:05:16.030449|../output/raw/2021/02/03/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170519.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'AWS', 'IS', 'VP', 'QVC', 'I', 'VP', 'CHEWY', 'UXUI', 'CEO', 'GME', 'MSFT', 'YOU', 'YOU', 'ETARD', 'I']|['GME', 'MSFT']

56% of asset flows into global markets come from passive vehicles like ETF’s and buy and hold strategies with minimal turnover. With increased passive flows into the market, this means that by finding upcoming additions to ETF’s and these strategies, you can front run ETF additions and reap the gains that come with that.

My positions:

**Full DD**:

My fellow degens, it has been quite some time since my last DD posts: XME ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jngrc7/xme\_2021\_the\_diamond\_in\_the\_rough/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jngrc7/xme_2021_the_diamond_in_the_rough/) ), and APPS ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i4sxez/digital\_turbine\_apps\_rise\_of\_the\_fuckery/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i4sxez/digital_turbine_apps_rise_of_the_fuckery/) )

And for an update on how those went, XME is at $33 and some change, and APPS is pushing $64. Both exceedingly met my minimum targets.

But back to what this post is really all about. Today I am here to bring to light my background in finance and 2 additional stock picks for this year and into 2022 so you fucks can reap the tendies from the unintended inefficiencies our great investment industry has brought about. So without further or do:

Since 2000 the investment management industry has heavily pushed for passive investing from managers like BlackRock and Vanguard, in order to deal with the double-edged blade of underwhelming performance and high fees. Several studies have been made over the years that found that the investor’s #1 enemy was themselves, with Fidelity finding that the average investor return the past 20 years being roughly 2.5%, (primarily because investors would jump in and out of investments during moments of panic (08 for example). While the S&P rose 7.5% annualized during the same time period.

However, the utter destruction of value in 08, led to a massive transition to passive investment vehicles to “diversify risk exposures” and a further push towards a buy and hold mentality.

When you look back at the data during these periods, investors who jumped out at or near the bottom of 08, didn’t recover until after 2012, where investors who held the whole time recovered by 2010. Today, we have roughly 56% of assets flows into the market entering from these passive vehicles, which is up from 23% back in 2007. \*

\*below is a link covering how passive funds have now exceeded the actively managed funds in the market. Further research on this can be found in CFAI's research database.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-11/passive-u-s-equity-funds-eclipse-active-in-epic-industry-shift?sref=vT8b8AvT](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-11/passive-u-s-equity-funds-eclipse-active-in-epic-industry-shift?sref=vT8b8AvT)

\*for clarification on what I mean by passive flows, these are ETFs, index, or strategy that purpose is to track a basket of stocks or securities with minimal turnover. Additionally, these include assets held in retirement accounts, brokerage accounts, pensions, and other asset manager portfolios.

Because of this massive increase in passive flows, this ironically brings some new trading opportunities and risks to the individual/institutional investor that was not immediately present:

1. This massive indexation of assets increases correlations among securities to a degree in which you need machine learning techniques to fully understand relationships
2. Illiquidity risk: the buy and hold strategy also depletes the available supply of stocks in the market. As we saw with GME, at least 45% of the total supply was held by 10 different asset managers in their ETF portfolios, Thus reducing the amount of stock available to borrow and increasing the probability of these short squeeze situations. The downside to this is that should everyone panic or have a need for cash, you get violent downward moves like we had last March due to supply being flooded into the market.
3. Once you understand the metrics used to find new additions to these portfolio strategies, one can front-run additions to passive strategies, causing massive gains.

Point 3 is where I really want to hit on. With all the data available to us, finding opportunities to front-run passive funds because much easier. As we have seen with Cathy Wood and Ark Investment Management, she is a pop star in finance now. People flock to her stock picks just because of the calls she made… But the best part? Other Investment managers now want a piece of that action.

So this is where I bring you to my stock picks: NNDM and PSTG

These are two sub-$30 stocks in her Ark fund ETF portfolios that are being added to BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity, and Jp Morgan’s upcoming innovation funds. These funds mimic and add leverage to the ARK funds such as JPM’s 3x ARKK fund, or hold the same/similar holdings.

NNDM is an Israeli tech company and has been on a rampage since October when ARK started adding it to their portfolios. Usually, ARK continues adding to their portfolios over a 1-3y timeline and holds for a minimum of 3 years. This sucker could easily continue to pop up as more positions are added.

**PSTG** is another addition ARK has been making in their funds, tech company based near Silicon Valley, delivers data storage, encryption, and protection solutions in block-storage. Given the rise to this specialized form of data management, this a solid long-term bet on the transition of the tech industry.

Both of these stocks have solid futures because of the innovation tilts they have. But in the mean-time, thanks to the low price and cheap call options on these stocks. This is definitely something to take advantage of before they begin to get expensive.

If you followed my previous posts, you know I like taking a relatively lower risk, high return bets with minimal upfront output. So my plays are as follows:

**PSTG**: target 3months $40-$45, year end- $75

Bought 50 May calls @$30

Sold 25 may put spreads @ $25/$20

Net credit: $1,735

Max Loss: 8k

Max Gain: unlimited

Risks: Due to the credit spread, this locks up a significant margin and as such, if the stock falls between the spread by expiration, you will need to coffer up the difference. So even though you are being paid 1.7k for making this play, you will be taking significant risks should it fall between the spread and you are on margin. Good to have cash handy should you decide to do a trade like this. I recommend buying puts to hedge out the possibility of a market dump, this will dilute your net credit received, but you have protection.

**NNDM**: Target -3months: $50, year end $60

Bought 30 May calls @$20

Sold 75 May put spreads @ $17.5/$12.5

Bought 50 march puts @$10

Net Credit: $7k

Max Loss: Occurs between $10 – $12.5: 24k

Max gain: unlimited.

Risks: Again because there is a spread, we do have the same margin lock-up provision. However, adding the puts below $10 provides some insurance should we have a market dump. The goal here is to offset the costs of the spread with there being a market dump and thus, be neutral at the end.

These trades are primarily to take advantage of the additions that investment managers will be making later this year. This will passively push prices upwards on a quarterly basis. With March on the way, its a solid time to get in prior to the quarterly addition

So degens, here are two trades for you for the year, and more yet to come. Keep hedged and get them tendies. If them “professional investors” wanna play chess, let’s match them.

Side note: I'll update in quarterly intervals. My time horizons are generally 3 months long  in order to fully take advantage of how investment managers reallocate their funds."|2021-02-03 17:05:16.030449|../output/raw/2021/02/03/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170519.csv|DueDiligence|['PSTG']|[]|['ETF', 'DD', 'XME', 'APPS', 'XME', 'APPS', 'I', 'P', 'I', 'GME', 'ETF', 'I', 'I', 'NNDM', 'PSTG', 'ETF', 'ARK', 'ARKK', 'NNDM', 'ARK', 'ARK', 'ARK', 'I', 'I']|['GME']

[…] These outsiders saw the giant lie at the heart of the economy, and they saw it by doing something the rest of the suckers never thought to do: They looked”. (Big Short)
  
I have seen many good quality DD about Corsair. We all know it’s a great business.
  
What I want to focus on is the financials. More specifically: We already know Q4 results and nobody is talking about it! Why? Because nobody looked!!!
  
Corsair recently posted a prospectus related to the sale of 7.5M shares by some insiders (totally normal as it’s mostly the private equity owner – EagleTree - selling a small bit and passing from 78.32% to 68.55% ownership - they sold 7,135,000 out of the 7,500,000 sold… It’s totally fair for the PE owner to cash out a bit).
  
Here’s the prospectus (dated 21st of January 2021): https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33

1) Now, check out page 9 of the document
  
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect:
  
• Net revenue to be between approximately $1,700 million and $1,701 million
  
• Net income to be between approximately $101 million and $103 million
  
• Adjusted EBITDA to be between approximately $211 and $213 million
  
Yes, we already know they have beaten their own updated estimates…
  
In fact, the company initially estimated the following (from Q3 release https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d)
  
For the full year 2020, we currently expect:
  
• Net revenue to be in the range of $1,616 million to $1,631 million.
  
• Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $178 million to $184 million.
  
• Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $187 million to $193 million.Then, they updated the guidance on November 30th 2020 (https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook):
  
For the full year 2020, we currently expect:
  
• Net revenue to be in the range of $1,651 million to $1,666 million.
• Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $186 million to $192 million.
• Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $194 million to $200 million.
  
So they have beaten their own initial and revisited estimates. Great!! Really great!!
  
2) But that’s not all we can easily infer from the Prospectus dated January 21, 2021 (Again… we just need to look).
  
As they mention on the Q3 report, “as of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $370.1 million”.In the more recent prospectus (page 10):
  
In addition to the foregoing, as of December 31, 2020, we expect to have approximately $133 million in cash and restricted cash and we expect to have net debt of approximately $194 million following the repayment of $50.0 million in existing debt with cash on hand during the quarter ended December 31, 2020.
  
This means that they have reduced net debt from $250M ($370 - $120 of cash) to $194M, which implies $56M of free cash flow generated during the quarter. As a reminder, they generated around 21M FCF in q3 2020 and 94M in the first 9 months of 2020. So this implies around 150M FCF in 2020 (as a reference in the first 9 months of 2019, they had negative FCF of about 6M).
  
(check cash flow statement at page 14 on the Q3 report here https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d)
  
At $39, Corsair has a 3.5Bn market cap (91.92M of shares outstanding).
  
This is a very respectable cash flow yield of 4.2%. I’d be expecting a much lower yield from a company growing as fast as Corsair is (60.7% growth year-over-year in Q3 and, assuming sales of 554M for Q4 vs 327M for Q4 2019, a growth of 69.4% in Q4).Now, you must be thinking: but the smart money already knows this! They have accounted for it!
  
I used to be like you… I used to think the market was efficient and that big funds and banks were always looking carefully at things!
  
No f*** way!!!
  
Take a look at Goldman Sachs’ research from February 1st 2021 (yes, after the prospectus was published).
  
Someone shared it on reddit

They still base themselves on the updated guidance of November 30th 2020. No mention whatsoever of the much more recently updated “guidance” (more than a guidance, it’s actually the results given how close the ranges are…)
  
TLDR: Corsair 🚀🚀🚀

I have been posting on this sub for over 3 years back when we were at only a couple hundred thousand. This is my first DD write up and I’m a little retarded so please go easy on me. 

For everyone who doesn’t want to read a wall of text there’s a **TL:DR** at the bottom.

**Technical Setup:**

Canoo has completed its SPAC merger and ticker change a little over a month ago going from HCAC to GOEV. Ever since the combination it has been piled into by shorts. The short position has grown exponentially from 99k shares to over 10 million as of the last update by NASDAQ. I subscribe to S3 Capital’s retail short algorithm which gives a more accurate current estimate of ~11 million shares short. New available shorts are nearly nonexistent and borrow rates are sky rocketing. If you haven’t been living under a rock the past couple of weeks you already know how well short squeezes can play out. 

[S3 short Info](https://imgur.com/RPVpzbu)

[NASDAQ Short Info](https://imgur.com/LrjJJCD)

[Share Borrow & Fees](https://imgur.com/esZFBfL)

**Fundamental Setup:**

GOEV has a ton of positive catalyst the shorts are overlooking and I believe this will lead to large losses on their side. For one, the EV revolution is here to stay as you can tell from the new administration. Biden plans to electrify the whole federal fleet (estimated 650k vehicles). GOEV  has the perfect mid sized commercial B2B purpose built vehicle which fits the build of many government vehicles. The Canoo purpose built vehicle can replace for example USPS mail trucks.

[MPDV Purpose Built Vehicle](https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/) 

Canoo’s leadership are veterans in the automotive industry which is hard to say for some of the other SPAC *cough * NKLA. Canoo's co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was CTO at EV carmaker Faraday Future and more importantly has over 30 years of management experience at BMW. He worked to reimagine the MINI brand, develop the company's first SUV, and the iProject (BMW i8 & i3). They also poached talent from Tesla; Sohel Merchant (vehicle architecture) Christoph Kuttner (vehicle trim), and Alexi Charbonneau (proprietary EV skateboard tech) just to name a few. 

The real value here is their proprietary B2B skateboard platform for EVs. Allowing for any automaker to design and build their perfect sedan and just clip on to an already existing powertrain. Now AAPL is most likely going to sign an EV production contract with Hyundai/KIA (expected as soon as Feb 17th) confirmed last night by the  3.6 Billion investment. GOEV is already providing their platform to Hyundai/KIA. GOEV has already been validated by AAPL as in AAPL wanted to buy them out in 2020 so clearly they like their tech. And if you think that’s not enough to sell you on this theory then listen to this: In 2015, Apple almost used the BMW i3 as the basis for its Apple Car… the two founders of Canoo were the top guys on the iProject. It doesn’t take a genius to connect these dots.

(obligatory fuck you Melvin, fuck you Shittron)

Here's my DD on Cassava Sciences, a biopharmaceutical company developing Sumifilam, a new Alzheimers drug.

**TLDR: CASSAVA Sciences got 68% of its operating costs paid in grants by the NIH in order to fund a groundbreaking Alzheimer's drug that's about to get fast-tracked to market to treat all of our dementia-riddled grandparents. SAVA gets a $286 price target assuming phase 3 success and my autistic math says that gives a $186 current fair value.**

A few days ago, this article got published on Seeking Alpha:

>**4 Reasons Cassava Sciences Could Be The Best-Performing Stock Of 2021**

There’s a lot of good info in this that we don’t have time to get into but I’ll focus in on one key point the author makes:

>**Simufilam is a Shoo-In for Breakthrough Therapy Designation**

Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) means it will be accelerated through phase 3 trials to market *40% faster* than non breakthrough drugs.

If Simufilam gets BTD, this is what will happen to the stock price:

[Immunomedics gets BTD on Trodelvy in 2\/5\/16](https://preview.redd.it/exy4vyadtaf61.png?width=1872&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d70aa788c46f54f29bd51d4027c4eb22fb87f99)

Let’s zoom out a little bit:

[🚀Immunomedics 🚀Acquired 🚀In 🚀$21B 🚀 Deal ](https://preview.redd.it/mplmcot7taf61.png?width=1840&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ef980e1c472c0725134d42201fdc9f7661afd93)

***What are some good indicators Sumifilam will get Breakthrough Therapy Designation?***

According to the FDA:

>A Breakthrough Therapy is a drug:  
>  
>intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and  
>  
>preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development

Sumifilam satisfies both of these requirements and you can bet your autistic ass that our octogenarian politicians are pushing for this type of groundbreaking Alzheimer drug research to receive virtually unlimited funding and a regulatory pass.

Cassava Sciences received government research grants totaled $1.8 million in 2017, $3.0 million in 2018, $4.7 million in 2019, and $3.4 million the first three quarters of 2020. ***$3.4 million.*** That means that the US government paid for **68%** of the operating costs of this company 2020. This is even more indication that Sumifilam will get the green light from the FDA when it comes to BTD.

***What's a reasonable price target on SAVA?***

A quick google search reveals 60-70% success rate on phase 3 trials. If we assume the author of this article is correct about his **$286** price target after successful phase 3 trial, we have to give SAVA a **$186** target based on EV. (Disclaimer: I am in no way qualified to give anything a price target)

If you have any more questions please read the fucking article, it's too long for me to finish.

$CNC is one of the largest ACA and public health player and also is the first major public health on the ER Calendar for next Tuesday. Beta is 1.08 and marketwatch low target is 16% higher that todays price.

The dip this month is being attributed to Q4 covid utilization and unfavorable vaccine distribution, but:

 (1) here is going to be an ACA SEP from feb15 through early summer

(2) Biden admin increased subsidies on silver ACA plans to the point where many members are going to have zero premiums which should not only increase enrollment during the SEP but also decrease attrition rates throughout the year

(3) Economic downturns boost medicaid enrollment

Entertainment purposes only.   
I work in the film & tv industry in Hollywood. I was bearish on AMC for 2021 because of the pandemic. Our industry pretty much shut down and our local productions, while still going on, are pricey due to the many restrictions and guidelines set forth by our state. 

But recent events with GME made me take a deep dive into the numbers, and well, AMC actually looks pretty good. I nearly forgot that studios like Paramount, Universal, Disney, etc. are bagholding their slate of tentpole movies (movies with budgets well over 200-million) because it doesn't make any sense to stream them.

**Quick Facts:**  
1) AMC received a fresh infusion of cash through the stonks.   
2) And this was after AMC received loans in the north of 100-million.  
**And here's the banger:**  
3) AMC has 2-years worth of tentpole movies from all the major studios waiting for release. This includes Tenet (projected 1.5-billion), Mulan, Wonder Woman, Top Gun 2, Fast and the Furious, Bond, Pixar's Soul, Space Jam and many many more.  A typical year might have three of these. 

This is bad for the studies because their ""great"" movies now have to compete for market share in a saturated market, but for AMC, it's a great problem to have. It's like having 2 Christmas's in one day. 

**Pent-Up Demand:**  
Box office ticket sales, pre-pandemic, have been around 10-11-billion dollars per year. AMC has the dominant market share and had been generating about 5 to 5.5-billion in revenue (from ticket sales and concessions). 

When Japan re-opened their theaters, Demon Slayer became the number one grossing movie of all time. Pundits believed that the Japanese would've probably watched anything that was released at that point due to pent-up demand. 

If the pent-up demand hypothesis is true, then late 2021 might have the biggest, most profitable quarter ever for AMC, and 2022 will be even bigger. Forward guidance reported in any 2021 quarter's earnings will foster great optimism, and due to secular factors and the fed's push for lower interest rates, we might see some of the best numbers 

**Another possibility:**  
If Japan cancels the Olympics (likely), that opens up another 2-3-month window of time for studios to schedule their releases. For example, instead of Wonder Woman competing for August's 1-billion market share with Pixar's Soul, Soul could release in August, and Wonder Woman could release in October, etc. This means more efficient releases and more dinero for AMC. 

TL;DR - Pent-up demand, likely near-term re-opening due to vaccines, the fact that major film studios are bag-holding tentpole movies and will do whatever it takes to release them to the market when AMC still has the lead market share of theatrical ticket sales makes me MEGA bullish on AMC."|2021-02-03 17:05:16.030449|../output/raw/2021/02/03/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170519.csv|DueDiligence|['AMC', 'DD']|['AMC']|['I', 'I', 'AMC', 'GME', 'AMC', 'I', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'A', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'DR', 'AMC', 'MEGA', 'AMC']|['AMC', 'GME', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC']

💎👐💎👐💎👐💎👐💎👐💎

Okay so I personally think that that GME is going to trade relatively sideways until we see another catalyst. The new technology executive announcement is definitely very positive, but doesn’t have the same spark as an Elon tweet.

I think, as many of my fellow bag holders are all hoping, that Ryan Cohen exercising his right to purchase 7% of GME will provide the spark we need to get back on track to the 400/500 and beyond range.

So, Ryan’s a smart guy. I think he recognizes where this company can go and the massive gaming and e sports industry that is only on the rise - it’s obvious there is strong pricing support at the $90 range.

If $90 is the new floor, which I believe it is, and Ryan Cohen may as well, what is the probability of him exercising this right? 

I’d say we have a 50/50 chance that he announces the purchase of these shares this week. I think GameStop is going to piggyback off of their latest executive hire announcement into this, and fully come out as a online/e-commerce transitioning company.

I think that their competitor, EA sports, is going to amplify this need with their latest results . As Dow Jones newswire says today:

“The game publishing giant reported late Tuesday a 19% jump in net bookings for the December quarter, driven by digital sales and its live services. The company noted that 62% of its new game sales for the quarter were digital, compared to 49% in last year's holiday period. 

Digital game sales create two problems for GameStop. One, they generally don't move through GameStop stores, with the exception of those driven by cards that the retailer sells. “

TLDR: 50% chance that GME has been quietly lurking and just waiting for the right time to announce with Ryan Cohen. They wanted to wait for all you paper handed b*tches to bounce.

First, let's look at the the upgrades in the last month. **Jefferies upgraded $ELY's price target from $30 to $40 with upside of $50**; Stephens upgraded their price target from $25 to $32; and today B. Riley upgraded from $30 to $33. I am in possession of the analyst briefs from Jefferies and Stephens that are ultra-bullish. Although I cannot redistribute the briefs, **please watch** [**this video**](https://players.brightcove.net/4090876629001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6227392033001) **from Jefferies** to get an idea.**🚀**

Second, we need to talk about volume. Since I left, the volume has started to fade a little likely because MMs see this as a prime stock to short because of the low volume. **Let's show them who the fuck is boss and buy up the shares to make this thing fly**. Even if we can't come in and bump the volume up, there are two catalysts that surely will: 1. earnings at some point in the next two weeks, and 2. the special stockholder meeting on March 3, 2021 that was disclosed in this [SEC filing](https://flashalert.me/?symbol=ELY&source=SEC&referer=https://stocktwits.com/&url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/837465/000119312521019310/d54680ds4a.htm&s3=ELY/2021-01-27/17-12-32_000000/S-4/A/37aec9cfee04158dd314f8fd84c1e178/d54680ds4a.htm). **🚀**

Let's keep our little grassroots movement moving! If you have any questions look through my previous posts linked below or send me a message. I appreciate all of you so damn much for following me, and **if we hit $35 by February 18, 2021, I will donate $5,000 to the Autistic Self Advocacy Network.**

**TLDR: $ELY to the moon 🚀🌙**

Edit 1: The end of day fade happens every time. Hold the line to scare the MMs out.

Edit 2: Upon further education by u/aerodynamic_lobster and u/Aniquilar the potential recipient of the $5,000 donation will go to Autistic Self Advocacy Network instead of Autism Speaks.

-Friday and Sunday futures buyers bumped up the price forcing dealers to increase premium for paper silver 

- Monday everyone and their mother bought inflated premium calls

-Silver inventories sold out meanwhile the bankers have enough silver inventory to cover and hedge since they have earlier deliveries at lower spot prices from previous contracts.

This is for all you guys who bought GME at 300+ expecting it to go to 3k two hours later. Yes, I know you’re hurt because GME isn’t doing what you want it to do right now, believe me I know how that feels. But let me enlighten you and show you the way. There is actually more than GME and AMC to this market so hold tight and invest now.
APT are currently sitting at about $15 per share, but will be much higher in the coming weeks due to current Covid-19 developments.

**The company**

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/APT?ltr=1

Alpha Pro Tech develops, manufactures and markets disposable protective apparel and building materials in the U.S. as well as internationally. The two segments are Building Supply and Disposable Protective Apparel. The Building Supply segment includes building products such as house wrap and synthetic roof underlayment, as well as other woven materials.

The Disposable Protective Apparel segment includes disposable protective apparel (including shoe covers, caps, coveralls, robes, gowns, and lab coats), face masks, and face shields. Specifically, N-95 respirators are manufactured in the United States. Alpha Pro Tech has developed very strongly in 2020 due to the extremely high demand for N-95 respirators to protect against COVID-19. 

Face masks will have a very different position under President Biden than under Trump, as they are now mandatory to wear in many places.
On his first full day in office, President Biden announced a dozen directives so-called ""executive orders,"" to combat the coronavirus pandemic. These include N95 masks, laboratory equipment, isolation gowns, gloves, swabs, syringes, raw materials for vaccines, and other items. Products such as the U.S.-made N95 masks have priority!

The stock rose from $5 to $25 at the Corona breakout. Then followed the decline to about 11$ (Currently about 15$). Alpha Pro Tech is sitting on cash, has no debt and has started a US$7 million share buyback program.  The market capitalization is 186 million US$. 

**But no short squeeeeeze?**

According to https://www.highshortinterest.com/ the company has a short interest of 24% right now. So, no this is not the next GME, but probably nothing ever will be.
As I think the fundamentals look solid on this one I expect we might see a x5 on APT over the next months

TLDR: Buy APT"|2021-02-03 17:05:16.030449|../output/raw/2021/02/03/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170520.csv|DueDiligence|['APT', 'DD']|[]|['GME', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'AMC', 'APT', 'APT', 'U', 'S', 'U', 'S', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'APT']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'GME']

I'm still holding some GME, but not sure how that'll work out.

WB is like the Chinese version of twitter. It has a price:sales of 6.9 compared to twitter's 12.7 so it's already undervalued there compared to twitter.  Over the past 5 years, its sales has increased 40% annually compared to Twitter's 20% annually. It's earnings has been growing as well at a rate of 50% annually in 5 years.  It has more active users than twitter at 445 millions active monthly users compared to 330 millions for twitter. China has a population of 1.4 billions so it has room to grow.  China's economy is on the up and up with more and more people getting online. So, WB is a pretty decent growth stock with long term holding potential.

&#x200B;

Interestingly, WB has a very high short interest % of 66% last reported to finviz. Not as crazy as GME was, but pretty high none the less. I believe this has drove the price down from its peak of 140s to 40s currently. This could make it a potential target for a mini short squeeze. And if not, like I said, I think its a good long term holding.

&#x200B;

I'm not a financial advisor so don't listen to my retarded rant.

Yesterday Chuck Schumer went public and said that getting read of the federal prohibition of Marijuana is a top priority this year. Since that comment almost all marijuana stocks/ETFs have MOONED. This is just the beginning. 

Imagine what till happen when this is talked about more let alone goes up for an actual vote. That is why NOW is the time to get in. Before more comments are made, legislation is written and votes are held. Even better is this year it is virtually a sure thing, as Democrats have control both the house, presidency, and the senate. Kamela Harris (our Vice President) was last years lead sponsor of the bill to legalize marijuana until it was shot down by the republican Senate. Surely she will pull her puppet strings on Joe if she needs to. 

A few ETFs I like that are relatively cheap right now: 

•MJ- exclusively US-based marijuana holdings 
•MSOS- exclusively US-based marijuana holdings 
•YOLO-70% US-based marijuana holdings and an amazing fucking ticket symbol

A few individual stocks:
•IIPR- a US-based cannabis REIT that Is ALREADY profitable (something rarely seen in the cannabis field 
•Canopy growth
•Scott’s Miracle grow

Investing in these will provide you exposure to all aspects of the marijuana industry in the US (production, cultivation, real estate, medicinal, recreational)


TLDR; Buy marijuana stocks now before legislation is drafted and passed. Call Grammy ask for her Christmas money that she gives you early. When she asks why say you created a fortune-500 rocket ship company and that you will be going to the moon in 6 months.

That's the volume for GME extracted from FINRA. **What is short exempt volume you might be wondering?** Do not worry my fellow retard, I got you: A special trading situation where a **short sale** is allowed on a **minustick**. The owners of a convertible trading at parity can sell the equivalent amount of common short on a minus tick.

""OkAy, bUt wHAt's A MinUstTick?"" A minus tick occurs when a security sells at a price less than the preceding sale. Yes, 400.000 was the number for yesterday.

Because panicked short selling can quickly send the price of a stock down, the SEC implemented the short sale exempt rule, commonly called the uptick rule. The uptick rule states that investors can only short a stock when the price is rising. Look at the numbers since 1/28. They keep shorting it, and I don't believe the interest is lower than a week ago.

Look at the volume and compare it with the shorts and make your own conclusions. This is far from over.

About the 226% short interest people have been talking about, that's outdated so let's not make any conclusions based on that until next Tuesday 2/9.

Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀🚀 (yes it’s the fucking name as you know)

Here are some cool bullet points, I don’t have pictures for those who can’t read. :(

Institutional ownership: ~95% (still near IPO price, they won’t sell anytime soon)

RKT has been consolidating for months with a fuck ton of long term investors.

ANECDOTE! I work in the industry and while anyone who does mortgages is up, market share is consistently eaten by the fucking whale that RKT is. Young people people do everything on the internet, and RKT is and has been in the drivers seat with major banks YEARS behind.

SPECULATION! RKT is forming a major partnership and will announce early this year. CEO Jay Farner confirmed this with Jim Cramer late last year. Now, who will the partner be? 

Rumor is that this person is Warren Buffet. He was granted an exemption not to disclose his position with the SEC last quarter as he seeks to build a larger position. He slashed his bank stocks last year, but loves banking/insurance businesses. He has a real estate behemoth and it would make total sense for them and RKT to partner.

 Also, Blackrock has acquired a 7% stake announced yesterday. 

Also, lockup expired yesterday...no one is fucking selling or has sold!

FuNdAmEnTals: P/E ratio is fucking 3.
Best retention rate in the industry (duh), minimal risk in a housing decline as they don’t hold their mortgages, they sell them to Fannie/Freddie (backed by the Government).

Sure maybe not a “tech valuation” but this should be a triple digit stock, if not this year then in the next few. If buffet does get in then this will be $100 pretty quickly.

Looking forward: this company is expected to blow out earnings this month as they continue to gain market share (as they are at least 5 years ahead of major competition), plus they have 2 super bowl ads this weekend.

If you are looking to be a ground floor person and not a chaser this is your opportunity.

TLDR: I buy $RKT, you should buy $RKT, make some tendies, and maybe you’ll get a blowjob or two from your wife or husband for being smart.

* **Big Pharma** dropping $7.2B on GW Pharma (They were first to get FDA approval of their CBD drug for seizures) means that big money is shifting into cannabis & CBD plays 🚀
* Democrats have the House, Senate and Presidency as many believe its the US's turn for **legalization** like what we saw in Canada (think of the Green rush of 2017-2018) 🚀🚀
* Rumours on **FDA** further clarifying their rules around CBD and cannabis products in legal states (this would send these stocks flying imo if regulations are loosened or further clarified) 🚀🚀🚀
* Opens up **exporting** to the world for many of these companies if federally cannabis is finally removed as schedule 1 drug 🚀🚀🚀🚀

I made some really good money off of Canadian cannabis companies and I think it will be Nothing in comparison to when the worlds largest economy federally states its open for business

The key thing we don't know right now is what the **real** short interest is sitting at for GME.

But let's give them the benefit of the doubt and say that the S3 numbers are right. The VW squeeze happened with less than half of the current SI GME has. For this squeeze to happen we need big players to start covering.

The SEC (though they do nothing most of the time) is *supposed to* force any HF shorting GME to cover, if we can continue to keep GME on this list for the next two days:

[https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities) (See the other posts recently about this SHO list).

And if they are still there, for 13 consecutive days, and the SEC doesn't do shit (not surprising) we will have to file thousands of complaints to them, call congressmen and senators, etc. to make sure the government steps in and forces them to cover.

Only then can we strap in and enjoy the ride 🚀🚀🚀🚀

**TLDR:**

Either the SEC will do their job and if GME keeps trading anywhere near its current price in two days big players will be forced to cover and the squeeze will (must) happen. Or we complain to the SEC to try and make them enforce their own regulation. ([https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm))

Edit: The only thing we must take into account is that the HFs have probably already seen this coming. This means they might have tried every way possible to get out of it... I'm just not sure how, yet. See this post covering this exact issue but 28 days ago...

Do you own research and due diligence. Invest at your own risk. You may lose all your capital. Don't follow my advice.

First, you can see from my post history I've been critical of the GME investment thesis, so I'm not trying to shill it. I have no GME position.

There are a couple of things not mentioned yet in the GME posts:

1. The shorts have not covered yet. Why? Because the majority of the shorts were shorting the stock when it was in the low double-digits. There's no way they would have covered at >$100 unless forced (see Melvin). [Highshortinterest.com](https://Highshortinterest.com) shows GME short interest at 121.07% today.
2. A few shorts may have exited, but just a marginal %, which have been replaced by new shorts at a high entry price. The investment thesis hasn't changed so your approach should not change.
3. Official short interest stats are coming out in a few days (9th feb I think) when we will know what the SI was on 31st Jan. This is super important.
4. Since, as I speculate, the shorts haven't been able to meaningfully cover, the official stats will show that short interest is still way over 100%. This will trigger another massive squeeze.
5. Shorts have up to the 9th feb to cover before a second squeeze. Therefore they will try desperately to drive the price down between now and the 9th. This is critical to understand. I wouldn't be surprised if the stock rallies on the 8th as they try to exit frantically. I mean, what do you think will happen if the world finds out on 2/9 that the short interest is still >100%?
6. MMs buy shares when you buy calls because they always hedge. The same happens when you sell puts. If you like the share and would buy it at $10 you can sell puts at that strike price. You will get a small premium and if the share hits $10 you will have to pay to receive 100 shares at $10 each.  Note: Beware of margin impact if you sell options. Don't find yourself cornered and forced to cover because it can be very expensive. This is strictly for those that have a lot of money in their accounts and don't need/use margin.

Disclaimer: none of the above is investment advice. Do you own research and due diligence. Invest at your own risk. You may lose all your capital. Don't follow my advice.

If I have got something wrong please correct me.

&#x200B;

EDIT: for those that keep mentioned the shorts entering at $500. You need to remember that the supply of shortable shares in the last two weeks has been minimal to 0. Therefore there can't be many 'new shorts' who got in the last few days. This means that most of the original shorts (who shorted at low prices) are still trapped in. Those who entered recently at high levels don't matter much in the overall % shorted. They are a small amount."|2021-02-03 17:05:16.030449|../output/raw/2021/02/03/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170519.csv|DueDiligence|['GME']|['GME']|['GME', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'A', 'I', 'SI', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

I know everything is about $GME at the moment, but this has to do with $GME too. If Melvin Capital has to close its doors, the market will likely see a major pullback due to them reducing long positions etc.  
Have a read below:

* **February is statistically the 2nd worst month in the year**  
Statistically, February is the second worst month for stocks, right after September. Citing historical data dating back to 1928, stocks see an average decline of 0.11% in February, a median return of just 0.27%, and are positive only 52.7% of the time. This indicates that the average sell-off is greater than a market rally, as market gain is slightly more likely. Additionally, the current put/call ratio is signaling a sense of complacency among investors, ""[a sign that is typically seen near market tops](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-correction-risk-increasing-resistance-levels-bofa-2021-1-1030000521)"", so Bank of America. CFRA's Sam Stovall also notes, that t[he negative trend is more pronounced during a president’s first term in office.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/major-correction-will-surprise-market-speculators-cfras-sam-stovall.html)
* **Fundamentals become increasingly disconnected from price**  
The democratization of stocks has lead many niche stocks higher, giving them a rich valuation in comparison to the broader marker. Overall prices seem more disconnected from Earnings across the board. While forward looking P/E has [declined from a high of 39.95 in Q4 '20 to 25.35 for Q4 '21](https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_pe_ratio_forward_estimate#:~:text=S%26P%20500%20P%2FE%20Ratio%20Forward%20Estimate%20is%20at%20a,36.55%25%20from%20one%20year%20ago.) for the S&P 500, time weighted average of consensus estimates of P/E is still close to ATH, according to [Yardeni Research](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/stockmktperatio.pdf). This is mostly attributed to crazy valuations in the Large Cap sector.
* **Stocks decline on earnings beat**  
Companies that beat earnings and revenue expectations are underperforming the broader market by 50 basis points the day after reporting. This indicates that stocks are ultra sensitive to earnings reports. Multiple earning misses, for example due to a pandemic, could lead to a broader market sell-off.  
* **Goldman's and BoA's indicators are signaling negative sentiment**  
[Bank of America's sell-side indicator stood at 58.4%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/02/01/heres-what-could-spark-the-next-10-market-correction-bank-of-america-warns/?sh=175bf1ff2120) in January, two points away from indicating a ""sell"" rating for U.S. equities. Similarly, Goldman's risk appetite recently moved above 1, ""[a level that has previously preceded slumps](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-goldman-sachs-correction-risk-investors-buy-dip-2021-1-1029981958)"". Broadly speaking, investors are underestimating a decline, similar to 2009, according to Goldman. ""The market is rising on good news but choosing to largely ignore weaker data and rising infection rates,"" the team said. ""Rapid fund flows and highly correlated risk assets make a correction in the near term increasingly likely."" 
* **Multiple similarities to 2000**  
While I am cautious about painting a ""doomsday"" picture, it is important as a investor to accurately assess risk and study historic events to find present day correlations. Although past performances may not be indicative of future results, it always serves as a great guideline for traders and investors alike. We can assess, that current market conditions are pointing to many similarities to the 2000 tech bubble, which screams bearish sentiment for weeks to come. These were some factors that precedented the market sell off in the 2000 tech bubble and are present in the stock market as of right now.  


*Increased Risk appetite: ✔*   
*Increasing Retail participation: ✔*   
*Valuations disconnected from fundamentals: ✔*  
*Companies underperform following earnings beat ✔* 

&#x200B;

Given the state of the market, the likelihood of a market correction becomes increasingly likely. If a broad-market sell-off will happen, h**ow much will the broader market indices decline?** While this is hard to assess, current market support levels stand at 3,630 and 3,550. representing a 5% and 7% decline from Friday's close. Bank of America analysts predict up to a 13% decline, which happened at the peak of the tech-bubble in 2000. 

 Lastly, **Robinhood will certify in front of congress on February 19th.** If this will lead to any restrictions on market leverage, for retail investors or institutions a like, it would trigger a unprecedented market sell-off. Similar, rising meme-stocks would force the hand of hedge funds and decrease their long-exposure even more, potentially triggering a decline similar to Thursday and Friday."|2021-02-03 17:05:16.030449|../output/raw/2021/02/03/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170519.csv|DueDiligence|['ASONS', 'WHY', 'WE', 'WILL', 'HAVE', 'A', 'STOCK', 'ARKET', 'CTION', 'IN']|[]|['I', 'I', '$GME', '$GME', 'E', 'P', 'E', 'ATH', 'U', 'S', 'I']|['GME', 'GME']

my everyday work is math, numbers, computational modeling and stuff like that. And since the first time I saw this table yesterday (and saw it mentioned again and again), it somehow triggered my retard brain:

[Columns: Date; Number of shorted shares;  $ value of shorted shares \(based on previous days closing price\); Short interest rate](https://preview.redd.it/jjcq2x5plbf61.png?width=277&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb0d3ddecb0dbffe23c08670306a156cb480824a)

….obviuosly a Citadel fanboy if you check the tweets.

So, I started playing around with formulas and numbers a little. And to me it looks like a table of mixed formulas. If we assume that S3 changed their SI evaluating system on Monday from:

SI\_O = shorts(synthetic longs)/ float                                         (OLD)

to:

SI\_N = shorts(synthetic longs) / (shorts + synthetic longs)   (NEW)

like S3 stated in this post:

[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)

This means your new SI Rates can never be higher than 100%, because your base value will always be bigger.

If you accordingly rearrange the numbers, something like this would result:

&#x200B;

[Removed the mess!](https://preview.redd.it/st2r15q6nbf61.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbb2b45ae45fdc2d369021eba40f5e7026df718d)

Please check the first lines. I also recalculated the number of shorted stocks based on Fridays float estimates (51.04 million). I think someone simply took their new calculated SI and utilized the old SI formula to calculate the number of shorted stocks. If you have a look on Monday: We had a hard short laddering and at the same time they claim to have settled \~30 million shorts from Friday on a \~37.4 million trading volume day on Monday? How would that be possible?

However, people are shit ass lazy and maybe this is our glimpse at some close to realistic numbers? I know S3s data is also just modeled, but maybe this gives a good idea of their modeled numbers? I mean, those guys are not completely stupid and their models should in general be pretty accurate. Besides the obvious intentional formula mess.

This is looking much more realistic to me. What do I miss?

This is no financial advice at all. Just something that came up to my retarded brain. Maybe you would like to discuss… or let me burn in hell for it… :-)

For the ones interested, after some formula rearrangement:

SI\_N (NEW) is calculated by SI\_N = SI\_O/(SI\_O + 1)

But the FDA is really behind the LPAD process and Cormedix is the 2nd company ever to have a shot at receiving it - the FDA wants other companies to go after this and to make it attractive, so it is self-serving of them to approve DefenCath as a good example and case study.**

Obviously, the other bearish case is the drug not receiving approval, with a p value of 0.0006

The below might be entirely wrong, I'm fucking retarded please don't listen to me.

Over the past few days S3 has been publishing updated short interest on GME and it has no doubt had an impact on price. First they published regular SI% of Float metric but then they pushed S3 SI% of Float on the market which appeared to show a drop from >100% SI/Float  to <60% S3 SI/Float in just a few days (notice how these are different metrics). S3 SI% of float calculation is extremely misleading.

S3 originally was publishing a basic calculation for SI/Float. You simply take the number of shares sold short and divide by the number of shares trading (float). Okay simple. What this community took advantage of with GME was more shares were shorted than were trading. It was a brilliant trade for a bunch of retarded smooth brained apes like you. So what happened? Did the squeeze get squoze?

Well, S3 decided you couldn't short more than were trading (I'll let you smooth brains do your own research into the origins of S3 partners but you can probably guess) so, late last week they started pushing their own metric ""S3 SI% of Float"". From a post found [here](https://s3partners.com/notesonfloat.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=020321), they state:

>Stocks with SI % of Float over 100% highlight the difference between these two calculations. In early January, GME’s SI % of Float was 141.86%, while S3 SI % of Float was 58.65%. Just as no one can get five quarts of milk from a gallon jug, no one can short more shares of stock than exist.  
>  
>While the numerators in these calculations are identical (71.19mm were the shares shorted in both calculations), the denominator for the traditional calculation was 50.19mm (the float) and 121.38mm for the S3 SI % Float (float + shares shorted). The traditional calculation misrepresented the actual tradable shares in GME. The 141.86% is a nonsensical number, while the 58.65% reveals that there are not many shares left to short in GME, and that future trading pressure will predominantly come from the long side of the market.

Since you guy's can't read, what they did was make ""new and better calculation"". This new calculation is:

`S3 SI% of Float = Shares Sold Short/(Float + Shares Sold Short)`

They say this better accounts for the true liquidity in the market. Whatever. Not going to comment on the value of their metric but the IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW IS IT IS NOT THE SAME AS WHAT WE'VE BEEN GOING OFF OF.

This metric should be completely ignored IMO for the purposes of determining our progress on the short squeeze. I'll show you why with a pretty picture using their special calculation.

Assume you have a stock with a float of 100. This float is held fixed and somebody starts shorting. The graph below shows how S3's SI% of Float would change as more shares of this stock were shorted and float held constant (even though they think shorting dilutes the float). We'll see how this looks below:

[Theoretical &#37;SI\/Float Comparison holding float constant](https://preview.redd.it/op62fauaubf61.png?width=593&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d6da23e48e12a9aa92aff2d4ad9a66b05957b8d)

As you can see above, S3's calculation is very different from what we've been going off of in our pursuit of the GME short squeeze thesis. It's actually a fucking asymptote, you can never get to 100%. By switching to looking at S3's metric it looks like there's been a massive decrease in short interest when NOT MUCH HAS REALLY CHANGED.

TLDR: The squeeze has likely not been squoze and S3 Partner's SI/Float metric is not a useful tool for measuring it."|2021-02-03 17:05:16.030449|../output/raw/2021/02/03/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170519.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['GME', 'GME', 'SI', 'SI', 'SI', 'SI', 'GME', 'GME', 'RTANT', 'THING', 'TO', 'KNOW', 'IS', 'IT', 'IS', 'NOT', 'THE', 'SAME', 'AS', 'WHAT', 'VE', 'BEEN', 'GOING', 'OFF', 'OF', 'IMO', 'GME', 'NOT', 'MUCH', 'HAS', 'EALLY', 'ANGED']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

One missing piece of the puzzle. The company (GME) didn't talk at all on what happened in the stock market. Although large majority of [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) apes are gamers, the company preferred to stay silent. I would like to talk about it also here. (Edit: I thought it was well know, [Microsoft Official Partnership with GameStop from the official website](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/))

# GameStop didn't say a word about the stock market events, why? Can it be a very tight contract for a future acquisition by Microsoft?

**Their silence** is the main point here. **Why they didn't talk?** They were in the simple position to make a simple interview that was going be seen by all the world in stick and say: ""*we are looking forward to innovate. We can adapt our business bla bla new technologies and bla bla new directors*"". That's it, and that's obvious. What kind of company is not going to believe something like that?

Why in the hell GME didn't talk at all? they were surely able to say something vague and rhetorical in case they didn't really want to support us. They were also surely contacted by the press, and invited in some cool TV show. **It was their choice. They actively chose to not talk**. Maybe they thought that this is a bubble and they didn't want to make it bigger, still they were totally able to say bla bla innovation bla bla Cohen bla bla future. Or they were preparing some financial report and they were obligate by some boomer law to not talk at all. Or, maybe, they have a contract, an agreement with some other more powerful entity that is forbidding GME to talk on certain topics / under certain circumstances.

Let's imagine the last one. **Let's imagine that** **GME cannot talk due to some contract boundaries**. Contract whit whom? I would say **Microsoft**. Microsoft is powerful, big, rich, and they are partners already. Better: **strategic partners**. *What if this partnership is the first step for an acquisition?*

I know, anti-trust regulations can have something to say about it

That is what I see:

* **Blackrock** (I love Blackrock, high growth + 2% dividends annualized? lovely), **Michael Burry** (yeah, the guy of The Big Short), and [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/), all of them purchased a big chunk of GME. Why? did some of them hear some interesting rumour? Did they smell something that we didn't smell?
* New CEO. **Ryan Cohen** join the board to innovate the business completely. Why? someone else suggested this? He wanted to do it by himself? Press is pushing the narrative that Cohen put one foot out of his bed one morning and said: ""*I wanna be the CEO of GameStop*"". Randomly?
* Strategic **Partnership with Microsoft**. I don't know which one comes first, if this or Cohen, I guess some ape can check meticulously. You know how does it sound to me? It sounds like the first step to do an acquisition. Among all the solutions Microsoft chose to partener with GameStop. Ok. And if the partnership goes very well, what will happen? they will keep staying just partners?
* The value of GME shares just skyrocketed and **GameStop didn't say anything about it.** With no reason? They decided to not support the internet riot made basically by gamers or people in target (age / income / demography / interests / lifestyle). From a Marketing perspective doesn't sound right to me. Press, journalists, social media, TVs they wanted a comment from GameStop. Everybody was screaming for the official point of view from the company, and GameStop decided to stay silent. *Usually companies pay good money to go on TV*, this time it was going to be free advertising. So why they refused free advertising (free money)? For one good reason surely. What reason can it be? Must be a good one. A contract maybe? Yeah, it can be. And with whom? a contract with a big one. A big one like Microsoft? Maybe.
* The **average gamer** is getting older, and richer. Every guy born in the late 80s now has a job (should have one I hope). Good customer base, growing in numbers, growing in income, cannot go down = secure income for a company. ***How would you get them all (all gamers in the world) if you were Microsoft?*** Acquisition. The acquisition of a gaming company I would say can be one of the easiest, safest, fastest way available to get a big piece of this customer segment (gamers).

Rockets (or batteries) have been fueled – up we go! I’m not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice.

(**Sources in comments**)

Longer version

My investment strategy is finding a stock that will perform well in medium/long term. I usually try to take profits or cut losses within one year, so look for companies that should benefit from what is happening around the world (be it Covid, green revolution, retail industry tendencies). Today I’ll share my opinion about future of deliveries.

For quite a while there has been a buzz around drone deliveries. Be it Amazon Prime Air, UPS Flight Forward, DHL Parcelcopter (my favorite because of this ridiculous name), Boeing’s Matternet… Everyone with the capacity to is trying to jump on this ship. You can read more about latest developments and companies working in Source 1.

Why there’s such race to develop unmanned cargo air vehicles and autonomous flight technology you might ask? Well, drone doesn’t get sick, can workday and night, it doesn’t have to take breaks or spend half of it’s time chatting around or staring at its phone. It also doesn’t need any contributions to its pension fund or healthcare insurance (needs insurance nevertheless, but technical insurances should come at much better rate than insuring a ball of flesh against all that world could throw at it). Finally, drones don’t care if there’s pandemic raging outside or boogaloo boys are stepping on the grass around some government building.

Drone comes off for the buyer as a one-time purchase cost, thus saving loads of cash in the lung run. Many businesses are taking more ‘green’ approach to their business and calculate their CO2 footprint. Given that drones are powered by electricity (all the attention to the renewable energy, wink wink) it would also help business to boast about reducing carbon footprint while improving their efficiency.

One might think of one issue here: drones are cool and stuff, but what about the battery - it might not be able to cover required distance? Worry not, there are already solutions for this. Mainly ultra-fast charging stations (charge time: 5 minutes) or wireless charging hotspots (charge time: 6 minutes). Check out Source 2 and Source 3.

All in all I believe that drones have a bright future ahead of them and $*TAKOF* is one of the players in this industry.

**Company**: Founded in 2014, Drone Delivery Canada has developed a proprietary and patented turnkey drone delivery solution. The company is fully commercialized, operational, and revenue generating.

DDC has developed a drone delivery platform solution which is cost effective, highly scalable and can provide next generation logistic services to various market sectors including: retail, ecommerce, parcel & post, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, mining, oil & gas, logistics companies, Indigenous Communities, military and government agencies, in Canada and internationally. The Company’s patented, fully integrated hardware/software platform is used as a managed service in a SaaS business model. Drone Delivery Canada is fully commercialized, operational and revenue-generating, with a robust sales funnel of global prospects. [https://dronedeliverycanada.com](https://dronedeliverycanada.com/)

So far, the company has signed test flight agreements with several major corporations. A medical facility in Ontario, two remote First Nations communities in the same province, GlobalMedic, and Air Canada have all agreed to test the company’s drones. Last year, it also struck a partnership with European logistics/transport group DSV Panalpina A/S.

**Latest Catalysts**: Drone Delivery Canada plans to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into its disruptive drone delivery solution (Source 4); Drone Delivery Canada has been named to the 2021 OTCQX® Best 50 (Source 5); In January 2021, the FAA added new rules to 14 CFR Part 107 to permit the expansion of routine flights and created four categories of UAS for flights over suburban/urban areas (Source 6)

**Upcoming Catalysts**: release of Q4 and 2020 results; in July company started process to entering US market – at some point there will be announcement if this is a success.

**Industry Catalyst**: establishment of a legal basis for unmanned cargo air vehicles, battery technology and wireless charging developments.

Research by Goldman Sachs suggests the market potential could be as big as US$100 billion (CA$130 billion). Meanwhile, startups in the sector are nearly all worth less than $1 billion today (source 7 – claims $*TAKOF* has multi-bagger also discusses $*TAKOF* cash position).

Tony hawk just did his last 720 a week ago. Hes also in AMC. The celeberttiiries, actors, actresses, stages crews, writers, editors, cast, crews, sound effects, what do they all have in common. the mother fucking movies. thats right. well im a dumbass what does that mean. it means this is the beginning of the show of support from these people that count on theatres being open as their fucking career depends on it. Yeah I might not ever be in the same room as jennifer lawson or leonardo dicaprio. but when youre at the fucking theatre you are. people are sick of sitting at home from covid netflixing the office and jacking off.  They want to go out and get handies in a large bucket of butttery popcorn like the old times maybe hit a homerun in the back of your buddies car in the amc parking lot.

ima sit back and wait for other closeted celebs to come out and show their support for amc. but wait media might not let them cause they got their balls in a vice grip.

$BB went up today. Is that good for $BB investors & bagholders? Yes, you grunt, drooling onto your weighted blanket. But axchuaallly…..shit I don’t know I’m just a retard but I think the answer is sort of, only maybe. 

I updated my chart from yesterday. As we in the $BB gang already know, $BB's a [steady eddy space shuttle headed to mar](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/)s. If you even look @ the price anymore you're a puss looking at prices are for paper hands. 

But look at this fucking thing. 

&#x200B;

[Live by $BANG, Die by $BANG](https://preview.redd.it/qyd7aorh8cf61.png?width=546&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ffa10ba469718f6939f3eb9f85288d3ead95bae)

**Look at the correlation.** For the smooth brains – you might think yeah no shit those are the most common tickers on reddit so what. 

So WHatt??? This is a weird thing!!!! **There is no** ***fundamental*** **(yes many of you don't have that word in your vocab idc bite me) reason** for these stocks to trade tegoether. *Why the fuck would an Endpoint security company, a vidya retailer, a movie chain, and some Fininsh 5(g) provider trade in tandem other than just being meme stocks?* 

Re: the downwards movement, my hypothesis was [degrossing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-30/a-reddit-army-descends-on-hedge-funds-chained-by-risk-models?sref=NJllTNWZ)  / [margin calls on retail account](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamill/bb_dd_no_meems_part_2/)s - $BANG was the most commonly held basket in RobinHood accounts this past few weeks and dips get exacerbated by margin calls .

But….....what goes down must also go up. Said another way – What’s causing correlation on the upswings as well? **Why would buyers of $BB today also be buying a*****, a vidya retailer, a movie chain, and some Fininsh 5(g) provider****,* especially after the loss porn of the past few days? **And especially since the front page has been dominated almost entirely by $GME / $AMC ?** 

*BTW the reason some of the $BB GANG want a conscious decoupling (it's not you...it's us) from the memes (fuck the memes) is so that people can realize the true fundamental value of Papa Chen’s Cyber Co. vs. the continual austistic screeching about Janet Yellin and Melvin (newsflash Melvin got the fuck out already)*

Anyways – So the question is sure, initially some retards bought the whole $BANG before $GME blasted off, but why is that still holding true? My theory, having a number of acquaintances @ hedge funds (no none of them Melvin fuck you)  is - yesit’s WSB’s favoriate bogeyman - those very same hedge funds. 

As [Chamath so eloquently described](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/chamath-palihapitiya-closes-gamestop-position-but-defends-individual-investors-right-to.html) as he verbally tore CNBC a new asshoe, hedgies may wear infinitely finer suits and sport cleaner underwear but they chase the very same tendies. The dirty little scecret is a big part of what they do is **momentum chasing** – Buying what goes up and selling what goes down. 

Those initial shackles binding $BANG were the idiots here (including me) who bought $BANG in various combinations. But now those shackles are wrapped in **$BILLIONS$** of load-bearing momentum strategies. Long shorts funds. Market neutral funds. And, perhaps ***most hilariously***, the [black box quant strategies](https://www.ft.com/content/81811f27-4a8f-4941-99b3-2762cae76542) with Harvard PhD-designed models that probably – accidentally - now have a meme basket that they trade, punting on shares of $BB, $NOK, $AMC, and $GME like the most retarded amongst us. 

# TLDR – I LIKE $BB MID AND LONG TERM, AND EVENTUALLY IT NEEDS TO DECOUPLE FROM $BANG TO ACHIEVE TRUE GREATNESS. BUT IN THE SHORT TERM I AM PRAYING TO CHEETO JESUS FOR YOU $GME / $AMC /$NOK BROTHERS – FOR BETTER OR WORSE WE'RE ALL BONDED TIGHER THAN [VLAD'S CLENCHED BUTTHOLE.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-calls-robinhood-ceo-vlad-the-stock-impaler-and-grills-him-over-the-gamestop-saga-11612180184)

*PS If I were less of a retard I might try to design an option spread to take advantage of the (1) $BANG correlation and (2) the fact that $BB and $NOK swings are more muted. There’s $$$ to be made there I think some of you smart options monkeys figure that one out. Other interesting ways to make $$$* *- Betting on what tickers (Tootsie roll gang anyone?

I'm a millenial and have been in the stock market for about 5 years. POGCHAMP.

Twitch is the north american leader of live streaming and I would love to invest in it. Here is the problem: Amazon owns twitch, therefore if you want to invest in twitch, you need to pay for amazon shares. Twitch is a drop in the ocean.

The only equivalent companies I have found are $HUYA and $DOYU which are both live streaming leaders in china.

&#x200B;

**BOOMERS have actually shorted $HUYA stock for 35% of the floating shares.** I guarantee you that the shorting boomers don't have the slightest fucking clue how the business model of live streaming platforms work. They don't understand the strong sense of community that twitch builds upon and why people would donate money willingly to their favorite streamers. I have seen the twitch viewers grow from the past years and I don't see it stopping anytime soon considering millenials are growing older and so is Gen Z.

&#x200B;

I know that nobody cares about fundamentals these days but just look at those numbers:

HUYA sales in 2016 (In Millions of CNY): 796.904

HUYA sales in 2019 (In Millions of CNY): 8,374.501

&#x200B;

The growth of live streaming platforms is absolutely insane and I believe it is the future instead of regular T.V. The market cap of $HUYA is only 6.1 Billion$ which makes it even more attractive for WSB buyers if they decide to like the stock. Considering the huge spike of interest in the stock market by the younger generation, and the fact that AOC had 300k concurrent viewers on twitch when she was talking about the $GME saga. It shows the bright future of this industry all over the world.

&#x200B;

Also, the gaming giant Tencent ($TCEHY) owns shares of $HUYA so this literally can't go tits up.

&#x200B;

THE RISKS OF THIS INVESTMENT

&#x200B;

IMO, the real risk of this investment would be the content restrictions that can be imposed at anytime by the chinese government.

It doesn't concern me too much because even though they can decide to ban video games at any time, people still feel a strong sense of community with a particular streamer. 

At some point people do not even care for what video games their favorite streamer decides to play. A good example would be the streamer xQc on the twitch platform. 

My man can play overwatch/valorant and even chess. He will retain an average of 70k+ viewers every single time.

The shortage has affected Volkswagen, Ford Motor Co, Subaru Corp, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and other car makers. 

But why should we autists care about this shortage, Ticker $TSM. 

Now, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, ticker $TSM has only dipped their toes into supplying for the auto industry. 3% of sales were related to the auto industry in 2020. They are being pushed by these manufacturers to change routes to help supply for this shortage. 

From the article, ""In 2020, auto chips accounted only for 3% of TSMC's sales, lagging smartphones' 48% and 33% for high performance chips.
In the fourth quarter, sales for TSMC's auto chips jumped 27% from the previous quarter, but still only accounted for 3% of overall sales in the quarter."" ""Germany has asked Taiwan to persuade Taiwanese manufacturers to help ease a shortage of semiconductor chips in the auto sector which is hampering its fledgling economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.""
""The ministry told Reuters that it had received requests from both the United States and the European Union through ""diplomatic channels"" late last year, as well as from Germany and Japan this year.""

That's around 22.7 M shares short today

If we assume that any other transaction was a cover then:
New shorts (not covered) = 3.5 M

The data since 27/01 is more than 50% every day. Meaning more shorts overall. 

It's still possible Melvin is out (at least partially)
It's still possible that they are covering old shorts with new one (like cover a short at 30$ keeping open one at 90$, or averaging up), new shorts are supposed to be more expensive in term of interests though

*Δ* Delta: 0.3438Γ Gamma:  0.0055θ Theta:  -1.36ν Vega: 0.0534P Rho: 0.0052

&#x200B;

## What is delta and how is it used?

Delta is a useful metric to help traders measure the impact that movement in an underlying security will have on the value of their option positions. Delta is not a static number—it fluctuates due to a number of factors including the price of the underlying security, time to expiration, and volatility.

## The standard definition of delta is:

Change in the option price ÷ change in the stock price

## Why is delta important?

1. **Measuring expected change in option price.** Delta can be used to calculate how much an option’s premium is theoretically expected to change in response to a $1 move in the underlying security. For example, a call option with a delta of 0.50 would be expected to rise in value by about $0.50 if the underlying stock or ETF rises by $1.
2. **Calculating the percentage of price risk.** Delta also represents the percentage of price risk of stock ownership that is currently represented in the option. So, a call option with a delta of 0.70 has 70% of the price risk versus owning the stock outright. If an investor wanted a greater or lesser amount of price risk, they could choose an option with higher or lower deltas.
3. **Determining the probability that an option will expire in the money.** Finally, delta measures the approximate probability that at expiration the option will be in-the-money by at least $0.01 or more. Therefore, a call with a delta of 0.05 only has a 5% chance at that moment in time that the stock’s price will be higher than the option’s strike price at expiration.

2/3/21 **Delta: .3438**

**Every $10 up in stock price = +$3.438**

## What is gamma and how is it used?

Gamma is another widely used metric for options trading. It is most often used by traders with large positions, but grasping how it works can help any trader gain a better understanding of how options behave.

## The standard definition of gamma is:

Change in the delta ÷ change in the stock price

## Why is gamma important?

Gamma measures the rate at which an option’s delta changes as the underlying security moves. The gamma of an option reflects the change in the delta in response to a $1 move in the underlying security. For example, a call option with a gamma of 0.02 and a delta of 0.50 would be expected to change to a 0.52 delta if the underlying stock or ETF rises by $1.

&#x200B;

2/3/21 **Delta: 0.3438Gamma 0.055  (Delta+Gamma = .3493)**

**Every $10 up in the stock price = +$3.493**

&#x200B;

## What is theta and how is it used?

Theta measures the impact that the passage of time will have on an option’s price

## The standard definition of theta is:

Change in the option price ÷ one day change in time

Theta represents how much an option’s premium is expected to decay per day with all other market factors and variables remaining the same. For example, a call option valued at $3 with a theta of $0.05 is expected to be worth about $2.95 tomorrow.

Theta can change as the options get closer to expiration. For example, options with a significant time premium (e.g., those with strike prices closest to the current underlying security price) tend to see theta growing larger as expiration approaches. Another thing to keep in mind: Theta is exponential, not linear. That means the time decay of an option accelerates more each day as it moves closer to expiration.

## Why is theta important?

Time decay is an important concept in options trading. Theta is the metric that quantifies it, so that you can estimate how quickly you might make or lose money on an option strategy as time passes. However, remember that theta (like all the Greeks) is a theoretical estimate of what is expected to occur over time. On any given day, supply and demand in the market will determine whether an option’s price rises or falls.

&#x200B;

2/3/21 **Theta: -1.36 Decay  minus $1.36 per day**

**Current price: $10.83 - per day x minus $1.36 = $9.47 price tomorrow if nothing changes.**

## What is vega and how is it used?

Vega measures the impact that changes in implied volatility will have on the price of an option contract. Volatility can have a major impact on your options trade, so vega can be important for assessing the risk-reward profile of a given strategy.

## The standard definition of vega is:

Change in the option price ÷ percentage-point change in implied volatility

Specifically, vega represents the expected change in an option’s price for a one percentage point change in its implied volatility. For example, if implied volatility rises from 23% to 24%, a call option with a vega of 0.14 would be expected to rise in value by $0.14.

## Why is vega important?

Vega plays a critical role in determining the risk-reward potential of a potential option trade. If traders believe an option to be overvalued or undervalued, they may look at vega to decide which options and/or options strategies have the most profit potential.

2/3/21 **Vega: .0534**

**For Every 1% change in Implied Volatility (IV) = +$.0534 per pointi.e. 50% up would mean $.0534 x 50 points = +$2.67**

## What is rho and how is it used?

Rho measures an option contract’s sensitivity to interest rate changes, and is expressed as the expected change in an option’s value given a one percentage point change in interest rates.

## The standard definition of rho is:

Change in the option price ÷ percentage-point change in interest rates

How is rho used? For example, a call option with a rho of 0.02 would be expected to rise in value by $0.02 if interest rates rise from 2% to 3%. Rho can be positive or negative, but has the strongest impact on longer-term options and is often considered less important than the other Greeks by traders who focus on shorter-term options.

## Why is rho important?

In a low-interest rate environment, rho has a less measurable impact on option prices compared to delta, vega, gamma, and theta. Still, it is another metric that can be used to help understand how options are influenced by interest rates and may have some bearing on longer-term options positions.

&#x200B;

2/3/21 **Rho: .0052 = +$0.052 per 1% change in interest rate of borrowing sharesi.e. if borrowed shares interest rate goes from 19% to 29% = 10 points x .0052 = +$0.052 extra to the option price**

&#x200B;

# The Summary:

**For every $10 move up in the share price tomorrow; the options price will increase 35.13% (based on Case TWO)**

**Case ONE:**

\[IV is +1% and Interest Rate Increases by 1% and Common Share Price increases by $10\] = +$2.19**Gamma - Theta + Vega + Rho = total basic greeks**

**$3.493  -  $1.36 + ($.0534 for every 1% move in IV) + ($.0052 for every 1% loan interest increase) = +$2.19 (total basic greeks) / Current option premium price $10.83 = +20.22%**

&#x200B;

**Case TWO:**

\[IV is +30% and Interest Rate increases from 19% to 29% and Common Share Price increases by $10\]**Gamma - Theta + Vega + Rho**

**$3.493  -  $1.36 + ($.0534 x 30% move in IV= $1.62) + ($.0052 for every 1% loan interest increase = $.052) = $3.805 + Current option premium price**

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**SO PER EVERY $10 Move in SHARE PRICE, The Analyzed Option Premium Price Increased $3.805 or 35.13% from Last price on 2/3/21 of $10.83**

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR: **SO PER EVERY $10 Move in SHARE PRICE,The Analyzed option (Gamestop Corporation 2/12 160c) Increases $3.805 or 35.13%based upon Case TWO with 30% IV increase and 10% Interest Rate increase.**

&#x200B;

**If there is continuous BUYing and HODLing of shares and buying 2/5 call options  and the share price goes higher bc of diamond hands and buying by oldcomers and newcomers, the options price will continue to rise 35.13% every $10 increase in share price based upon Case 2 and can be even more as IV goes higher or Interest Rate borrowing % goes higher.**

&#x200B;

What would happen to the 2/5 Calls if the stock price rises every $10. Exponential Growth Possibly and the Final Squoze. The Share price needs to increase in a dramatic and volatile fashion even causing a halt on the way up.

&#x200B;

## What is delta and how is it used?

Delta is a useful metric to help traders measure the impact that movement in an underlying security will have on the value of their option positions. Delta is not a static number—it fluctuates due to a number of factors including the price of the underlying security, time to expiration, and volatility.

## The standard definition of delta is:

Change in the option price ÷ change in the stock price

## Why is delta important?

1. **Measuring expected change in option price.** Delta can be used to calculate how much an option’s premium is theoretically expected to change in response to a $1 move in the underlying security. For example, a call option with a delta of 0.50 would be expected to rise in value by about $0.50 if the underlying stock or ETF rises by $1.
2. **Calculating the percentage of price risk.** Delta also represents the percentage of price risk of stock ownership that is currently represented in the option. So, a call option with a delta of 0.70 has 70% of the price risk versus owning the stock outright. If an investor wanted a greater or lesser amount of price risk, they could choose an option with higher or lower deltas.
3. **Determining the probability that an option will expire in the money.** Finally, delta measures the approximate probability that at expiration the option will be in-the-money by at least $0.01 or more. Therefore, a call with a delta of 0.05 only has a 5% chance at that moment in time that the stock’s price will be higher than the option’s strike price at expiration.

2/3/21 **Delta: .3438**

**Every $10 up in stock price = +$3.438**

## What is gamma and how is it used?

Gamma is another widely used metric for options trading. It is most often used by traders with large positions, but grasping how it works can help any trader gain a better understanding of how options behave.

## The standard definition of gamma is:

Change in the delta ÷ change in the stock price

## Why is gamma important?

Gamma measures the rate at which an option’s delta changes as the underlying security moves. The gamma of an option reflects the change in the delta in response to a $1 move in the underlying security. For example, a call option with a gamma of 0.02 and a delta of 0.50 would be expected to change to a 0.52 delta if the underlying stock or ETF rises by $1.

&#x200B;

2/3/21 **Delta: 0.3438Gamma 0.055  (Delta+Gamma = .3493)**

**Every $10 up in the stock price = +$3.493**

&#x200B;

## What is theta and how is it used?

Theta measures the impact that the passage of time will have on an option’s price

## The standard definition of theta is:

Change in the option price ÷ one day change in time

Theta represents how much an option’s premium is expected to decay per day with all other market factors and variables remaining the same. For example, a call option valued at $3 with a theta of $0.05 is expected to be worth about $2.95 tomorrow.

Theta can change as the options get closer to expiration. For example, options with a significant time premium (e.g., those with strike prices closest to the current underlying security price) tend to see theta growing larger as expiration approaches. Another thing to keep in mind: Theta is exponential, not linear. That means the time decay of an option accelerates more each day as it moves closer to expiration.

## Why is theta important?

Time decay is an important concept in options trading. Theta is the metric that quantifies it, so that you can estimate how quickly you might make or lose money on an option strategy as time passes. However, remember that theta (like all the Greeks) is a theoretical estimate of what is expected to occur over time. On any given day, supply and demand in the market will determine whether an option’s price rises or falls.

&#x200B;

2/3/21 **Theta: -1.36 Decay  minus $1.36 per day**

**Current price: $10.83 - per day x minus $1.36 = $9.47 price tomorrow if nothing changes.**

## What is vega and how is it used?

Vega measures the impact that changes in implied volatility will have on the price of an option contract. Volatility can have a major impact on your options trade, so vega can be important for assessing the risk-reward profile of a given strategy.

## The standard definition of vega is:

Change in the option price ÷ percentage-point change in implied volatility

Specifically, vega represents the expected change in an option’s price for a one percentage point change in its implied volatility. For example, if implied volatility rises from 23% to 24%, a call option with a vega of 0.14 would be expected to rise in value by $0.14.

## Why is vega important?

Vega plays a critical role in determining the risk-reward potential of a potential option trade. If traders believe an option to be overvalued or undervalued, they may look at vega to decide which options and/or options strategies have the most profit potential.

2/3/21 **Vega: .0534**

**For Every 1% change in Implied Volatility (IV) = +$.0534 per pointi.e. 50% up would mean $.0534 x 50 points = +$2.67**

**Today was 373.1 IV - THAT'S CRAZY VOLATILITY.**

**The 52-week high for IV was 400.**

**There's a chance this breaks 400 tomorrow. ($.0534 x (400 - 373.1) = +$26.95 potential**

**Implied Volatility for Gamestop Corporation:**

**Current	        373.1**

**52-Wk Avg	97.3**

**52-Wk High	400.0**

**52-Wk Low	33.1**

## The standard definition of rho is:

Change in the option price ÷ percentage-point change in interest rates

What would happen to the 2/5 Calls if the stock price rises every $10. Exponential Growth Possibly and the Final Squoze. The Share price needs to increase in a dramatic and volatile fashion. If 2/5 and 2/12 options are bought up and share price increases dramatically, the price will continue to go up infinitely until the shorts cover or are margin called.

I've been eyeing this company Canoo (GOEV) for a little while. I'm long 1200 shares @ a cost of $15.28

[https://www.canoo.com/](https://www.canoo.com/)

Canoo is a new EV start-up that plans to have a vehicle subscription service. From their investor presentation, it looks like they estimate $90,000 revenue on a car over 12 years. That means the cost per month for their subscription model is $625 per month, all in, no down payment, no insurance cost, they take care of maintenance, etc.

Link: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ea125677ex99-2\_hennessy.htm?fbclid=IwAR2as\_F2t-ZrmXWjKGvDLROdeSmL5ByctPw3W0VuqEcOHYjZggG3d5FX4T4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ea125677ex99-2_hennessy.htm?fbclid=IwAR2as_F2t-ZrmXWjKGvDLROdeSmL5ByctPw3W0VuqEcOHYjZggG3d5FX4T4)

Now, I know that seems a bit expensive but it seems that $625/mon is cheaper than the low end of the average of owning a gas-powered car at $750-916/mon. It has a barrier-of-entry because there is no down payment. I don't know how that will play out with most people. I personally like owning my own vehicle, but it could be popular with younger people because again, they wouldn't need to worry about any maintenance or insurance. Now, I do think their subscription model would be very popular among large companies that need a cheap, low-maintenance fleet of vehicles. I hope they're trying to land a contract with a company like UPS or FedEx.

What I like most about this company is their ""skateboard"" platform which is the bottom half of the car. From my understanding, they would just need to crash test one of each skateboard. Any vehicle, regardless of the configuration, would also have that crash rating, which is an amazing cost saving when they can sell a bunch of units to a larger car manufacture, like Hyundai, with whom they already have a partnership.

It is reported that Apple tried to buy Canoo in 2020 but Canoo turned them down. Apple has apparently partnered with Hyundai to enter the EV-space, I think because Apple really liked Canoo's customizable platform. Apple couldn't buy them so they joined them in a roundabout way.

Having said all that, they won't have any vehicles out until 2022 so be wary of that, but this is a long-term hold for me.

Canoo (GOEV) currently trades at $16.40, hitting its all-time high at $22.30 in December. So, it hasn't had a crazy break-out yet but I'm confident there will be one closer to launch."|2021-02-04 10:40:49.755973|../output/raw/2021/02/04/DueDiligence_flair_DD_104052.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['DD', 'EV', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'UPS', 'I', 'I']|['UPS']

I know nobody wants to hear this and I know it’s going against everything you all want to see right now but we need to face some serious fucking reality here.

Anyone who didn’t sell last week at the peak or around the peak, or on the way down, Welcome to the Bag Holders club. 

Now I know y’all are gonna downvote bomb me or be really upset about this shit, but it’s the fucking truth. 

We need to understand this and realise what our options are now. 

This place become a giant echo chamber of rockets and diamonds and “10k Is NoT A MeMe” bullshit. It was definitely a fucking meme and a lot of people got sucked into that absolute bullshit.

The big money bailed on us, they were happy to leave us bag holding if we were stupid enough to do it. (Spoiler alert: we were) there are no such thing as ladder attacks, everyone looks fucking stupid when they say this, the OG members of WSB are laughing at us all in a hidden thread. 

There is no squeeze coming. There is no more big money buying in. The squeeze narrative is gone, we can hold until we’re old and dead and out autistic grandchildren have our stocks, it doesn’t matter anymore. 

You need to realise if you’re still holding now, you’re now a long term investor. Congratu-fucking-lations. 

This is now a value play. Long term.

The reason I personally got in was because I believed this from the get go, before I knew about a fucking “short squeeze”.

I realised Ryan Cohen and his team are going to turn GameStop around and it’s going to be beautiful. Imagine getting on Netflix before it was Netflix, while they were still shipping DVDs? This is where we are with GameStop right now. 

The price will increase again, it will be valuable but it won’t happen for a long time. And it probably might not ever go to $400+ again. (Sorry bag holders at $400+) 

You’re a long term investor now if you’re still in. You’re options are this. 

1. sell for a loss now.
2. Hold and be patient, have faith in RC and the process.
3. Keep being a delusional idiot and getting laughed at. 

That’s it. That’s the options. 

My position is 150 shares of GME at an average of $70. I’m bag holding with you idiots.

So if you've been seeing the headlines of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer addressing marijuana, you're probably considering getting some exposure to the marijuana industry. Not a bad idea. I think it is a great opportunity, and it's where most of my investments will be in 2021.

But let me tell you about an interesting opportunity within the cannabis sector. $APHA (Aphria) and $TLRY (Tilray) are set to merge by end of April or May, and together will form the largest cannabis company in the world. $APHA is purchasing $TLRY, but the new company will move forward under the $TLRY ticker. So what does this mean? 

Well, currently, the price of $APHA is $16.75 and the price of $TLRY is $25.75. The exchange rate for the merger of $APHA to $TLRY is .83. For every 1 banana from $APHA, you get .83 $TLRY bananas. 

Lets say I buy 1 share of $APHA today at $16.75 and the merger is tomorrow. My 1 share of $APHA will convert into .83 shares of $TLRY. At $TLRY current price of $25.75, your .83 of a share is now worth $21.37. Remember, you only paid $16.75, and now it is worth $21.37 just based on the details of the merger alone. 

This also works with options, which makes me *rock hard.* Your contract of 100 shares at a certain SP, will represent 83 shares instead after the merger **but keep the strike price.** You can *literally* buy deep ITM call options at a steep discount. A $25 $APHA call is OTM, but ITM for $TLRY. However, just so you're aware, in this case your max delta of your option is 83 instead of 1.0. meaning instead of getting a $100 to $1 move, you will get $83 to $1 move. 

I know what you're thinking. ""Well that's why it's discounted dumbass."" And you'd be wrong. Let's take a look at a couple call options and their prices..

**APHA calls only go up to $25 right now, even 2 years out. So I'll be using $25sp**

$TLRY $25c Jan 2023. That option is $1,218 to purchase, or $12.18/share. 

$APHA 25c Jan 2023. That option is $610 to purchase or $6.10/share. 

You're losing 17% in share control of your option, but buying at a 50% discount. 

Anyway, not financial advice. Just babbling. Could all be made up while I wait for my crayons to heat up. Plus prices can change, but beyond your average red day there's no reason to expect a hard nose dive from either company at the moment, and instead looks like it should be a good year for cannabis overall. Maybe the best year ever, especially as an American, but we will have to wait and see.

They report their earnings on 02/23 and they're going to crush it! I personally think it's pretty cheap and it'll definitely have a run up. $SQ has two Lines of Businesses: Seller and CashApp. The Seller segment includes Square's managed payment services, software solutions, hardware, and financial services offered to sellers. The Seller segment generated $409.3 million in gross profit in Q3 2020, up 12.5% compared to last fiscal quarter. The other line of business is CashApp which is like Venmo meets Robinhood. They offer retail trading for stocks like $AMC, $NOK, B\*T\*C, etc. and they charge a variable cost for each transaction. Hence, high-priced asset purchase = higher fee. High volume purchases = more $. And then of course, you have your cash wallet.

Here are my bull points:

**Seller Segment:**

* Between November 5 (last ER) - February 23 (upcoming ER) there was Christmas, Boxing Day, Cyber Monday, New Year's and Thanksgiving. These are are all holidays that Small Businesses highly benefit off of
   * Retail sales will be up and same store sales will be up. Hence, more $ for $SQ.
   * Considering their Q3 revenues were up vs. last fiscal (when COVID didn't exist) and last quarter, Q4 revenue will be tremendous.
* More small businesses are open compared to last quarter. Vaccine started being distributed late 2020 -> more people shopping outside -> more small businesses profiting -> more $
* Most states (including businesses) are open ([https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html)).
* 2nd round of PPP: Credit lenders approved $5 billion loans in 1 week starting 2nd week of January 2021([https://www.fool.com/the-blueprint/over-60000-round-2-ppp-loans-already-approved/](https://www.fool.com/the-blueprint/over-60000-round-2-ppp-loans-already-approved/)). Small businesses aren't going anywhere and are here to stay.

**CashApp Segment:**

1. There was a very strong correlation between B\*T\*C and $SQ, but the derailment happened near the end of December. While B\*T\*C discovered new ATHs, $SQ remained stagnant. **Not priced in!**
2. According to survey results, 40% of retail traders who switched brokerages when the $GME, $AMC, etc. trading restrictions came about, they had migrated to CashApp. From this survey data gathered, Mizuho gives a PT of $300 ([https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3237659&headline=SQ](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3237659&headline=SQ)). **Not priced in!**
3. $PYPL earnings came out and claimed that C-currency had a big influence. Meanwhile, more C-currency is being traded via CashApp. **Not priced in!**
4. B\*T\*C trading volume nearly doubled vs. last quarter, and yet $SQ has only risen by 15%. **Not priced in!**

 **Other Bullish Points:**

* 1% of $SQ's asset is in B\*T\*C. B\*T\*C nearly 3x'd in the past 3 months. Meaning their B\*T\*C asset value 3x'd vs. last quarter. **Probably priced in.**
* CashApp 7th most downloaded in app store:

**Bearish Points:**

* The gremlin look alike that is Jack Dorsey is currently selling
* $ARKK is lowering the weighting of $SQ and $PYPL

**Assumptions:**

* EMT
* B\*T\*C doesn't crash before earnings

corsair has just announched about closing on public offering by selling insiders shares( of their highest owners -EagleTree which reduced ownership from 78% to 68%)  8,625,000 shares 35$ per share with 30-day option to buy another 1.13M shares.

in addition to that some of the executives of the company sold sold shares at 35$ which can be expected because it is the first time they cashed since the IPO.

&#x200B;

**RISKS:**

* there's a risk associated with corsair bussiness which is they depend on third-party computer hardware, particularly graphic cards and CPUs, and video games. - if any of the above will see a decline  it may hard crsr business. - every year there's new GPUs, CPUs and video games, and corsair will be there to provide their equiment ! i dont see this bussiness declining soon, quite the ooposite - when people will get back to work they will have new money to spend on their PCs and game consoles, and dont forget about new stimulues.
* if eSports wont continue growing at the current rate and according to the excepted growth - there will be harm to sales.

&#x200B;

POSITIVE:

* gaming and creator becoming pupolar and keep rising at the moment.(not due to covid)
* part of corsair products are used for ""3 letters forbidden word"" mining.(GPUs and Power supplies)
* alot of rgb product that attracts young audience.
* variaty of products to all costumers (20$-1000$+)
* still and young company with a very promising future ahead !
* covid lockdowns made alot of people more aware to computers and gaming
* Alot of influencers marketing corsair.

i think that corsair is perfectly positioned to continue growing, at the current rate they are a value play at a steal price. streamers and youtubers marketing corsair products and as a result corsair can expect to keep their growth in sales. they can generate billions each year in the up coming years and i really think they are under valued right now.

combine that with the crazy time we live in, shortage all over the world for GPUs, CPUs and gaming consoles - the demand is crazy and corsair will benefit as well.

at 21, jan corsair just filed [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312521011458/d32212ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312521011458/d32212ds1.htm) because of their latest ""offering"".

why do we care about that ? thanks to some guys from r\\investing i found that that apparently their next earning are already out and nobody talking about that.

**For the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect:**

**• Net revenue to be between approximately $1,700 million and $1,701 million**

**• Net income to be between approximately $101 million and $103 million**

**• Adjusted EBITDA to be between approximately $211 and $213 million**

Yes, we already know they have beaten their own updated estimates…

In fact, the company initially estimated the following (*from Q3 release* [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))

For the full year 2020, we currently expect:

• Net revenue to be in the range of $1,616 million to $1,631 million.

• Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $178 million to $184 million.

• Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $187 million to $193 million.

Then, they updated the *guidance on November 30th 2020* ([https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook](https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook)):

For the full year 2020, we currently expect:

* Net revenue to be in the range of $1,651 million to $1,666 million.
* Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $186 million to $192 million.
* Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $194 million to $200 million.

**So they have beaten their own initial and revisited estimates. Great!! Really great!!**

**2)** But that’s not all we can easily infer from the Prospectus dated January 21, 2021 (Again… we just need to look).

As they mention on the Q3 report, “as of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $370.1 million”.

In the more recent prospectus (page 10):

*In addition to the foregoing, as of December 31, 2020, we expect to have approximately $133 million in cash and restricted cash and we expect to have net debt of approximately $194 million following the repayment of $50.0 million in existing debt with cash on hand during the quarter ended December 31, 2020.*

**This means that they have reduced net debt from $250M ($370 - $120 of cash) to $194M, which implies $56M of free cash flow generated during the quarter.** As a reminder, they generated around 21M FCF in q3 2020 and 94M in the first 9 months of 2020. So **this implies around 150M FCF in 2020** (as a reference in the first 9 months of 2019, they had negative FCF of about 6M).

(check cash flow statement at page 14 on the Q3 report here [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))

And about their operation statement which looks pretty promising, this is how a growth stock looks, i see a bright future for them.

30-35$ good support level, below that is a problem.

flag pattern been breached upward ! hoping to see 40$ holding strong and coming close to 50$ before er ! i believe the er run didnt even happen yet.

TLDR: Corsair is a straight up strong tech company which holds greater value than the market see right now, earnings on feb\\9 will be fire and beyond the earning i see a huge growth for this company. possibility of reachin 60$ after er is HIGH. play by your own risk.

It is possible, but people need to stop being next level retard. It is going to kill any opportunity to recover the stock unless we stop right now and get our heads straight on what's actually going on. So while I don't know shit and this isn't real financial advice, here's a more rational take on what we need to do to get GME moving again.

Full disclosure: I was in GME in early December at around $15, I was a pussy ass paper hands and folded a winning play of $35 call for Jan 15th when it looked more and more unlikely. I got back in immediately for Feb 19th calls and turned 4k into 70k. I took some profits on the way up (I felt bad for doing so but I knew it was the big brain move, and in the end I pocketed 40k on 4k investment so 0 complaints from me). I'm still holding $115 calls made when the stock was $70 for Feb 19th, and made more 250 calls recently for Feb 26th and Feb 12th at $130 and $100 yesterday. I'm holding all of these till bust, so I'm in it to the moon. I have some shares too but those are a long play, I don't look at them.

First, we need to accept or at least be open to the idea that the original short squeeze is done. The factors that led to it have changed, either the hedge funds reshorted at higher prices (around 200 most likely), or they can out last us because they know they have bail outs and the media has put the momentum against us. WE CANNOT COUNT ON THE ORIGINAL SHORT SQUEEZE TO REVIVE THIS STOCK. WHAT WE NEED IS AUTHENTIC BUYING AND NEW MOMENTUM.

On that note, stocks can move ridiculous prices on low volume. What we need is real, authentic retail buying at prices up to at least $200. But right now GME looks like a sinking ship and no one wants to touch it with a 100 foot pole. So how do we fix that? We still have momentum on our side from a large number of believers from around the GLOBE that want a part in this once in a lifetime story. This is powerful but has to be used right, and that's hard when the brokers are shutting us out. But hope is not lost, and restrictions should lift over time. We need patience and resilience.

We also need to stop telling people who aren't in this for the moment to hold till they die. Some people are losing REAL money over this and we're being complete assholes telling them to hold till they lose their life fortunes so we can make some tendies. Weak hands are going to sell and pressuring them to hold will make the FUD worse. If we want a come back we need the selling to stop, and that means we need to let the weak hands fold WHILE keeping the floor price above a certain level. Let's talk about volume. The recent 'low volume' isn't low compared to the past months, its just lower than the day when GME was THE MOST TRADED STOCK IN THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD. Stop talking about volume. REAL selling has happened, which is probably the institutions and the paper hands folding. We need to let this energy run its course. Don't act like it's going to the moon and to buy at any price, save our bullets for the hard line in the sand.

Once the selling has stopped (and it will), we just need to regain momentum with organic buying.  People all over the world are waiting on the sidelines for GME to look like its picking up steam again and they will PILE THE FUCK ON just like last time. If we push the price high enough, we can trigger another short squeeze but it is NOT the same conditions as the first one. Stop with the bullshit about ladder attacks (which I've only heard of on this reddit) and us being cheated by the big man, that only scares people away because they think the game is unwinnable. It is STILL a giant fuck you to wall street just by making this stock rocket again, the game does not have to be rigged to make this a david vs goliath story. Whether it is or isn't, that only creates more FUD.

This sub needs to get its shit together. We need real authentic I LIKE THIS FUCKING STOCK for reasons OTHER than the short squeeze. Like GME just adding a fucking Amazon employee to the board and plans for it expanding online. There is REAL REASON to believe in GME, and that needs to turn into authentic buying, which will then create the momentum we need to get everyone else to pile on the stock again. But this shit about short squeezes and ladder attacks and $10,000 or bust needs to stop. It's just making this look like a sinking ship where everyone on it is stuck in the denial stage of grief. This stock has real potential to hit $300+ again, we just have to change our mind set and the game plan. And I'm too stupid to tell you how, but I know this isn't the way. So buy the fuck out of GME at current levels, but change the narrative to something that has actual basis in reality. And tell people to let the sellers sell so they stop keeping us down and we can get a real rally going. We have enough people on our side to move the needle and get the engine started again, its not over. But its gonna require patience and time and if you aren't in it for the long haul or are gonna pussy out on the way up then just sell now so we can start buying again. At this point, if you're not buying, either get off the ship or hold till death do us part.

A few Canadian retards up north eh, got out the igloo, sobered up and got the town together, eh. Said towns are buying GME$ using a canadian broker for US stocks. They pointed out they were getting slapped fees upside the head without knowing. There are some simple steps.

1. I purchased BB.TO in Canadian funds, then requested my broker via email and chat (qtrade) to JOURNAL the positions to BB.

2. Two days later I had BB in USD purchased by Canadian funds.

3. Sold said positions and received USD profit and re positioned for GME 🚀

4. There are a number of stable ETFS for a journalling including DLR.TO.

5. I just used an example of myself. May or may not be fiction.

Ape TLDR at the bottom you smooth brains

While researching batteries, I came across a corporation by the name of Energous (WATT). They are the leading the charge in a phenomenon called over-the-air wireless charging. Aka charging small electronics without needing to be contact with a surface or corded power supply, instead the device is charged by an RF transmitter.

Their primary product is called WattUp, the RF transmitters that allow them to charge devices over a frequency with a variety of applications - drones, medical devices, laptops, etc.

They have recently partnered with NewSound in December and received FCC approval for a WattUp enabled hearing aid, to eliminate the need to replace the small delicate batteries.

FCC approval for a WattUp enabled posture tracker.

They also have the first FCC permitted non-beam forming transmitter with a charging area of 1 meter, and a total of 230 patents as of Jan 2021. 

Finally, as of Jan 5th, they have completed a $40m at-the-market equity offering. 

This technology has incredible capabilities and could soon be found in any electronic device imaginable, and Energous is at the forefront. 

Currently shares are at 3.5~ from an all time high of 22.44. Currently both ITM and OTM options are pretty cheap with a nice average volume. 

Oh yeah earnings are 2/24

Positions - 1000 shares @ 3.34 and 3c 3/19

Ape scratch head. Ape tell ape friends.

Okay, clearly there has been a lot of weird info out there and it is hard to know what is what when it comes to just about anything related to GME (or anything related to last week). Quality information is hard to come by outside of you retards.

That being said, short interest Tuesday was up to 20% of traded shares from 18.5% Monday and an average of \~17% last week ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)).    Today, that number spiked to 25%. I'm retarded, so I won't feign that  I   really know what this means. But it seems to this retard like 1/4     shares purchased today were sold short, and yet the stock held its price   (of course it did, we love this stock). I only have the brain capacity for two theories, and I'll happily take suggestions from the comments.

1. Shorts were all opened after the intraday peak around $108 to smack it back down to \~90. Given the all our posts are public information and we are clearly down to the diamond fuckin handers here, this seems a risky play for anyone that isn't already invested in the short side of this stock.   Confirmation bias: MOASS part 2 is still on. *EDIT: Turns out it is relatively cheap for massive firms to short right now (between 10 and 20% borrow fee), which furthers my idea that this was what happened.*
2. Most of the shorts opened this time were smaller short positions opened by boomer retailers crazy enough to gamble on this stock returning to its  ""fundamentals"" (wtf are those?). These smaller short positions didn't flood the market fast enough to counter the ask slappers that believe in the MOASS's part 2.

The MOASS would have happened last Thursday. It's why we are pissed. It's criminal brokers interfered with the will of the people. It's insane how coordinated the misinformation that ensued was. Now it's personal. It ain't over ever. I continue to like this stock. Daddy Cohen's got a vision.

Disclaimer: I buy high and sell low, so what do I know. Nothing here is financial advice. That should be obvious by the fact I titled this ""short interest"" instead of ""short volume""...

Had to get that off my chest.

The animosity between bulls and bears on $GME lately is absolutely ridiculous. **BEARS**: It's not ""how this sub always was"" to completely shit on people for holding a position. Let them do whatever the fuck they want and anticipate the loss porn for breakfast the next day if you're so sure they're screwed. As long as you're ONLY dealing with money you have to lose, and not liquidating your ROTH to play a gamble, then you have every right to be here and invest like anybody else.

**BULLS**: However, the number of people saying it'll still go to the moon and downvoting every opposite opinion they see is a huge issue. They know that this event will likely stay on people's minds *for years to come* \- especially with the different studios trying to capitalize on the situation and sentiments real time - but that does not mean much for the longevity of your play. Already this week we see that we're at a point where we can exhaust the capital from the people willing to invest and lose all of our money in the process.

I'm personally **bullish GME, 69 $GME@98**, and it sucked to see the whole squeeze kinda fizzle out and into what it is now. Even though I'm anal about it, I'm **\*not using emotions to dictate my investment\***. I truly believe in the value of Gamestop under Cohen and the new VPs they signed on today, and a tiny little part of me is still invested in the idea of a potential squeeze in the next few years that I'm still not selling.

Truly, we \*won't know for sure\* whether there's the potential for another squeeze, short or gamma, [until those numbers come out from the FINRA this next Tuesday the 9th](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest). I've heard some say that it got delayed to the 15th but I haven't been able to find the source on this myself. Since the opinions on this are so binary, there will be \***\*no way of knowing whether this is all conspiracy or not\*\*** until we have some guaranteed bonafide proof that the shorts **\*\*ARE OR ARE NOT\*\*** in.

Until this point,  it is baseless to make a case about whether the squeeze is still on or not. Even the slightest confirmation towards the squeeze case will likely induce another gamma squeeze, since attention will be redirected toward a short-term high growth %; conversely, even the slightest vision that the shorts are out and we're sitting here floating in space will likely tank the stock with sales across the world - and definitely kill a conspiracy theory or two. The stock would likely only go back up when the

For this key reason, I think this situation is a 50/50 gamble. If you'd like to keep the gamble going, or feel like the losses aren't worth realizing, then fuck it. You do you. I hope you research opportunity costs related to bagholding and are willing to pay them as you move forward as an investor. If you're **\*not\*** willing to take the gamble, then **\*don't\***, and stop dicking in the ass everybody who's willing to make a truly retarded play; after all, the spirit of this place isn't so black or white...

**\*TL;DR we don't know what the fuck is going on, but it's your choice what you do with your money. Pay attention, but don't let hecklers** ***\*\*or\*\**** **theorists obscure your vision of the future\***

Recap. 

•Melvin/hedge funds short GameStop. Twice. 

•Xbox/Microsoft GM becomes acting GME CEO- 

•Chewy founder CEO buys in/submits prospectus to Board regarding GME transformation Microsoft/GameStop collaboration is announced

•➡️ *it was held back that they get revenue from partnership with Xbox game pass* ⬅️•

Now-we also have Elon and Mark weighing 
 in with expert advice (hey-I’m not a millionaire so they know more than me) 

And add in the market crashing, silver spambots, margins canceled, social media shut downs and all of a sudden limit buying in shares the day after all time highs. 

Very. Suspicious. To say the least. 

next?  

We know what’s next. 

GME magically recovers as the darling of Wall Street while we got manipulated again. 

But. The story takes a turn. Billboards start appearing across the country. Melvin can’t take a drive to the local Wendy’s anymore without seeing “GME to the moon”. Finland buys in. Saudia Arabia buys in. Japan buys in. The mother f@cking Times Square has GME to the moon lit up for the world to see. 

This is uncharted territory here folks. I know what Wall Street wants to happen. The media is pumping it right now. They have DFV in their beady sights. They want to see us fall. Again. 
But. It’s a new world. 2008 and the VW short squeeze didn’t have Twitter. 2008 didn’t have an army of the working class sitting at their computers figuring out that Wall Street is not the God like money figure we have been told to be believe. The reality is that the Hedge Funds that “protect” peoples retirement are really just going off of insider knowledge and the ability to manipulate the market in mass. 

It’s not 2008 anymore. I think the world has it right and they see that WSB/DFV made a damn wise call. They are the ones trying to hold the share price up every day facing down the hedge funds with sheer determination to be validated and paid. 

What they have attempted to do is criminal. It’s not 2008. 
The world is legitimately watching and showing support in this in a way I don’t think anybody expected. Especially in 2021. 

I’m holding. I don’t want to. This isn’t an example of my normal trading-having every single trick used against you.. to the point that it’s simply pure lunacy that we are witnessing.

To actually want to question a member of WSB for market manipulation. Seriously.

I cannot in good faith sell and leave everyone standing alone trying to do the right thing. Ive already lost the money. 
My retail money did the DD. They just cheated.

I wish you all the best, and it is the biggest trading mistake of my life so far.  I was talking about GME with my friends in March 2020, and even did trade some options then for a loss.  I must have read DFV at some point, as we were discussing Burry and a ""technical short squeeze"" happening.  But I missed the real boat, so good on DFV and all of the rest of you degenerates.  

Instead, I focused my market attention during quarantine on precious metals.  My opinion is that in the long term (10+ years) they will provide the only real hedge against inflation in the world as every CB on the planet is exploding the supply of fiat to deal with COVID economic disruption.  

In the short term, I believe that the ""powers that be"" are engineering the largest short squeeze in the history of markets.  We do not have the power to effect whether this happens, it is simply an inevitability.  HFs, banks, and other large institutions are going to extract an enormous amount of wealth from the world during this squeeze.  This money will be taken from the future pocket of every consumer of industrial goods for the next several decades in the form of inflated prices on everything: batteries, electronics, solar panels, EVs...even jewelry and silverware.  

We cannot stop them, but I have decided to try to hop on for the ride.  The last few months aside, I never saw WSB as a force for societal change, because the people who control the money are always going to win the most in the end.  WSB is a place where we can learn the tricks of a market that is structurally rigged against us, and use those tricks to our advantage.  To use an analogy that I think we all know: I am not, and will never be, Ender.  But I can learn that the Enemy's Gate is Down, and play The Game that way.


**The tl;dr is this: the market for silver is the most manipulated physical market in the history of the world.  $SLV is the vehicle that is currently being used behind the scenes to vaccum up ownership of every available physical bar of silver in major bullion vaults in the world.  When it has completed doing that, the ""paper"" markets that have held down the price of silver for decades will become disconnected from the physical markets.  The energy that has been artificially held back for decades by this paper will explode the price of physical silver, and I have no idea how high it will go.  $SLV will stand (mostly) alone as the world's exchange traded product for electronic trading of physical silver.**



# LET'S START AT THE BEGINNING: WHY IS SILVER IMPORTANT?

Silver has been used as real currency for thousands of years, and there is an argument to be made for returning to ""sound"" money through the use of silver and gold.  However, that is not the argument that I am making.

Silver is a highly industrial metal, and it's usage for industry will only continue to expand as we electrify the future.  Silver is important for electrical applications b/c it is the most-conductive / least-resistive metal in the universe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity#Resistivity_and_conductivity_of_various_materials).  It is used heavily in all electronic applications (even more since RoHS has pushed us away from Tin/Lead and towards Tin/Silver solder blends, with silver being added to mitigate the longevity problems of 100% Tin solder growing Tin whiskers and shorting out components).  But the largest new demands on silver are going to come from solar panels and EVs.  Utility-scale solar is now virtually tied with wind as the cheapest new sources of energy in the world and is only getting cheaper every year.  As fossil fuel plants continue to reach the end of their service life, they are going to be replaced with solar and wind technologies.  As EVs become more prevalent, their components (ESPECIALLY their batteries) will produce additional demand for Silver.

As smart investors are wont to do, this coming demand for industrial silver has been front-run and large quantites of silver have been sucked into investment products so that they can produce financial returns when demand begins to increase.  2020 showed remarkable investor interest in silver, to the tune of an estimated 350Mtoz moving into exchange traded products like $SLV.  $SLV alone added ~200Mtoz of silver to it's holdings in 2020.

Unfortunately for the market, supply cannot meet demand: Of the 930.9Mtoz estimated for 2020 demand, only 236Mtoz was available for physical investment, because the rest was consumed by industrial uses.  This means that $SLV alone absorbed almost the entire world's capacity for silver investment in 2020, and as you'll see soon, this is only accelerating in 2021.

# LETS GET PHYSICAL, PHYSICAL

Now it's important to understand that huge amounts of ""silver"" is traded on ""paper"" markets, and these markets have historically decided the approximate cost of physical silver in the world, in the form of the ""spot price"".  I'm not going to give anyone a primer on how this works, go read about the London Fix and COMEX paper on your own time.  But the important thing to know is that there are a bunch of silver bars in vaults in London and in the U.S., and electronic claims on them are traded on the LBMA and COMEX continuously, without the silver ever leaving the vaults.  

However, these vaults have concrete numbers of physical bars in them, and trading contracts against them technically means that you can show up at a window somewhere and demand your 5x 1000oz bars that a COMEX warrant entitle you to.  This redemption happens all the time, and it can be used to extract physical silver from the unallocated storage at bullion vaults and release it to industrial or consumer bullion uses.  However, these bars can also be moved into ""registered"" or ""allocated"" accounts without them leaving the overall vault storage.  This means that a quantity of individual silver bars that an owner holds title to can be physically moved inside the vault onto a different rack, and the owner has individual serial numbers of bars that they own.  These bars can be withdrawn on demand only by their owner and are not available for general redemption of a COMEX warrant.

So how many bars are there? Well between LBMA and COMEX, there are 1480.3Mtoz sitting in vaults (sources below when I start doing math).  This includes all allocated AND unallocated bars.  Now, obviously London and NY are separated by an ocean, but people always like to bring up that bars could be moved b/w London <-> American COMEX vaults.  This is an enormous undertaking, but let's make a ""spherical chicken in a vaccuum"" level assumption and say that LBMA + COMEX vaults are a singular source of inventory for both $SLV and other market participants.

If you read the $SLV S-1 (which I did: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1330568/000119312505127244/ds1.htm) you would learn that the custodian of the $SLV trust is required to hold all silver weight (with an exception for 1100toz of unallocated, lol) that is owned by the trust in allocated accounts, where the individual bars are physically segregated inside the vaults, and the serial numbers of the owned bars are explicitly recorded.  The idea that there is ""no physical silver"" backing the SLV trust and ""you could get settled with cash"" is _ridiculous_.  iShares publishes a report listing every serial number of every bar that is owned by the trust, along with the total weight contained in the bars.  It is 10847 pages long (you can read it here if you have trouble sleeping at night: https://emea-markets.jpmorgan.com/metalicsWebAppJanus/publicUnauthenticated/BONY_SLV.pdf) and is updated frequently.

The underlying silver is _owned_ by the trust.  It cannot be removed from the trust unless ""baskets"" of 50000 shares are redeemed by an ""Authorized Participant"" which is only a few large brokers.  It cannot be removed by the bullion vaults and given to other customers because it is physically segregated inside the vaults.

People who have recently beaten down the idea of a silver squeeze love to talk about how JP Morgan is the custodian for the SLV trust.  And because JPM just paid a $1B fine for historical manipulation of the paper silver market, they aren't going to be honest about this.  This is crazy talk.

When it comes to the dishonesty of a big bank, there is ""fraud"" and there is FRAUD.  ""Fraud"" would be them saying ""Oh sorry, we didn't realize that a laundromat bringing in $300k/week of dirty dollar bills was out of the ordinary"". ""Fraud"" happens all the time, and the banks get away with it regularly.  FRAUD would be them saying ""Oh yes, 3rd party customer (iShares) who services dozens of other large banking institutions in the world, here is objective evidence, with serial numbers, that we have these silver bars in the vault"" and then just making up the data.  It is QANON-level crazy, IMHO, to think that JPM is going to commit FRAUD by publishing a list of serial numbers that is completely fake.  

I believe the exact opposite: since they _have_ just gotten caught, they are playing it straight this time and have just switched sides in order to go long.  On the COMEX alone, JP Morgan Chase is long 193.9Mtoz, or just north of $5B.

The problem for the futures and options markets is that their continual trading of paper contracts is chasing a smaller and smaller amount of physical silver that is not owned by $SLV.  And the market participants (minus, now, JPM) who have gotten away with naked selling of paper contracts and mostly settling them for cash are going to soon find the underlying vaults empty and no metal to give to warrant holders who come looking for it.



# HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM IS $SLV FOR THE NAKED SHORTS IN THE PAPER MARKET? LET'S DO SOME MATH.

$SLV inventory math:

$SLV is holding 669,357,789.40 troy ounces in trust, and has 720,500,000 shares outstanding.  

(If you are curious why $SLV/share trades below the spot price, it's because: 669.4Mtoz / 720.5M shares = .929 toz / share)

($SLV data from here: https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239855/ishares-silver-trust-fund?qt=SLV#/ )

(screenshot from tonight for posterity: https://imgur.com/a/0sqcMFr)


Bullion vault inventory math:

London (LBMA) silver stocks are 1080.5Mtoz (http://www.lbma.org.uk/london-precious-metals-physical-holdings-statistics)

US COMEX silver stocks are 399.8Mtoz (https://www.cmegroup.com/delivery_reports/Silver_stocks.xls)

669.4/(1080.5 + 399.8) = 45.2% of the vaulted silver in the world is already owned by SLV

Subtracting what SLV already owns, leaves us with: (1080.5 + 399.8) - 669.4 = 810.9Mtoz

(This is _completely_ ignoring the fact that a lot of that remaining silver is owned in registered or allocated accounts by individual owners.  E.g. there is 150.2Mtoz in ""registered"" on the COMEX which means those bars are already specifically deeded to an individual owner. But they could theoretically sell it to SLV so I included it as available.)

810.9Mtoz is the ABSOLUTE THEORETICAL MAXIMUM available in LBMA + COMEX silver that is not _already_ owned by SLV.


Now how short are the shorts?  Some more math:

OI on COMEX futures: https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/precious/silver-futures-and-options.html

    + 179786*5000toz
    + 130402*5000toz 
    +   8245*1000toz
    +   1903*2500toz
    ----------------
    1,563,942,500 = 1563.9Mtoz 
in currently open interest that could be demanded for delivery.  Just on the COMEX, there could be demand for twice as much silver as there is in the combined LBMA + COMEX vaults that is not explicitly owned by $SLV right now.  

Caveats: 

- I have not included any London futures contracts that may have claims on metal here.  I am not versed in their contracts at all and don't have a good data source right now.  If anyone knows how to calculate the short obligation for London I would be glad to add it.

- I have not analyzed any of the strike prices on COMEX options or dates on COMEX futures...some of them could be way out of the money or way in the future.  Many silver producers sell futures years in advance to lock in prices, and then deliver the physical to satisfy the contracts.

Using the same basic methodology–total shorts divided by shares [toz in this case] outstanding–as is used on a stock to calculate short interest (and gave us the infamous 140% short interest on GME) we get......drumroll please:

1563.9 short / 810.9 physical = 192.9% short interest.

**OPEN INTEREST ON COMEX SILVER FUTURES AND OPTIONS IS EQUIVALENT TO A 192.9% SHORT INTEREST AGAINST ALL LONDON AND U.S. AVAILABLE INVENTORY.**  

But it gets even worse.





# WANNA ADD A GAMMA SQUEEZE??

I pulled the data for all current OI in SLV options.  There is a large number (5.7 million) of call contracts open (here are the totals: https://imgur.com/tiqPA34)

Using the .929toz/share number, we can calculate that there are up to 527.2Mtoz that would have to be bought during an absolute runaway Gamma Squeeze.  Call options on $SLV max out right now at $55, so the spot price would only have to increase by around 122% to reach the point that all of that weight would need to have been purchased.  But at some point, it could become self-reinforcing, and the gamma squeeze continues to cause more gamma squeezing.  

I believe that this almost happened Sunday evening (2021-01-31) as evidenced by the huge premium that $SLV was trading to the futures price for a few minutes when trading opened.  (My comparison chart: https://i.imgur.com/UPjL3zm.png) 

The Silver ETF that trades on Sunday in Tel Aviv (https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TCHF82:IT) closed up >6% (and was consistenly rising for the entire session) before any american spot markets opened.  I believe that hedging algorithms at MM firms that write options saw this spike as a need to buy shares in $SLV to cover their deltas, and so they bought the opening of $SLV like crazy.  $SLV opened up 17.6%, while paper only opened up about 6%.  Paper market players had to sell 23.8Mtoz of paper in the first minute of trading to keep the price under control.  I have never seen an imbalance like this before, and it was covered up quickly (within 2 hours of trading).  But to me, it sounds like Vincent's heartbeat monitor in GATTACA when he runs out of fake signal: there was a cover up required to hide this explosion.

When the day comes that this cover up is not executed properly, stuff is going to get ugly, b/c $SLV won't just gamma squeeze like a normal stock...



# BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! A TRADITIONAL GAMMA/SHORT SQUEEZE WILL SEEM LIKE NOTHING IN SILVER

The squeeze in silver will be FAR WORSE than the combination of a gamma and short squeeze in a stock, because shares of stock cannot be removed from the market.  Eventually somebody holding $VW or $GME is going to say ""sure, I'll sell at $42,000.69 per share"" and that share can go back to cover a short.  But if instead of doing that, the holder of that share withdrew it from the market by converting it to a physical token b/c they thought that the physical token would be more valuable than the share (the retail premium on physical silver vs. paper silver), the short interest would INCREASE as shares were converted into tokens.  And since there are currently more ""shares"" of silver than there are bars of silver in the vault, the shorts can be caught with a literally illiquid market that has nothing to buy.

Zero.  Zilch.  No silver available.

The doomsday scenario (for paper silver holders and writers) is the following combination:

- holders of COMEX warrants will see the rising premium of physical bullion to the spot price and decide to redeem their warrants for physical 

- a rising spot price will Gamma Squeeze the writers of $SLV options into buying more shares in a runaway fashion and the trust will absorb all available vault inventory as it issues new shares

COMEX warrant holders who try to demand metal that doesn't exist will literally break the market.  

The CBOE will probably step in and decide to force settle the contracts for cash at the last known good price, and **COMEX paper warrants will cease trading forever.**

The physical market price will then be disconnected from the paper market, and $SLV as an exchange traded product will stand (mostly) alone as the new ""paper"" market for silver.




# SO WTF DO I DO? [NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE]

Well I could always buy physical silver, if I can stomach the premium and wait 8 weeks for it to show up.  Or, I could just get long on $SLV.  Since I believe that $SLV will stand alone after the dust settles as the one true claim on bars in the vaults, I could be long the actual $SLV ticker in several ways:

- Buying shares (duh, but it worked for $GME)

- Buying long dated calls (Gamma Squeeze go BRRRRR, but who knows when)

- Buying option spreads (my personal favorite)

If I wanted to maximize my contribution to the Gamma Squeeze, I'd probably buy as much Delta/$ as I could get using weeklies, which would be 2/5 $26.5C or 2/12 $28C 

(Max delta/$ calculations: https://i.imgur.com/Az3o85v.png and https://i.imgur.com/eRPQo6k.png)

Current open positions for me are: (https://imgur.com/vWZrziG)

- Jan'22 50/55 call spread (costs .17, moonshot pays $5, 29x)

- 4/16 40/55 call spread (costs .18, moonshot pays $15, 83x)

- 2/5 $26.5 call (to maximize delta/$)

- jan'22 $40 call (to minimize risk of missing the big one)

- $AG shares and jan'23 10/35 call spread (added, sorry i forgot this one: https://imgur.com/fz80V6J)

***I will simplify this very easily so new retards can understand this simply.***

1. Short Interest: ***This is ultimately why we got in***. **I don't care if you like the stock or not. We all want money at the end of the day, and that's the truth.** We really want those who shorted the shares to finally buyback the shares. The interest rate did drop from 140 to 120. This was a guarantee on the robinhood fiasco day. **That was only 20%**. And we got the confirmation from multiple sources. I am using highshortinterest.com which I do understand is not updated as frequently but it did update on that day. It comes as a huge surprise to me that 120 dropped to 51%. Either they bought it from other hedge funds at a background deal, or the day Robinhood manipulated the prices down, that rise up was the shorts selling. Thus we got back to 300ish from the low of 110. In this case, it has squeezed. **In the case it hasn't, the shorts are actually screwed if we just hold (we need a short interest update with actual legitimate facts, I do not know where to get this information besides the website stated. Do not listen to S3 partners, as they have gone back and forth with bs. Its an estimate)**

&#x200B;

2) **GME & AMC are following the exact same pattern**. This is a huge sign of manipulation. Although that shouldnt come as a surprise. When Robinhood let traders sell, shorts were able to cover for cheap as fuck. **THEY COMPLETELY SCREWED THE MOMENTUM, HOWEVER THIS CAN EASILY CHANGE, AS THERE ARE MORE BUYERS THEN SELLERS.**

3) **Silver diversion**: Let me just say this. GME AND AMC are basically the same situation but different Short interest. **If they wanted to divert from GME, they should of said we moved to AMC. But no they specifically mentioned silver. That is a huge sign, and this cannot be understated more that they want to close the movement.** You really need to think about how the news is reflecting this, and how it still continues to reflect it.

4)  GME is still testing grounds: GME is actually hovering 80-100. Like actually??? How is this even possible. We are still in the squeeze.  **If it crashed we would actually be at 40 right now.**

5) Short Ladder attacks: I was super hesitant to believe this shit. There's no actual sources, but we do have crammer in a video saying what hedge funds do in desperate circumstances.  The legimatacy of short ladder attacks is comparable to the following: This is basically like saying the assassination of Kennedy was not an actual hit, and when cocaine was brought into America, we just didn't have the resources to stop it from coming.

**I AM GOING TO BE HONEST, people definitely paper handed at this short ladder attack**. **This would actually bring their short interest down a bit, while keeping the stock price at a safe level.**

&#x200B;

6) **People are on our side. Listen carefully. We can actually win. I was retarded and thought this was going to be easy.** Of course it wasn't gonna be. Did you know why the Volkswagen short squeeze happened? Because one smart dude decided to hold and not sell, forcing high interest rates and shorts getting margin called. This is inevitable if we drive the price back up, they will be forced to buyback the shares.  **WE ALSO HAVE THAT ONE DIAMOND BALLS FCKER> DFV.**

&#x200B;

TLDR: HOLD 🚀🚀🚀

While my girlfriend was out with her boyfriend and i was playing with my Lego, i figured out what is going on, i am gonna make it very simple, because my brain does not allow me to make complex thoughts, so here goes.

First, we know that Melvin cuckital and other Hedge bros shorted heavily GME, the SI was 200069% and the strike should be fairly low, which leads to a short squeeze, now at this point the losses they were looking at was at the Billions or more ( that's a lot of money, in case you dont understand). A lot of apes here think that they are trying to floor the stock so they can cover their asses and not pay out, but here is the catch, THEY DON'T.

If HFs have so much power to destroy a stock while the price and volume is so fucking high combined with the fact that they can do this while the world is looking at them, then they would be Gazillionaires by now. If a HFs can create so much swing in a stock like GME, then what prohibits them from doing so in a smaller stock with much lower volume and make a shit ton of money all the time, the SEC ??? Fucking lmao if you thought that

My point here is, that we are overestimating their powers and i am going to explain why.

We got the news that shorts covered their positions, which everyone thought was BS, but i believe they actually did, and here is how.

We know that Melvin got around 50 Bn capital a few days ago, so how did they persuade investors to give them money??? Did they tell them they will try to manipulate the stock and bet that people will sell off, do you think rich people heard that and said ""Oh yeah, great idea, lets bet 50bn that retarded apes will panic and sell off"", fuck no, they proposed a real plan, that would not bet on us doing sane things and i am gonna tell you their plan and why it makes sense.

They know that GME is a ticking bomb, they know that people want GME to MOON, so they hedged their bets by manipulating the stock to drop at 80-90, possibly lower and buy a fuck ton of calls to hedge their retarded bet.
They feed the MSM with BS, manipulate the market, so the price drops, then they buy a fuck ton of calls/shares so they will limit their losses or even make more money. S3 partners, media, RH have started acting like our friends now, isnt this a bit suspicious??? It is, because they now want the stock to fucking rocket, so their friends can get their money back.

So what happened is, Melvin got money to buy calls, fed media BS to drop the price and buy calls at good prices, now the media,S3 and RH are with us, the stock will rocket and they will hedge their bets and cover their asses, it all makes sense.

Edit: I am kinda retarded and dont know how to use symbols so more people can understand, sorry

- Low volume doesn't matter. We've seen this before. Although high volume is usually an indicator that a squeeze is happening, in this case it's just Melvin fucking with us and playing psychological warfare.

They're trying to make it more and more difficult to hold and make us feel more and more stupid for not just giving in, but it's exactly what they want. Go for a walk if you can't look at the price of the stock. This is a new paradigm, it literally doesn't matter at this point because of the fundamentals.

Stay strong! You'll get your tendies soon. At this point we're like Jonestown, just financially rather than physically!

I'm not a financial professional, so I cannot say with certainty that such attacks are possible in practice, but what I *can* say is that they were in fact described by others well before the GME thing. I'd like to believe that the individuals claiming it's a WSB meme are just ignorant, but it may be just another attempt to manipulate WSB. So let's set the record straight.

This blog post from 2008 describes a ""short down ladder"" attack used by shorting hedge funds:[https://shareholdersunite.com/the-ioc-files-useful-background-material/short-sellers-and-naked-shorting/](https://shareholdersunite.com/the-ioc-files-useful-background-material/short-sellers-and-naked-shorting/)

This public comment on the SEC site from 2008 about how counterfeit shares were used to manipulate the price of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac:[https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf)

Thanks u/Professional_Fig7437 for mentioning that this practice was previously called ""painting the tape.""  This SEC article describes an incident where the price was driven up, not down.

>placing successive buy orders in small amounts at increasing prices  (painting the tape) 

[https://www.sec.gov/news/digest/2008/dig082808.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/digest/2008/dig082808.htm)

I vaguely remember another SEC document being posted here last week on the topic, but can't find it anymore. If anyone has a link to that or other documents, please PM or post in comments.

All of these documents roughly describe the same process of selling counterfeit shares back and forth to lower stock prices. Now, again, I cannot say for certain that such attacks are really possible. But I can say that they were *not* invented by reddit.

Now, I do not think the 100/200 share orders we've seen are proof of this. Nor do I think we've seen these attacks every day. However, I'm fairly certain we saw this attack specifically on the day RH blocked buying. The massive decrease in buy pressure would have allowed hedgies to freely trade back and forth without risking their shares being bought. RH blocking buys and ladder attacks combined probably caused the crash we saw that day.

And finally, back to GME short positions. For those wondering if Melvin has indeed covered their short position already, this article summarizes the possibility that they have bought synthetic longs from a MM (Citadel) instead: [https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/)

&#x200B;

# I. current Situation

As all people here obviously noted, there is a war going on between hedge funds, retail investors and other people in the background including media, reddit, celebrities.

Everyone has their play, everyone wants money, fame, leverage, whatever.

There is a split here in reddit, some just want gainz, some want to keep the ""movement"" going, and some kinda want both.

&#x200B;

**FYI I'm neither.** I'm not invested in GME or anything else, as a matter of fact, I'm a stock virgin. I'm a pretty high earning, not 1% high, but I get a fucking good salary for my age and this will only rise. So I'm not in financial danger in any way, but I have close relationship to my money in terms of not losing it.

I wanted to buy GME, but at any given point except last wednesday I was looking at dangerous numbers either too volatile for me to get in or going down.

&#x200B;

# II. what we REALLY know

We know: hedge funds shorted GME and others. We dont know from where exactly, we dont know exactly when, and as a matter of fact, we dont know how much. ALL the data we have is either outdated, not a good source or just flat wrong. SI might sit at 200% right now, that would tell us nothing. Those could be shorts started at 300 and hedges want to earn even more, those could be shorts started at 20, 90 or 180$.

&#x200B;

At this moment, **even SI is not helping us making decision**s, even if we would know the true number.

We know the stock is very **volatile** right now, we dont really know why. Short ladder attacks are a myth, I hope this is cleared by now.

&#x200B;

What is **obvious**, is that there is market ""**manipulation**"". Manipulation derives from latin ""manus"", meaning by hand. That is for sure. We know hedge funds and even us change the stock price by hand somehow. If it is by buying, holding, selling, shorting, fake news, true news, whatever.

&#x200B;

# III. What does that all mean now

It means, the short squeeze could already be over, it could mean we are in it, but it was heavily fought against by any means including unfair ones. It could mean squeeze is still in the future waiting.

&#x200B;

What it means for the stock: It will stay volatile. It might stay at 90$ for some time, as long as retailes still buy in, and maybe even other hedge funds or whales. It might drop, it might even rise, **maybe hedge funds bought in right now and want to keep the momentum upward and sell at a specific point, crushing the price with retailers beeing the bagholders.**

What does it mean for us retailers?

Its dangerous to invest into this stock. Nothing is safe, diamond handing this could end in GME dropping to 20$ again and this might stay the case for a long time. It might work and stock price goes into 1000$.

&#x200B;

# IV. Whom are we fighting?

It is important to note, that we are fighting a multibillion dollar cartel of people who are deep into the stockmarket since beginning of stock trading. Basically, they know every trick and more. Do you guys really think, they have no idea how to fight retailers? They might do ""ladder attacks"" because they shorted the stock again and now stop, just to buy into GME? They might want us all to hold just so the price rises until EXACTLY 299$ when they will sell 10mm shares and price drops to 90$ again.

They might want to ride the rocket to the moon, too. They might want the whole stock to drop to 10$, who knows.

&#x200B;

It is important to know, that they analyse this whole sitation and make their own plan.

&#x200B;

# V. What is the danger here?

&#x200B;

This is a reddit. We are 8,5mm degenerates on this sub and latest after last week hedge funds are monitoring this. So what is the problem? If reddit is monitored, they might even use this, for example, **they know a ton of people will cling to this stock with their life, not even thinking about selling if it is 98% down**. I have no fucking clue what a good trader could do with this info, but I'm betting it is dangerous for the people on here invested in GME.

&#x200B;

# VI. What shall we do, what is the future?

&#x200B;

I have no fucking clue. Personally, if I already had invested in GME, there would be 2 possible situations:

I got in below todays market price. For example like all those guys with 10k shares at 20$. They are still hugely in the green. I personally would propably have secured some cash at 400$, but I would definitly secure some cash now, depending how much I'm in. I would keep at least a good portion of the stock in hopes in goes moon.

&#x200B;

If I got in above todays market price, let's say at 150, I would think about getting out anytime the stocks goes above 100$ again and try to minimise my loss, IF the money is a lot for me or I need it.

&#x200B;

If it is gamble money, I would stay invested, but would be pessimistic enough to not hope for rocketfuel.

# VII. What if the rocket goes moon, when do I sell

A false impression that was created here is that everyone, at any point buying into GME would make tons of tendies. That is WRONG. Usually, in situations like this, early adopters make tons of tendies (DFV for example or anyone who got in at 20$ dollar range). Then at some point, let's say stock price hits 1000$. Now what happens if everyone and their mother sells at exactly that point? First 10000 sellers get their 1000$ price. But pretty fast, price drops immensly. This will end in a downward spiral (see VW short squeeze graph). With tons of people not making huge bank or even lose money, IF they got in late. (think 300$ range and sell the last)

&#x200B;

So what could be an exit strat be?

**I would say, the later you got in, the earlier you sell.**

That makes sure you exit in the GREEN, and not accidentally in the red. I wont sell at 350 if I got in at 300. But I wouldnt wait out a mass selloff and then might drop under 200$ and still lose money after I tripled my money.

&#x200B;

**Last words from a stock virgin and TLDR:** This whole story is crazy and cool, and **I hope all of ya earn tons of tendies**. But PLS for the love of god, IF stock raises again and you see overall black numbers, and this is your fucking **retirement money**, GET IT FUCKING BACK and cash out. This is not a game.

This whole dream of becoming a rich tendie ape is not worth beeing homeless because stocks treat retailers like bitches. This whole thing might work out. But you're against a multibillion dollar cartel that does EVERYTHING to make money or keep money. They shit on every rule, just to stay on top.

Just because someone hypes up a stock doesn’t mean that you should invest. It’s always up to **YOU** and the amount of time you’re willing to spend **RESEARCHING** the stock. I know that’s not what WSB initially stood for, most of us just came here for the loss / gain porn. But now that the attention of SEC, media and hedge funds has been drawn onto us, it’s important to differentiate hype and rational, critical thinking. 

None of us here buys stocks because **SOMEONE** tells us to do so. We make our own fucking choices and we accept the losses and welcome the gains. 

Regarding the current situation: based on informative posts and comments I’ve had the pleasure of reading, it looks like it’s going to be a long and weary battle. But at the end of the day, what differentiates you from a paper handed bitch and a legitimate retard, are the reasons behind your investing decisions. 

***Do you really believe that GME is an undervalued company (in general)? Do you believe that GME has the potential to expand into something truly beautiful and magnificent, especially after all the traction the company’s been having over the course of last month? Do you trust the company?*** 

If you do, then you’ve got nothing to worry about - even if the stock price dips to $50-60. Investing’s never about making a quick buck, sure there are those who get lucky every now and then, but if you invest with the “I make quick gains” mindset, chances are you’ll lose. Because you’re investing in a highly volatile, unpredictable market that has a history of crashing at the slightest of inconveniences.

**Hello SEC! Thank you for reading my due diligence on Silver. Please note I am not inciting a short squeeze I'm just telling people that I like SLV and why they should consider liking it too. I am not a financial advisor and we are all individuals acting of our own accord. If you want someone to investigate try investigating the hedge funds and corrupt brokers.**

&#x200B;

Before GME gang downvotes:

Listen up this isn't r/GME this is r/wallstreetbets I know you have your battles to buy but we shouldn't miss out on SLV just because you guys like GME still. OF course dont sell GME to buy SLV just hold and wait for the squeeze but we must recognise that SLV is ACTUALLY a legit play.

&#x200B;

If you want to check that i'm not a robot send me captchas and ill do them for you

&#x200B;

Recently there have been a few posts about SLV, but I tried to wait until the GME hypes has died down to post this. This DD will be split into two parts:

1. Why SLV in on itself is a good and safe investment (Boomer DD)
2. Why SLV has moon mission potential (WSB DD)

**We should not miss the silver play just because we are currently in GME. You guys may not know this but its actually possible to hold more than one type of stock at the same time.**

**The Boomer DD (Source: goldsilver.com)**

*Why silver is a good investment*

Silver cannot be created out of thin air. It cannot be printed.

Silver has no counter-party risk. Physical silver does not rely on another party making good on their contract. Silver also outperforms Gold in bull markets.

&#x200B;

[Gold vs Silver](https://preview.redd.it/bjnbtrtjpgf61.png?width=1386&format=png&auto=webp&s=4536c7c77ab04631c9de08daf8caae9dc2c6ba11)

Government inventories of silver are also falling. Since silver does have industrial uses, in the future these industrial demands will be difficult to meet. This is because governments no longer hold large stockpiles of silver due to the fact that they no longer need the silver to make coins.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8uf985knpgf61.png?width=1388&format=png&auto=webp&s=41c26d5a8d97396556e07a1c9b5d218660cac6da

&#x200B;

Silver use in industrial production is also increasing.

There is silver in cell phones, things like self heating windshields, as a catalyst for the production of plastics and chemicals etc.

One key use of silver is its use in photovoltaic cells, which is the main constituent of solar panels. So silver is also a solar energy play. With Biden taking office, we can expect more production of solar panels and thus an increase in demand for silver that governments cannot fulfil.

Photovoltaic cells are those little tiny cells that you see on solar panels.  Read more about it [here](https://www.planete-energies.com/en/medias/close/how-does-photovoltaic-cell-work)

On average, a solar panel uses about 20 grams of silver.

&#x200B;

*Silver supply is dropping*

Silver prices crashed after it peaked in 2011. As silver dropped 72.1%, silver miners had to find ways to cut costs to keep turning profit. What they did was they dramatically decreased the amount of exploration and development for silver mines. As such, Silver production is in decline.

&#x200B;

[Chart for you](https://preview.redd.it/jd7j4f5tpgf61.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bf89b396074924c03685e65bcb4ae1556f7c90e)

&#x200B;

So to conclude the boomer DD:

\- Inflation is on the rise

\- Too much money is being printed

\- Silver outperforms gold

\- Silver biggest use is industrial use

\- Silver demand is increasing

\- Silver supply is dropping

**WSB DD 🚀🚀🚀🚀**

&#x200B;

According to [coingape.com](https://coingape.com) , in order to pull short squeeze of hedge funds (not necessarily JP Morgan), we would need silver to go to $500

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Some tweet they put on their site idk 🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/6dej6iowpgf61.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=e33a578db6f235c5e14b7d420637ce7936838b6d)

&#x200B;

Of course, I am in no way saying that we should short squeeze silver ( Hello SEC! )

I'm just saying that I really like SLV stock, and you should consider it for the above boomer reasons. There is also an additional upside of the fact that IF for some reason many people bought the stock it would squeeze upwards infinitely. This is because unlike the GME short squeeze, where GME can issue new stock, a silver short squeeze could continue until they manage to mine more silver, because silver cannot be printed.

Also, we saw a lot of hedge funds trying to interfere with the GME short squeeze. Robinhood restricting bought GME shares, brokers being gay etc etc. The difference with silver is brokers do not control how much silver we can buy, and all the new people who just joined WSB in the daily discussion thread going ""Hey guys i'm a newbie can someone please tell me whether stocks are going up or down today and also how can I buy stock also which stock is going up the most today thank you"" can also join in. If a short squeeze were to happen, this is how it would happen.

1. People buy SLV stock (not random ETF's because they don't buy physical silver)
2. Silver price go up
3. JP Morgan ANGRY
4. Robinhood and other brokers experience ""temporary outages"", ""Buy button glitch where buy button disappears for some reason"" , ""Limiting SLV shares that can be bought""
5. WSB and noobs who don't know how to buy stock can just go outside and buy physical silver bars or coins. Or since we are in a pandemic order it off eBay or something

Basically, the special thing about silver is that more cannot be printed and that buying it cant be restricted in any meaningful way.

Whether or not large banks like JP Morgan are actually short silver is a different discussion that other people should write about because it's heavily debated and I don't know the answer, but what we can CONFIRM is that HEDGE FUNDS are short on silver.

Maybe in the future first place will get a silver medal and second place will get gold

&#x200B;

**Rebuttals against the bullish case on silver**

I have been drafting this message for a while, and at the same time have skimmed a few anti-silver posts. The common points against this is

\- One contract is too expensive

\- People who don't know how to trade futures will get stuck with it

\- Its taking attention away from GME

&#x200B;

*One contract is too expensive*

The contracts you are referring to are the futures, aka paper silver. There are three ways to buy physical silver

1. But silver futures and take delivery
2. Buy SLV shares
3. Buy Silver from jewellers or online sellers

There are currently around 5 times more contracts for silver in the COMEX markets than there is supply of it. This means that when you buy SLV futures and exercise it, the person who sold it to you would have to scramble to find someone who DOES have it. Once we do this, they will start to realise and register to complete lack of silver there is in the market. Companies like TSLA, Samsung and Canadian solar have been accumulating a silver stockpile, because they know that supply is dwindling. People have bought all the reasonably priced silver online too, if you don't believe me check for yourself.

&#x200B;

*People who don't know how to trade futures will get stuck with tonnes of silver and delivery fees*

See above

&#x200B;

*Its taking attention away from GME*

I am not being paid by anyone to write this, i just genuinely see the potential for it. While I do agree that GME is still relevant, it doesn't mean we cannot have other stocks in our portfolios. We shouldn't miss out on silver just because we are still in GME. Besides, a SLV squeeze would be much more beneficial than the GME squeeze because of my last point below.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Last and most important point - the benefit of a silver price rise**

**When GME prices go up, who benefits? Shareholders, hedge funds who are long GME, banks, etc**

**When BITCOIN moons, who benefits? Banks, rich people, people who have the education and means to figure out how to buy it, people who have access to bitcoin wallets, brokers etc.**

**When we blow up stocks like GME and BTC, even though we profit, and even if we bankrupt hedge funds, the money goes to other hedge funds or rich people who can afford the risk to own GME stock.**

&#x200B;

**BUT WHO OWNS SILVER?**

Almost every household owns some silver. Whether its' bars, coins, or religious statues. Poorer countries and places, like Asia and Africa, most households have a small silver chain, a family heirloom, ornamental utensils or ornamental gourd bucket I don't know.

If silver prices moon, money goes to the people, even though yes some will go to rich people who are long on silver, silver is something that poor people are also shareholders of. If we can get silver back to its FAIR VALUE, through the reasons and HYPOTHETICAL methods I mentioned above, we can not only burn hedge funds, profit for ourselves, but also help poor families.

Poor people don't how to set up a brokerage account and buy Gamestonk. Poor people don't know how to trade cryptocurrencies. Poor people don't have the capital to enter into the stock market. What they DO have is gold and silver (mainly silver).  When they don't have the knowledge or ability to buy shares (As proven with the recent influx of people with ""What is a broker"" kind of questions), they get left out of these massive wealth transfers. Its much easier to say ""Buy silver lol"" than ""Ok so open a brokerage account with a broker that does not block meme stocks and that suits your needs, verify all your information, deposit money and make sure the risk you take aligns with your risk tolerance and the amount you are willing to lose....""

If you want to bankrupt hedge funds, don't transfer wealth from one hedge fund to other hedge funds who are long GME. Instead, transfer wealth from the hedge funds to the pockets of poor families.

TLDR WSB DD: If silver goes back to its fair value then lots of poorer people will benefit from this along with you. Also silver buying cannot be restricted because you don't need a broker to buy silver. (IF YOU ARE READING THIS DITCH ROBINHOOD AND CHANGE BROKERS. IF YOU DON'T CHANGE BROKRS THEY WILL KEEP DOING THINGS LIKE THIS \[When you don't pay for a product you ARE the product\])

Regardless or whether or not we take part, silver will get to its fair value. Although it would be faster if we joined.

Obligatory Disclaimer 1 – this has nothing to do with GME, I’m not encouraging anyone to divest their GME holdings. This is a medium-term play anyway so all you GME holders without extra cash can wait to see your short squeeze thesis play out and then come into this in a few weeks or whenever. Oblig Disclaimer 2 – this is not financial advice of any kind, please do your own research. I am not a financial advisor, I do work in the US as a risk quant for a pension fund (not a hedge fund) but the fund does not invest in any of the below and I personally make no investment decisions, hence being able to post this.

Brief bit of info/background on me – I’m a cross-Atlantic cross-breed, i.e. an American-British kid. 30 years ago my dad went to the US on business and met my mom who was working as a cocktail waitress (no she wasn’t a stripper or working at Hooters before you ask). I’m also 30 years old myself so draw your own conclusions about my backstory (just keep them to yourself pls). Oh yeah, as a kid a child psychologist diagnosed me as mildly on the spectrum (for real) but I think she was full of shit really. Other than that I’m a pretty boring/ordinary guy generally. My investment thesis is anything but boring however.

Moving on to the idea (you don’t care about me or my backstory anyway). Actually before then let’s talk a bit about the UK (or “England” as you Americans always call it in movies). I’m sure you guys think us Brits all sit around in tweed coats drinking tea and acting like Hugh Grant or the cast of the Crown, but in reality the UK today is pretty Americanised (London anyway). London is also the biggest financial centre in the world after New York, our banks are up there with your big boys JPM, Citibank etc. Also Oxford University (rivaling Harvard) just invented a Covid vaccine.

So onto the investment. Currently I have a significant amount of my portfolio in a 3x leveraged ETF in the FTSE 100 (index of the largest 100 UK companies, equivalent of your Dow 30 really). As a British (as well as American) citizen, I can trade this domestically on Hargreaves Lansdown, but I’m sure you guys have access to various ETFs that give you the same exposure (Wisdomtree for example).

Despite the vaccine and strong recovery/quantitative easing, the FTSE 100 is still down -20% from its pre-Covid peak, in stark contrast to the DOW or S&P 500 which is at its all-time high. So why is this? Good question – let’s look at some of the biggest constituents of the FTSE 100:

\- BP – remember these guys, the villains from the Deepwater Horizon movie? Remember John Malkovich in his bad Southern drawl saying “we are a $115bn company”? Well currently their market cap is $50bn, so there’s huge potential upside. Yeah sure electric cars are coming along, but in reality oil is going to be still needed for a helluva long time, especially once air travel comes back. Plus oil is also used in plastics and pretty much every consumer material out there, it’s going nowhere anytime soon.

\- Royal Dutch Shell – same as above, except they don’t have a movie about them starring Mark Wahlberg

\- HSBC – seventh-largest bank in the world. Up until recently their share price was the lowest it’s been since 1995, despite these guys making bucketloads of money in normal times. Also if HSBC ever go under, that means the world financial system has basically ended. So this investment not working out will be the least of your issues

\- Barclays – same as above, except they don’t have any issues/concerns with being exposed to Hong Kong/China. Also their investment bank has been making out like bandits this year due to the volatility. No idea why the share price is so low.

\- Lloyds Banking Group – as above, another autist made a good DD post on here about LBG recently. Look that up as the adderrall is wearing off so can’t be arsed to repeat what he said.

\- IAG/British Airways – huge airline that’s obviously struggling right now. But they have tons of cash and will definitely make it out of this crisis. Also down around -50% from pre-Covid highs.

\- Unilever – the guys who make soap and washing-up liquid. Everyone will always need these (well maybe not the filthy autists on here like me)

\- AstraZeneca – they just invented a highly effective Covid vaccine. Enough said.

\- BHP – huge miner, $200bn valuation. They are actually trading above their pre-Covid highs but likely have more room to grow.

\- British American Tobacco – the Covid pandemic hasn’t cured addiction, people won’t stop smoking anytime soon. If anything it might go up as people are stressed by the pandemic.

The above are just a few (the biggest) examples of amazing value stocks in the FTSE 100. Of course this is WSB not r/investing, so we need some additional risk. That’s why I would suggest a leveraged ETF, to amplify your returns. (Disclaimer – leverage also amplifies your losses, please don’t invest money you can’t afford to lose).

Ok, you say, well what about the white elephant in the room i.e. Brexit? Well this is WSB not r/politics, so I won’t say that Brexit was a monumentally stupid decision by our elected leaders. But whilst Brexit will undoubtedly cause pain for the UK economy as a whole, the impact is mainly on smaller companies and businesses. Most of the constituents in the FTSE 100 are $5-10bn+ companies, for example banks are big enough that the legal expense of setting up a European entity is minimal (so they still get unfettered access to the single European market). So FTSE 100 companies shouldn’t feel much pain from Brexit in my opinion, at least not enough to affect this thesis.

Well what about the exodus/brain drain of finance and other professionals to Europe, you might ask? Well Paris is nice but French labour laws mean you can basically never be fired or made to work late, which doesn’t really work for most big companies. Frankfurt is a strong contender to London… except it’s one of the most boring cities out there. Imagine moving from New York to Fargo, North Dakota – except that everyone in Fargo spoke a different language (although judging from the TV show it seems like they may do anyway). That’s what it would be like for someone moving from London to Frankfurt (sorry Germany/Fargo).

Ok, so what’s the risk level of this trade? Well tbh I would say the risk/reward ratio is really good – with a leveraged ETF you could conceivably make 100%+ returns in the next few weeks/months. And thinking about it this is really almost risk-free – if the FTSE 100 tanks or stays low for the next year or two, in reality that means we’re all still sheltering inside and now living in the monstrosity of a film that was Michael Bay’s “Songbird” (plotline – Covid has mutated to be 90% deadly and we are all still in lockdown in 2024). So at that point you’ll probably be scavenging for food/focused on survival, even if money still exists I can guarantee you won’t be upset about any money you lost on this trade.

Oh yeah, also the FTSE 100 was down almost 9% last month (January). So investment timing is also on your side if you go into this in the near-future.

Autist out (again - pls do your own research this is all just my opinion/autism)

**TL;DR:**

\- Leveraged FTSE 100 ETF is a great way to make 50-100%+ returns over next few months with pretty low risk. Consists of huge oil companies, investment banks that aren’t going anyway but still down -50% from their peaks (for no other reason than we’re Britpoors)

# 1) Institutional Ownership of GME is over 100% of the float.

Blah blah blah, what's the big deal? Well consider this for a moment. If we assume that these institutional shares are essentially not in daily play (not exactly true because some of them are shares held for smaller accounts or whatever, but ignore that because diamond hands probably hold an equivalent amount to that portion), and we go ahead and assume that those institutional shares cannot be bought to cover a short (which they can but not easily/not quickly)...then:

EVERY SINGLE SHARE TRADED ON THE MARKET IS A SHORTED SHARE THAT IS OWED TO SOMEBODY.

That's right, every single share traded on the market is ACTUALLY AN IOU. That's INSANE. And for every share we (as retail investors) buy, that's an ADDITIONAL IOU.

I literally can't overstate how insane this is. This isn't just a short squeeze where there aren't enough shares....there are literally LESS THAN ZERO UN-SHORTED SHARES TRADED. This goes so far beyond a liquidity issue, I honestly don't know how clearing houses are even functionally capable of obtaining GME shares anymore. This thing will explode soon, because every share bought is just compounding IOUs at this point (on avg, obviously).

Forget the moon....🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 to some kind of permanent orbit.

# 2) Price movement during the meteoric rises

On Monday, Jan 25th, we had some huge spikes but only slightly positive movement. On Tuesday Jan 26th, price slowly climbed at an almost perfect line. This, I believe, was some shorts carefully, slowly covering and/or retail buying excitedly and/or a gamma squeeze due to the unexpected situation where every call from the Friday before ended up being ITM. Then between Tuesday and Wednesday, price **SHOT up afterhours from $150/share to $350/share**. Bloomberg had an interesting article regarding how approx. only $45m was needed for this price movement. On Wednesday, Jan 27th, the stock essentially traded sideways, with some big volatility. Then on Thursday, Jan 28th, many brokers suddenly restricted the ability to buy GME and the price fell sharply, but then rose again with additional movement after hours (likely MM's covering the newly ITM calls before Friday, perhaps some shorts covering). On Friday, Jan 29th, a twitter account belonging to one ""Kjetill Stjerne"" who may or may not be a reclusive Viking billionaire, tweeted that they would ""hold the line"" in light of the brokers closing and posted a bash script with a piece including something like ""hunt=shortsells"". While nobody can confirm if this is true (though he was for sure someone early on the GME boat, we don't know if he's actually wealthy, etc), all of us who watched the Level II Data stream on Friday saw that many of the ladder attacks (aka, rapid share dumps and/or shorts, below ask price and sometimes below bid price) were suddenly stopped when compared to previous days, and the stock, while very volatile, closed at $325 (essentially, sideways movement again, but with huge spikes/dips) leaving lots of call options ITM.

After Friday, the stock dropped starting Monday. It closed Monday at 225, and Tuesday at 90. I believe this was due partially to people selling (and panic selling), but also due to people shorting. It's important to note that volume was HIGHEST DURING the Friday before last, and then last Mon/Tue. Once the stock rose above $325, volume stayed relatively low and dropped until Tuesday.

What does all this mean? My opinion is that the spike was artificial. Someone intentionally raised the price using afterhours movements (why? I can hand-wave and give some options...but it's all speculation), and opinion of the stock was high enough to sustain that high price for a little while. Once that was evident, brokers across the board suddenly restricted the ability to buy shares (not just Robinhood), likely due to increased clearinghouse requirements, thus locking out retail investors. I personally also believe the Viking was legit, and he's the reason the price stayed up on Friday in the absence of retail buying, but that's my personal opinion. Which brings us to discuss the broker restrictions:

# 3) Broker Restrictions

**IT IS CRITICAL TO NOTE THIS**[INTERVIEW](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/interactive-brokers-restricted-gamestop-trading-to-protect-the-market-says-chairman-peterffy.html)**:**  This chairman of IBKR, one of the brokers said this: ""We are concerned about the ability of the market and the clearing systems, through the onslaught of orders, to continue to provide liquidity. And we are concerned about the financial viability of intermediaries and the clearing houses"". In other words, there were so many shares of GME traded that it seems they were having **TROUBLE TO FIND THE SHARES and/or THE CASH TO BACKUP TRADES**. He also talked about how he ""saw this squeeze going to infinity and so they stopped it to prevent losses"". So brokers began to call margins on margin accounts, liquidating stock and options, sometimes very conveniently at the lowest price of a dip. E-toro ""accidentally"" set automatic stop-limits. Robinhood restricted buying to one share, etc. etc. All of which led to a drying up of the BUY side of the books, allowing the SELL side to push price down far more easily than normal.

# 4) Media Manipulation

It has become blatantly apparent that the news media is generally ignorant of the situation, whether willfully or not. From articles about the ""short squeeze"" in NOK or BB (neither of which is significantly shorted), to an endless litany of articles about how ""reddit"" or the ""reddit army"" has moved to Silver despite only a single post in the sub about it, or Biotech, etc. The silver one is my favorite because EVERYONE reported that...but it was practically absent from this sub. Smells really fishy.

Ever since Wed, Jan 13th, the media has been reporting that ""the short squeeze has happened.""

The best examples, in my opinion, is if you watch the ""new"" articles after doing a Google search of ""GME."" You'll find that in general, whenever GME starts to rise, there are suddenly ""new"" (not actually new but updated so that they look like they came out just now) articles bashing on Gamestop, retail traders, the ""frenzy"", WSB, or speculation in general. (my personal opinion, based on what I've seen)

# 5) Bot accounts

There's been a massive influx in this sub of [bot accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafh4d/in_case_you_needed_proof_that_there_are_imposters/) that seem to generally be negative on the GME situation.

&#x200B;

These are a general summary of the reasons that people feel like it's still worth holding GME.

If the news article writers tried harder to find the truth (please, DM me, I'll help), instead of blatantly making things up (re: Silver squeeze, NOK squeeze, BB squeeze, other ""next targets of Reddit"", Qanon comparisons, etc);

if Citadel (a market maker) didn't give a loan to Melvin (a huge GME shorter);

if Citron research hadn't tweeted on Jan 19th that they would discuss reasons for shorting GME (**the next day**) just as GME dipped suddenly during a rise (and then postponed it because they forgot about the inauguration)...and proceeded to give REALLY unconvincing reasons.

if people didn't see evidence of attempted stock manipulation in this subreddit by new accounts;

if the price movements weren't extremely suspect and rapid;

if there wasn't constant reporting about ""shorts have definitely already covered"" for weeks;

if we hadn't seen hundreds of articles about how WSB traders could never understand the fundamentals (while I've seen more fundamentals in the DDs here than in any news article about GME);

**if brokers almost across the board hadn't SUDDENLY restricted the ability for retail investors to BUY but not SELL shares and/or options**;

if institutional ownership wasn't over 100%, and shorters hadn't been so greedy as to short up to 138% of float (it's lower now, but it's still **insanely** high imo);

**and finally IF there wasn't a convincing turn-around story and evidence of it;**

**Then people (including myself) wouldn't be holding. This is my summary of what I feel are the pertinent points relating to GME atm. Feel free to buy, sell, hold the stock as you see fit, this is not financial advice.**

For those who do not know what BlockBuster (BLIAQ) is, BlockBuster (BLIAQ) used be a nationally recognized chain that marketed itself as a video and game rental store. BlockBuster (BLIAQ)s used to be everywhere. A BlockBuster (BLIAQ) on one side of the town, another BlockBuster (BLIAQ) on the other side of the town. At their height of BlockBuster (BLIAQ), BlockBuster (BLIAQ) had an annual revenue of $5.9 billion. That’s a lot of BlockBusters (BLIAQ)!

Many are unaware that BlockBuster (BLIAQ) is still around! Currently headquarters in Bend Oregon, BlockBuster (BLIAQ) is able to stay profitable by selling BlockBuster (BLIAQ) T shirts, BlockBuster (BLIAQ) cups, BlockBuster (BLIAQ) videos, and much more BlockBuster (BLIAQ) merchandise.

I believe that millennials and even Generation Y are beginning to spend money on items that they once loved as a child. This means going into a BlockBuster (BLIAQ), renting 4-5 videos and games from BlockBuster (BLIAQ), and experience the BlockBuster (BLIAQ) smell all over again. It’s BlockBuster (BLIAQ) tastic!

At the moment BlockBuster's (BLIAQ) revenue tops at 1 million with only 50% in debt. They’re looking to expand their BlockBuster (BLIAQ) footprint within the United States by BlockBustering (BLIAQ) the BlockBuster (BLIAQ)s.

This BlockBuster (BLIAQ) is a long term hold. Theirs’s no saying when BlockBuster (BLIAQ) will BlockBuster (BLIAQ), but I believe BlockBuster (BLIAQ) is going to be the new BlockBuster (BLIAQ)!

I am basing this statement loosely on Chewy valuation which is around 43b (I know they are different companies but hear me out). 

First of all. Brick and mortar is dead so the turn to e-commerce is a move away from sudden death and a great growing opportunity, and with the help of talented individuals (Cohen, Amazon dude and such) they can really do this right.

Both Chewy and GameStop have (had) Cohen on the board and are operating in a growing market catering to a specific kind of customer (with games/e-sports being just as big or perhaps even bigger than pets). 

People like to be catered to by others that know what they're talking about, which is a growing trend. Remember, Amazon also sells pet products, however, Chewy found a niche and targets these customers directly with their own specific product.

Would you like bread from an official bakery using the best products or would you like prepackaged bread from the factory? The prepackaged food will do fine, but the bread from the bakery is just better. This same analogy can be applied to Amazon v GameStop. Chewy has proven this argument right.

This, together with the recognizable name, is why I see this trading at around $400 (in a few months/years) which would give it a valuation of around 30b.

Member when $GME squeezed?  I do.  There was some gamma stuff in there, and some short covering, the price went up over 20x, it was *fucking crazy.*

[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/tzNXdnn.png).

That was then, this is now, here's what we know:

* Wall street is rigged
* The buy pressure momentum got castrated mid climax 
* The shorts shorting at $10 probably got out at a loss, new shorts probably entered in the upper ranges and made bank
* The cost to all short holders is significantly depressed at the current market price. [Cheap shorts are available](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME).
* If there was a day of reckoning when shorts all had to buy-in at once it would certainly be ugly, the numbers don't lie, there are a lot of shares short out there that may be impossible to cover
* The only way for a buy-in to happen is upward momentum caused by buy-pressure
* Unless you guys have a bottomless money pit or major market participants enter that's probably not going to happen
* No matter how much you shame each other and throw away your life savings there is no guarantee that the price spikes again

While everyone has been out there ripping call options on all the COVID Vaccine stocks, I believe I've found the real winner of COVID.

Let me introduce you to Molecular Partners AG ($MLLCF on the OTC Markets), I like this stock a lot.

# Who they are:

Swiss biotech company who created an antibody cocktail similar to Regeneron's COVID treatment.

# Why they are the next 10 bagger:

COVID won't been a global pandemic forever, but it's going to be around forever. Much like there are many seasonal flus, there will continue to be many seasonal COVID variants. This makes treatment more of a reoccurring source of revenue than a vaccine.

And MLLCF's COVID treatment is the only which is not dosed via IV (like Regeneron's). **Which makes it the only COVID treatment that you can get in 5 minutes at any doctor office.** It was also recently reported to be just as effective versus all variants of COVID that have/can emerge.

# Why I felt this was important enough to bold:

90% of COVID patients never go to the hospital, meaning all current treatments miss the vast majority of the addressable market, and MLLCF will be the only available treatment for millions of people worldwide.

# Why I'm posting this now:

After reporting promising data at a recent healthcare conference, they release earnings on Friday 2/5. And even better, their phase 1 data is due out any day now (Q1'21 forecasted release).

# Why I'm in the stock:

I was first introduced to the trade by hearing ""Scientist, Virologist, Healthcare investor / Hedge fund Manager""

Michael Taylor (@biotequity on Twitter, he's been spot on with a lot of calls throughout all of COVID) discuss it back in July. Here's what's happened in the name between then and now:

&#x200B;

* Last summer, MLLCF did a secondary offering and their stock shot up 20%, the opposite reaction we see when companies usually issue more equity. The stock reacted this way as they only did the secondary offering after being approached by investors who wanted a bigger stake in the company, and afterwards, big players felt they hadn't bought enough, so bought much more.
* REGN's clinical data can be interpreted very positively for MLLCF's likely future success, as the treatments are based on similar antibody cocktails.
* NVS signed a partnership agreement with MLLCF back in October. NVS bought 45M of MLLCF stock, gave them 22M upfront, allowed them to keep a 22% royalty on future sales, and embedded a 165M option if trials are successful.
   * All in all, that's nearly a 250M deal for a company that had a 300M market cap earlier in 2020.

&#x200B;

# Looking at valuation:

Comparable companies without data are trading at a 3B-5B market cap, implying more than 5x potential upside in MLLCF. ***To quote Michael Taylor, ""I don't understand how it's not a 5x""***

This is not investing advice, just some info on a stock that I like a lot. Mark Cuban suggested we do some deep research, so here it is.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

MLLCF will have the only COVID treatment you don't need to be in the hospital for, and 90% of COVID patients don't go to the hospital.

Novartis signed a partnership deal with them back in October that was nearly worth the same as their entire market cap at the time.

Their treatment was recently announced to be effective against all variants of COVID, official phase 1 clinical data is coming any day, and they report earnings on Friday 2/5.

If the trials are successful, which looks promising due to similarities to REGN's and others, this stock looks like it could go from 25 to 100+ based on comparable company valuations.

**You don't even need to buy options (nor can you), and the stock may have 5x-10x potential this year.**

The company is Atlas Air (AAWW).  This article is an earnings play on a strong company that is not in mainstream media. If you wanna get straight to the point, just go to the end of this write up. 

Atlas Air Worldwide is a leader in global airfreight, that serves freight, commercial, charter, and military customers. If you ever had an iPhone or PlayStation 3-5, or watched a San Diego Chargers game you've probably been impacted by Atlas Air. They have a combination of an efficient fleet, cost-saving operations, and superior customer service. With nearly 3,600 employees working across 90 countries, Atlas Air generated 2019 net sales of $2.74 billion.

They provide ACMI (Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, and Insurance), whereby they provide outsourced cargo and passenger aircraft operating solutions, including the provision of an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance, while customers assume fuel, demand and price risk. In addition, customers are generally responsible for landing, navigation and most other operational fees and costs;.

&#x200B;

[Flying our tendies as you read this](https://preview.redd.it/2couglpv6hf61.png?width=450&format=png&auto=webp&s=cddd29a8ec3d6c527bbfc8ec8b32226525a58251)

The company recently strengthened and diversified its business and fleet with a focus on serving express and e-commerce, which has positioned it well to handle the increased demand in online orders and the future distribution of vaccines.  In the third quarter, management saw strong demand for their long-haul wide-body services. The company anticipates solid volumes in the fourth quarter, driven by continued e-commerce growth. They recently made a deal with Alibaba (BABA) to send their consumer's merchandise to South America and allowing them to grow operations there.

The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 7.69. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.53. Their biggest competitor is Air Transport Services group (ATSG) who even though has a bigger market cap, higher P/E ratio of 15.97, also happens to have a smaller fleet then Atlas Air and does not have the 747-800 which is the newest model of the 747 and most fuel efficient while carrying more weight which in this industry is crucial and helps them stand out from their competitors.

They just bought 4 more 747s to add to their fleet. 

A resistance level has formed in the chart of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc.  If this level is crossed, a breakout could occur and has been at the same levels since November.

AAWW saw strong earnings and revenue growth in the third quarter with earnings up 667.6% year over year and revenue up 24.9%. The stock is trading at a low valuation with a Price to Sales ratio of 0.5 and a Price to Book ratio of 0.7.

The company’s cash position for the third quarter was $718 million, up from $72 million in the same quarter last year. Though that is considerably lower than its long-term debt of $2.4 Billion. AAWW has shown strong long-term momentum, but is down over the short-term.

**There are multiple catalysts that could cause this stock to break out.**

The first one is the fact that the company is being apart of the vaccine distribution and is expected for the next year to help distribute the vaccine because their aircraft can support and hold the refrigerators to carry the vaccines since they have to be kept cold.

Second catalyst. Atlas Air has a partnership with amazon where amazon leases their fleet to transport all their shit all over the world. With the epidemic and amazon growing like crazy this has only lead Atlas Air to grow. Amazon has warrants to buy up to 23% of the company by end of 2023. And its Christmas and I have a feeling Christmas records for Amazon are about to be shattered which means Atlas Air will be busy. Also typically around Christmas through February is the company's busiest time of the year even without

Third catalyst. Growth. Atlas Air is adding to its fleet (Just bought 4 more 747s) and is hiring more pilots to tackle the tasks at hand. Also passenger airlines typically when doing international trips hold additional cargo in their hull to make more profits, but with less international flights due to Covid Atlas Air has had growth in customers asking them to hull freight. And assuming Atlas Air does good with these customers and makes them happy their clientele should expect to grow.

Forth catalyst. Gasoline is pretty cheap, even though it is rising in price with vaccine news, it is still much cheaper then previously before for aircraft.

Fifth Catalyst maybe? As the coronavirus chaos is beginning to come to an end and super sexy overvalued tech companies are no longer as attractive this can lead to an emphasis on value and funds will be longer for their next growth prospects and this provides opportunity for value and growth and a way to capitalize off the coronavirus vaccine, amazon holiday season, and a ever changing world.

Sixth catalyst if you go into long term calls....every time there is a war Atlas air booms because the military hires them to fly out to the middle east and shit is stirring up in the Middle East right now.

**Passenger Airlines are responsible for 40% of air freight before covid...imagine what the earnings report will look like after this busy holiday season.** 

To summarize, this is a well ran growing company and the stock price is poised for a breakout with a combination of these catalysts. The company is no where near its all time high yet it is the best it has ever been financially. The company is also owned over 90% by institutional investors so there is lots of smart money in the company who recognize value and the next earnings report is this month on the 18th and this company tends to have a run up towards earnings.

Literally Can't go tits up. 🚀🚀✈️✈️🌚🌚

First of all, fuck the suits and GME 💎🙌🍌🦍💎🙌🍌🦍💎🙌🍌🦍💎🙌🍌🦍 I have 3 shares at $300 and I just want to see all the short sellers get burned. But for a core position, Ford isn't bad.

**It's a value stock**. Ford is extremely cheap. From 2008 onwards, and again in 2020, Ford has a company that has been left to die. It is also an industrial, which puts it in the realm of boring companies that will benefit from the rotation of it does come.

If you want to talk fundamentals, PE is something around 8x right now, which makes it in the same realm of freaking Tyson Foods, which last I checked, was responsible for taking things off a carcass, putting it into small bags and selling it for 79c/lb for autismos to REEEEEEEEE over.

If you want to talk options, dude the underlying is basically $10. That makes options cheaper. And the IV is basically 30-50% on reasonable strikes and exps (say 10% OTM 1mo, 20% OTM 2mo etc). This means for a single GME option (I don't care which one), you can have anywhere from 100-500 of F ones. People dumping their entire life savings on 20c options is what the sub was built on.

**Gubmit money**. This is nothing new ([meaning we saw it during the Obama era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_incentives_for_plug-in_electric_vehicles#United_States)). You bet there will be incentives for both companies and consumers in the September budget. This also has the tailwinds of Biden's ""plan"" of buying all American and electric for the Federal fleet. Ford will absolutely lowball the shit out of everyone else because that's what Ford does when faced with these [morally-questionable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto), [profit-enhancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_and_Ford_tire_controversy) situations. Ford these past few weeks have been trading like a green company like Sunrun and a few others. Yes GM will probably do the same thing, but GM doesn't have this next point which changes the situation.

**So what if it can become a tech company?** Yeah, it's never going to happen. I would never buy a phone from Ford for example because you know Ford can find a way to make the plastic rust. But the [Ford-Google dea](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/ford-and-google-sign-six-year-deal-for-android-in-car-apps-cloud.html)l goes beyond just installing android on cars. Ford will absolutely sell user information to Google (kinda like how RH sells it to Citadel). Google wants this information because it wants to get into the self-driving car business, and the deal allows it to leapfrog TSLA by not having to build their own cars, network and ecosystem. The data is probably more valuable since you have a wider view of the entire US driving demographic.

GM does not have this. GM does not have anyone to prostitute their driver data to. Sure, GM can do that, but GM is expensive and their small cars business will be absolutely killed by the deluge of new small EV manufacturers over the years.

So... don't do anything crazy like $15c March 2021 because there will be no GME-esque short squeeze (even though yeah VW was a car company and earnings are this afternoon). A 40% gain over 11 months is very reasonable. And again, the options are very cheap ($1.50).

**Risks, disclaimers etc etc:** Hi Mr. SEC, this is not financial advice. I do not drive a Ford because I don't want to be stranded on the side of the road. Apple car might lead to a drop in Ford but thankfully in the US, Ford has stopped producing small cars. If I lose it all, please feel free to find this post again and drop an F in the chat."|2021-02-04 10:40:49.755973|../output/raw/2021/02/04/DueDiligence_flair_DD_104052.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['EV', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'PE', 'I', 'EEEEE', 'IV', 'OTM', 'OTM', 'GME', 'I', 'F', 'GM', 'GM', 'I', 'RH', 'TSLA', 'US', 'GM', 'GM', 'GM', 'GM', 'EV', 'VW', 'A', 'SEC', 'I', 'I', 'US', 'I', 'F']|['GME', 'GME', 'F', 'GM', 'GM', 'RH', 'TSLA', 'GM', 'GM', 'GM', 'GM', 'F']

What is the CBOE? **They are the ones who own your options contracts** and get their sweet sweet 65 cents, no matter the direction. VIX? Yep, they own that too. With option volume overtaking share volume for the very first time in history just one month ago, you would think the monopoly on equity and VIX options would have made new ATHs. 

**It hasn't.** Instead, it's sputtered about and is still 30$ off its 52 week high. Where this gets interesting are the excerpts from the CBOE January 2021 statistics: 

1) Cboe Global Markets' four options exchanges set a new single-day volume record on  January 27, with 18.5 million contracts traded.

2) Cboe Volatility Index® options (VIX®) was more than 662,000 contracts, up 34 percent from  January 2020 , and up 68 percent from  December 2020.

3)ADV on each of Cboe's four options exchanges increased compared to a year ago: Cboe Options up 28 percent, Cboe BZX up 85 percent, Cboe EDGX up 82 percent and Cboe C2 up 52 percent. ADV across each of the exchanges also rose compared to  December 2020.

Premiums for calls just 2-3% OTM for tomorrow's earnings are less than 0.40 a contract. Keep in mind that returning to its 52 week high would be a 25%+ jump. Load up on this sleepy goldmine boys.

I’d say all of his picks are good options. 

However, after digging deeper. I’m balls deep in IDEX, which is currently trading around $4.5 and has increased over 100% this year already.

My fav research article about the stock is here: [https://insiderfinancial.com/why-idex-is-set-to-run-like-solo/180712/](https://insiderfinancial.com/why-idex-is-set-to-run-like-solo/180712/) This is what most of the DD below is from. I have more links to articles and videos if you apes want some. 

**TIL:** IDEX has a market cap of just $286 million. The company just acquired Timios, which posted $8 million in revenue for October and $60 million YTD. We see IDEX as significantly undervalued, especially when you compare IDEX to other EV players like SOLO and NKLA. With over 10% of the float short, we are expecting an epic short squeeze. 

THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. THIS IS NOT A PUMP AND DUMP. I LIKE THE STOCK.

Ideanomics is a global company that facilitates the adoption of commercial electric vehicles and supports next-generation financial services and fintech products. Its electric vehicle division, Mobile Energy Global (MEG), provides group purchasing discounts on commercial electric vehicles, EV batteries, and electricity, as well as financing and charging solutions.

Ideanomics Capital provides fintech services that include intelligent and innovative solutions powered by AI and blockchain. Together, MEG and Ideanomics Capital provides its global customers and partners with more efficient solutions for a greener economy.

**TECHNICAL ANALYSIS**

The Ideanomics Inc. stock holds buy signals from both short and long-term moving averages giving a positive forecast for the stock.

**MEDICI MOTOR WORKS**

The company’s Medici Motor Works division is set to unveil 6 new electric vehicles next month. For anyone in NIKOLA, they should instead be invested in IDEX with its $286 million market cap instead of Nikola’s $10 billion market cap.

## MOBILE ENERGY GLOBAL (MEG)

For the period starting October 1, 2020, through October 31, 2020, MEG delivered a total of 102 units, all of which were taxi/ride-hailing vehicles. The 340 units that were invoiced during July through September 2020 are still pending expected delivery.

During the month of October, China had two major national holidays overlap, which resulted in fewer business days. As a result, it was expected to be a lower delivery volume month.

Q4 is where the company will shine. We are expecting big sales numbers for November and December.

## IDEX INVESTS IN SOLETRAC

IDEX first acquired 15% of California-based Soletrac in October. Solectrac develops, assembles, and distributes 100% battery-powered electric tractors—an alternative to diesel tractors—for agriculture and utility operations. Through a follow-on investment of an additional $1.3M, Ideanomics increased its stake in California-based Solectrac thereby taking total ownership to 24%

## TREELETRIK

Ideanomics owns 51% of Treeletrik, a Malaysian-based EV manufacturer whose business is primarily in logistic vans, mopeds, and scooters. As the China EV market matures, its manufacturers will face oversupply issues. This is where Treeletrik comes in.

## DEX BUYS TIMIOS

IDEX just acquired 100% of privately held Timios Holdings Corp. in an all-cash deal. Timios currently has 285 employees and operations in 44 states and has booked over $60 million in YTD revenues, including over $8 million in October 2020.

A strategic acquisition, Timios becomes one of the cornerstones of Ideanomics Capital, delivering innovative fintech solutions to the U.S. real estate industry.

## S2F2C

Ideanomics utilizes an S2F2C “Sales to Financing to Charging” Model: Sales – facilitating group purchasing by offering fleet operators discounts on large unit orders. Financing – helping fleet operators secure financing to purchase EVs.

Ideanomics will benefit from increased charging (electricity) demand from commercial and passenger EVs – more EVs equals more potential consumers requiring its clean electricity charging solutions.

The [transition](https://www.irena.org/energytransition) to cleaner and more efficient transportation is a global imperative. This trend cannot be stopped and it will propel Ideanomics stock higher. [California](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/23/climate/california-ban-gas-cars.html) announced that it will ban the sale of all new gas-powered cars in 2035.

(Did I mention they invested in wireless car chargers)

## SPAC

We see IDEX taking one or more of its EV divisions public via IPO or SPAC. This makes a lot of sense as there are two divisions – electric vehicles and fintech. At current levels, both divisions are tremendously undervalued.

This is no financial advice. Please do your own DD. I Almost failed out of law school for writing my exams in crayon.

Warm regards,

Waterboy

5. **Price Target & Positions -** what you fuckers probably skip towards, but I demand you at least look at the numbers a little

&#x200B;

1. **Most recent earnings report - 2/4/2021 Q4 2020**

[http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/04/2169706/0/en/Himax-Technologies-Inc-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results-Provides-First-Quarter-2021-Guidance.html](http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/04/2169706/0/en/Himax-Technologies-Inc-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results-Provides-First-Quarter-2021-Guidance.html)

**Revenue:** $275.8 million (**all-time high🚀**) - +14.9% QoQ

**Gross Margin:** 31.2% (**all-time high🚀**) - up from 22.3%

**EPS:** .20 (all-time high is .23 from 2007) - up from .05

&#x200B;

2.  **Q1 2021 Guidance**

**Revenue**: +5%-10% QoQ; --> **$289.6 - $303.4 estimated revenue**

**Gross Margin:** 37%-38%

**EPS:** .30 - .34 --> would be an all-time high

&#x200B;

3. **Thoughts on Earnings**

* Balance sheet looks good
* Three consistent quarters of growth, including an all-time high for revenue & gross margin for Q4 2020 was hit. If you don't think this company is growing and moving in a positive way, go fuk yourself back to your stocks that are worth $4B in market cap with $11 million in quarterly revenue.
* **Guidance for Q1 2021 is huge, IMO**. The expectation of hitting another all-time high for Revenue, Gross Margin, and a first time since 2007 for EPS is huge.

&#x200B;

4.  **Things to know about**

* Himax tldr; what they sell is display drivers and other semiconductor products. Basically, parts for phones, laptops, monitors, tvs, and automobiles.
* Expected to gain market share in automotive driver IC. Himax was up about 32.4% QoQ for revenue in this area. This category is one of the biggest drivers towards gross margin and profitability. **Growth in this category was constrained by foundry shortage. HOWEVER:**
   * Himax engaged early and has succeeded in securing more capacity for 2021 as compared to the level of Q4 2020 when the Company reached the recent peak quarterly shipment. **Total capacity expected to furthermore, increase quarter by quarter in 2021.**
* Himax WiseEye solution expected to start mass product towards the end of 2021. Aimed at NB, TV, and air conditioner applications. For key component business, other than Google, Company further partnered with SparkFun and Edge Impulse.

&#x200B;

**5. Price Target & Positions**

**My Price Targets for Q1 2021**

Q1 2021 (May)

$13.5 - conservative

$15 - tendies if u lucky bitch

&#x200B;

**What I consider reasonable call positions to take up:**

6/18c $13sp

9/17c $14sp

1/20/23c $20sp

**Price excluded because it changes, make sure you check IV (probably should be around 80%) & bid-ask spread, as well as last sale price.**

According to Schumer this is a top priority of congress. With a majority in the house and the senate plus the White House this is almost a sure thing to pass. This would be extremely popular with the citizens and would most certainly help democrats gain more popularity and keep their majorities safe on elections. They have full incentive and ability to do this. When this happens weed stocks are going to explode. 

There is no real timeframe on this however I found one [quote](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/schumer-urges-marijuana-reform-in-meeting-with-ag-pick-garland-and-other-doj-nominees/) that states “In the early part of this year, we will release a unified discussion draft on comprehensive reform to ensure restorative justice, protect public health and implement responsible taxes and regulations.” I would recommend buying as much stock as you can, buying more on dips, and going long on options.

Maybe not on here, but on other social media platforms this is definitely true. I want to take my best shot at an unbiased outlook on GME.
As many of you know, the short interest report is released next Tuesday. When it's released, we will see either one of 2 things:

- Short interest will still be unreasonably high, sinking bloombergs news article claiming short interest was at 33% [This article had no basis for this claim, but I imagine some people may have fallen for it], and we may very well see the squeeze 2.0.
- Short Interest will have dropped below 80%, possibly causing a panic sell-off, even if people claim that Melvin are messing with the numbers

Personally, I think we'll see short interest above 100% still, but until next Tuesday, all we can do is speculate. Until then, I don't think GMEs done, but people are doing a very good job of shitting on Gamestop."|2021-02-04 19:28:23.651516|../output/raw/2021/02/04/DueDiligence_flair_DD_192826.csv|DueDiligence|['I']|[]|['GME', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'GME']

What are 2 things that distinguish our generation? (Gen Z and Y). First, that we are retarded, obviously, but also that we are extremely autistic.

Ok, but on a serious note now, we stand out for first, liking and contributing to hype things. We like flash content, we binge-watch series, we love new things, we love change, we can´t last more than 2 years in a job, we are in movement.

Second, we get bored easily, it goes hand in hand with the first point but when stuff lasts too long or has no hype or movement, we leave it, move on.

That is exactly what the hedgies are counting on. What do you think they did the whole weekend while we were eating crayons and buying fucking billboards all over the world? They made a plan, they hired psychologists, historians, even fucking zoologists to figure out what to do with us.

Some say short ladder attacks are fake, others say the opposite, some say they had to buy the $320 ITM options that expired Friday but didn't others say they did, what the fuck ever man. We know what the strategy is and we always knew, JUST FUCKING HOLD.

They count on you getting bored, they count on you expecting easy money and leaving empty-handed, they count on you to YOLO money you actually need cause if this shit lasts 1 month everyone will be selling cause they have to pay their bills.

A real revolution is not about hype, it's about conviction, a real revolution is not about winning, its about change. We knew we were taking the Hedgies money, just that some of us lost their ground and thought we would bankrupt institutions with trillions of dollars in just 5 days, Diamond Hands are not people who buy and hold during volatile moments, Diamond hands are those who know what they are doing, know what they are up against, and are not in for easy money. Why do we admire DFV, cause he turned 50k to 40M? Probably, but mainly because he saw this shit coming from a year ago and he has been Diamond Handing this shit all the way through.

At the end of the day this all started because we believe in GME, we believed in Ryan Cohen, and we believe in each other.  Rome wasn't built on a day and Wall Street for sure won´t fall in one. But if we focus and not get bored for a fucking change the Hedgies will come begging for our shares sooner or later.

I´m all in on this shit and I won't sell, maybe ill buy more if the stock goes under 20 bucks or something like that. But at the end of the day, they are still short, they are still paying interest, GME is actually improving as a company and this revolution is still on the move. Don´t let your guard down.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Focus, they want us to get bored, to leave and let the hype define our decisions, we know the fundamentals, we know the math, and we know our DD. This could last a week, a month, or a year, but DFV held, so can you. This is your chance to invest in that stock that ""would have made you rich if you invested x amount x time ago"" this is that chance, don´t waste it. HOLD and all good things will arrive in due time.

However, let me re-introduce you to a real stock: **AMD**. 🚀🚀

At $88 a share, we’re looking at massive upside. And instead of buying GME at $83, why not buy something that actually has some long term value? Oh and did I mention it’s one of the most shorted stocks this month? [https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/most-shorted-stocks](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/most-shorted-stocks)

**That’s $6.7 billion in short interest.** That’s larger than the actual current market cap of GME. Let’s actually make a dent here. These fuckers **added 17% more shorted shares** in the last month. You're gonna tell me their diamond hands are better than OUR DIAMOND HANDS 💎💎💎?

As our savior Elon Tweeted today : “I am become meme, destroyer of shorts.”

[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357269755112148993](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357269755112148993)

Let’s make him proud.

Ok, now for some DD so you guys know I’m not talking out of my ass.

# Fundamentals:

Their latest ER:

**Crossed $3 billion in sales threshold for the first time, INCREASING YOY by 52%**

**Full year sales of $9.76 billion**

Server revenue doubled year over year which is absolutely incredible because that means they are actually going toe to toe with the big boys like IBM.

Massive increase in guidance. They’re **expecting 37% growth** this year.

So why did they drop from their ER? Well, it was because of next-gen chip shortages through the first half of 2021. But let’s be real here, this is a joke compared to the issues Intel is facing with their next-gen.

Obviously, we’d prefer if they never had a shortage, but I mean if you’re gonna have a problem it might as well be this one. This news is LITERALLY SAYING, “hey we have too many orders and we can’t keep up sorry, we’ll get it to you ASAP”

Imagine thinking this company isn’t going to bounce back and go to new ATH in the next month or two.

Our queen, Lisa Su, said “there will be added capacity” in the second half of the year. This is perfect, because that means by the time next holiday season comes around they’ll be good to go. I wouldn’t worry about these shortages. They are running at full capacity and we should expect their sales to increase throughout the year.

**Some loser (**u/aatop**) decided to call out Market Share issues in my last post so here's a section just for him:**

Intel gained back 0.7% of market share in Q4 across the CPU market as a whole. Whoop de doo!

**In the last month ALONE, AMD gained back 3%.** Here's a little business lesson. Ups and downs happen. No growth company is going to have growth every single month/quarter. I don't care who they are. There are hiccups. Don't let some negative nancys make you believe that a hiccup means AMD's market growth is ending.

**AMD actually GAINED on Intel in the CPU server secto**r. What does that tell you? That **boomers are actually converting to AMD** for their company. And we all know that these boomer companies have all the money for now.

# Technicals:

For those of you who care about lines on a chart, I got you as well.

We really have two things to look out for. We have a resistance (that used to be a strong support) at 88. But we’re basically there right now.

In addition, the last few weeks before ER, we were in that 89-97 channel. What does that mean? Well, once we get going here **AMD will shoot up to $97 and from there we can retest ATH.**

&#x200B;

For more squiggly lines, the MACD is about to cross the signal line so we could see some bullish sentiment here. And of course the RSI is near the bottom of the range, but honestly who cares about that anyway.

# Conclusion/TLDR:

My point is that more than half of you fuckers run AMD in your machine anyway and the other half is waiting for their stimulus check to buy the new Ryzen series. The new investors here are all sad from GME, but now it’s time to put your big boy pants on and get into something that has some real value behind it. You got questions? Leave em in the comments and I’ll answer.

DD for a company I believe in and you should too. 

Pure Cycle Technologies is about to ipo in a merger with $ROCH and has the ability to be one of the big boys in the chemical and recycling market. Reasons listed below. 

1. Patented technology to recycle polypropylene into virgin plastic pellets. I’ve researched this and their process has little to no byproducts other than water and co2. Patent was developed by proctor and gambil. Bunch of ex P&G guys founded the company. Their tech has been listed by Time and a few chemical and recycling publications as one of the top inventions of 2019.

- The squeeze has not been squoze, and the HF's are still on the hook for their shorts.
- The HF's have closed their positions, and we're all holding the bag.

You all know why you should hold if the squeeze has yet to be squozed, so I'm going to focus on the other possibility and why holding is still the best move in that situation.

If the HFs truly covered their positions on the 26/27th, they lost billions. We see this with Melvin coming out and saying they lost billions, and billionaires saying they are just trying to make a living etc. The stock also started to skyrocket on the 29th until the buying restriction were put in place. This skyrocket is very likely due to the hype and people all jumping on board, and the HF's are the only people who know whether their shorts were covered. If the shorts *were* covered, then shorting again at $300/$400 per share is the obvious move to try and make back the billions they just lost. They won't make the same mistake by shorting over 100%, and seeing their ~50% numbers kind of makes sense. They are betting that ~50% or more will sell once they see the stock plummet. If this is the case and you sell now, you are literally bailing out the HFs on their bad short position earlier in the year.

Borrowing and selling a ton of shares at $400 will drive the price down, which is what we saw directly after the buying restrictions were set up. If this is the case, they likely sold all of their borrowed stocks at high prices and it levelled out on Tuesday/Wednesday. Today, Thursday, we are seeing the success of FUD campaigns being and people getting scared and selling off with their losses. 

If we all hold out and set our sell limits to $500/share, we all make a huge profit and we fuck their short positions *again*. If you sell now, you are accepting your loss and bailing out the HF.

These new short positions they are holding at $300/$400 per share probably won't be forced to recall until sometime in March, which means this *could* be a long hold-out.

All of that said, with GME's new management, all the hype, attention, and money they've made, the company is a *good* bet. I think it is likely to be a ~$300/share company within the next 2-3 years, so holding onto your shares is *still* a good long-term plan.

So the following holds true:

- Either the positions from last week still need to be covered, and a second squeeze is coming in the next week or so.

- New shorts are in place, and we can hold for a second squeeze next month

- Long-term you will likely get your money back, it just might take a few years. It's better that it sits and slowly recovers value than to just accept the loss and bail out the HF.

Selling now is just a bad idea all-around. I know it seems dark, but the loss is only a loss if you sell.

If we rally right now, buy the dip, and hold strong, we can force another squeeze. We *know* they have at least some short positions in the $300/$400 range, let's not let them get away with it. Buy now and put in a $500 minimum sell point. Either you catch the squeeze that's coming in the next week, or you catch the squeeze that's coming in the next month. Either way, a bit of patience is key and we fuck the HFs for their blatant market manipulation.

TL;DR - Hold onto your butts! Selling is a bad choice."|2021-02-04 19:28:23.651516|../output/raw/2021/02/04/DueDiligence_flair_DD_192826.csv|DueDiligence|['GME']|['GME']|['GME', 'FUD', 'HF', 'I', 'HF', 'I', 'DR']|['GME']

* Tilray’s EU campus is well positioned to capitalize on the demand trend in the EU and in other international markets and we will monitor how quarterly numbers reflect the increasing demand on a going forward basis.

For a quick DD, let's compare their stats pre-pandemic and today:

**Pre-pandemic:** in January 2020, AMC traded around $7/share, and had a market cap of $700M.  19Q3 revenues were $1.3B.

**Now:** in January 2021 just before the recent runup, AMC traded around $2.5/share, and had a market cap of $400M, accounting for the successive share dilutions.  20Q3 revenues were $0.12B.

Their revenues fell 90% Y/Y, they have massive debt of over $5B, they've diluted their shares, and their cash flow is horrid.  Even if they ever get revenues back to pre-pandemic levels (which may take years, and they still have to make their debt payments), ***they'd be worth only $4-5 because of the dilution***, assuming the market will pay the same multiple as pre-pandemic.

It’s a little EV company called Stellantis (STLA). Stellantis is an EV manufacturing corporation with deals with companies such as FCA and Peugeot. It just recently opened for public trading on the market. They plan to have 39 different EVs made by 2022. 

What makes this pick so great in my opinion is, of course, Joe Biden. Not just Biden being there, however. Joe Biden has announced plans to convert the entire federal fleet into EVs. What company does the federal government use for the most part? Dodge, *which is owned by FCA*. With Stellantis very likely producing these EVs, we could see a very healthy surge in the company’s value. 

Pretty short DD, I know, but I think this has the potential to be a great long term pick.

Listen up retards, I’m not the best at explaining so please bare with me. 

All this noise about Nokia when Ericcson is outperforming them makes 0 sense. Ericcson is cucking Nokia so hard that positive news about Ericcson raised buy ratings on Nokia.

[Nokia upped to buy after Ericsson results - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nokia-upped-to-buy-after-ericsson-results-2021-02-01)

Ericcson has had some strong performance year over year due to 5G contracts and has actually somehow came out of last week better than it went in (currently $13.15 at my time of writing this).

Full disclosure, I own calls (for the 19th of both months) and stonks. Despite strength in the price action, it seems to have a ton of suits rooting against it. Looking on Marketbeat we can see a massive volume of short interest shares. UP 22% on a biweekly period on the closing months of last year alone!

[ERIC Short Interest Ratio (Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (publ)) (marketbeat.com)](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ERIC/short-interest/)

On my platform if I check options pricing, it seems a lot of the pressure is pushing from the top down into the $11 area, which I personally don’t understand given the success and amount of contracts they have been signing in the past week alone.

This post is for those of you who are new and asking about why people are still holding in this stock. It represents my personal opinion, often backed up by facts, but also including theorizing. This is all in addition to the original DD+updates, which can be viewed here:

# 1) Institutional Ownership of GME is over 100% of the float.

Blah blah blah, what's the big deal? Well consider this for a moment. If we assume that these institutional shares are essentially not in daily play (not exactly true because some of them are shares held for smaller accounts or whatever, but ignore that because diamond hands probably hold an equivalent amount to that portion), and we go ahead and assume that those institutional shares cannot be bought to cover a short (which they can but not easily/not quickly)...then:

EVERY SINGLE SHARE TRADED ON THE MARKET IS A SHORTED SHARE THAT IS OWED TO SOMEBODY.

That's right, every single share traded on the market is ACTUALLY AN IOU. That's INSANE. And for every share we (as retail investors) buy, that's an ADDITIONAL IOU.

I literally can't overstate how insane this is. This isn't just a short squeeze where there aren't enough shares....there are literally LESS THAN ZERO UN-SHORTED SHARES TRADED. This goes so far beyond a liquidity issue, I honestly don't know how clearing houses are even functionally capable of obtaining GME shares anymore. This thing will explode soon, because every share bought is just compounding IOUs at this point (on avg, obviously).

Forget the moon....🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 to some kind of permanent orbit.

# 2) Price movement during the meteoric rises

On Monday, Jan 25th, we had some huge spikes but only slightly positive movement. On Tuesday Jan 26th, price slowly climbed at an almost perfect line. This, I believe, was some shorts carefully, slowly covering and/or retail buying excitedly and/or a gamma squeeze due to the unexpected situation where every call from the Friday before ended up being ITM. Then between Tuesday and Wednesday, price **SHOT up afterhours from $150/share to $350/share**. Bloomberg had an interesting article regarding how approx. only $45m was needed for this price movement. On Wednesday, Jan 27th, the stock essentially traded sideways, with some big volatility. Then on Thursday, Jan 28th, many brokers suddenly restricted the ability to buy GME and the price fell sharply, but then rose again with additional movement after hours (likely MM's covering the newly ITM calls before Friday, perhaps some shorts covering). On Friday, Jan 29th, a twitter account belonging to one ""Kjetill Stjerne"" who may or may not be a reclusive Viking billionaire, tweeted that they would ""hold the line"" in light of the brokers closing and posted a bash script with a piece including something like ""hunt=shortsells"". While nobody can confirm if this is true (though he was for sure someone early on the GME boat, we don't know if he's actually wealthy, etc), all of us who watched the Level II Data stream on Friday saw that many of the ladder attacks (aka, rapid share dumps and/or shorts, below ask price and sometimes below bid price) were suddenly stopped when compared to previous days, and the stock, while very volatile, closed at $325 (essentially, sideways movement again, but with huge spikes/dips) leaving lots of call options ITM.

After Friday, the stock dropped starting Monday. It closed Monday at 225, and Tuesday at 90. I believe this was due partially to people selling (and panic selling), but also due to people shorting. It's important to note that volume was HIGHEST DURING the Friday before last, and then last Mon/Tue. Once the stock rose above $325, volume stayed relatively low and dropped until Tuesday.

What does all this mean? My opinion is that the spike was artificial. Someone intentionally raised the price using afterhours movements (why? I can hand-wave and give some options...but it's all speculation), and opinion of the stock was high enough to sustain that high price for a little while. Once that was evident, brokers across the board suddenly restricted the ability to buy shares (not just Robinhood), likely due to increased clearinghouse requirements, thus locking out retail investors. I personally also believe the Viking was legit, and he's the reason the price stayed up on Friday in the absence of retail buying, but that's my personal opinion. Which brings us to discuss the broker restrictions:

# 3) Broker Restrictions

**IT IS CRITICAL TO NOTE THIS**[INTERVIEW](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/interactive-brokers-restricted-gamestop-trading-to-protect-the-market-says-chairman-peterffy.html)**:**  This chairman of IBKR, one of the brokers said this: ""We are concerned about the ability of the market and the clearing systems, through the onslaught of orders, to continue to provide liquidity. And we are concerned about the financial viability of intermediaries and the clearing houses"". In other words, there were so many shares of GME traded that it seems they were having **TROUBLE TO FIND THE SHARES and/or THE CASH TO BACKUP TRADES**. He also talked about how he ""saw this squeeze going to infinity and so they stopped it to prevent losses"". So brokers began to call margins on margin accounts, liquidating stock and options, sometimes very conveniently at the lowest price of a dip. E-toro ""accidentally"" set automatic stop-limits. Robinhood restricted buying to one share, etc. etc. All of which led to a drying up of the BUY side of the books, allowing the SELL side to push price down far more easily than normal.

# 4) Media Manipulation

It has become blatantly apparent that the news media is generally ignorant of the situation, whether willfully or not. From articles about the ""short squeeze"" in NOK or BB (neither of which is significantly shorted), to an endless litany of articles about how ""reddit"" or the ""reddit army"" has moved to Silver despite only a single post in the sub about it, or Biotech, etc. The silver one is my favorite because EVERYONE reported that...but it was practically absent from this sub. Smells really fishy.

Ever since Wed, Jan 13th, the media has been reporting that ""the short squeeze has happened.""

The best examples, in my opinion, is if you watch the ""new"" articles after doing a Google search of ""GME."" You'll find that in general, whenever GME starts to rise, there are suddenly ""new"" (not actually new but updated so that they look like they came out just now) articles bashing on Gamestop, retail traders, the ""frenzy"", WSB, or speculation in general. (my personal opinion, based on what I've seen)

# 5) Bot accounts

There's been a massive influx in this sub of [bot accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafh4d/in_case_you_needed_proof_that_there_are_imposters/) that seem to generally be negative on the GME situation.

&#x200B;

These are a general summary of the reasons that people feel like it's still worth holding GME.

If the news article writers tried harder to find the truth (please, DM me, I'll help), instead of blatantly making things up (re: Silver squeeze, NOK squeeze, BB squeeze, other ""next targets of Reddit"", Qanon comparisons, etc);

if Citadel (a market maker) didn't give a loan to Melvin (a huge GME shorter);

if Citron research hadn't tweeted on Jan 19th that they would discuss reasons for shorting GME (**the next day**) just as GME dipped suddenly during a rise (and then postponed it because they forgot about the inauguration)...and proceeded to give REALLY unconvincing reasons.

if people didn't see evidence of attempted stock manipulation in this subreddit by new accounts;

if the price movements weren't extremely suspect and rapid;

if there wasn't constant reporting about ""shorts have definitely already covered"" for weeks;

if we hadn't seen hundreds of articles about how WSB traders could never understand the fundamentals (while I've seen more fundamentals in the DDs here than in any news article about GME);

Edit: if the GME and AMC graphs hadn't been paralleling each other for a week;

**if brokers almost across the board hadn't SUDDENLY restricted the ability for retail investors to BUY but not SELL shares and/or options**;

if institutional ownership wasn't over 100%, and shorters hadn't been so greedy as to short up to 138% of float (it's lower now, but it's still **insanely** high imo);

**and finally IF there wasn't a convincing turn-around story and evidence of it;**

**Then people (including myself) wouldn't be holding. This is my summary of what I feel are the pertinent points relating to GME atm. Feel free to buy, sell, hold the stock as you see fit, this is not financial advice.**

So what's the play?  $CVAC, currently trading at around $111.50 a share, with a market cap of 19.71B.  They're in phase 3 trials of their covid vaccine right now and have been signing deals left and right, such as:

I'm expecting phase 3 trial results from them early next month, mostly based on this, which has the trial set to conclude on March 4th or 5th:

[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04652102](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04652102)

This is earlier than I expected, due to the trials being initiated on December 22nd to my knowledge, but maybe it's accurate?  Anyways, if any of you have followed Novavax ($NVAX), their stock price went to the moon a few days ago when they announced that their vaccine worked, and I'm anticipating a similar large move in $CVAC if their vaccine works.  From what I've read about their phase 1 and 2 results, and seeing large deals being signed each week now for distribution, I'm expecting phase 3 results to show that the vaccine works.

Now there is a counterargument to this, mainly that they already have a higher market cap than $NVAX, will be able to produce less of their vaccine, and their vaccine will have most likely have lower efficacy than $NVAX: [https://twitter.com/MedResCol/status/1355489429150986240](https://twitter.com/MedResCol/status/1355489429150986240).  Also obviously their vaccine might not work, but I don't think this is likely.

However, I am of the belief that they will exceed these delivery numbers and may engage in more partnerships to produce their vaccine candidate once it is proven to be effective.

Additionally, DADDY MUSK is in their corner, with Tesla having partnered with CureVac to develop mRNA printers capable of printing multiple different vaccines: [https://electrek.co/2020/07/03/tesla-joint-patent-curevac-revolutionary-bioreactor-for-rna/](https://electrek.co/2020/07/03/tesla-joint-patent-curevac-revolutionary-bioreactor-for-rna/)

When their phase 3 trial results are published and they shoot up like $NVAX printing tendies for all you're gonna be salty you didn't get in on that sweet action.

Positions: I hold calls for March 21 as well as shares, if you wanna be safer with guessing when their phase 3 results will be out maybe go for April 21 calls.  I'm poor so I don't have that many calls or shares, and I also lose money a lot so maybe this DD sucks.  If the SEC is watching, this is not financial advice, just my retarded DD

TLDR: Vaccine printer go BRRRR when they announce their vaccine candidate phase 3 trial was successful, likely early next month."|2021-02-04 19:28:23.651516|../output/raw/2021/02/04/DueDiligence_flair_DD_192826.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['$GME', 'I', 'DD', '$CVAC', 'B', 'I', '$CVAC', '$NVAX', 'I', 'I', 'DADDY', 'MUSK', 'RNA', '$NVAX', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'DD', 'SEC', 'DD', 'BRRRR']|['GME', 'NVAX', 'NVAX']

The Low-Down:

Workhorse ($WKHS) is an EV commercial truck manufacturer primed to moon. They're one of the finalists for the $6 billion USPS contract to replace the old, outdated postal trucks with shiny, new, sexy trucks. This contract was supposed to be awarded in December but got delayed. We can expect the results within the next month.

The two other finalists are Karsan, a truck manufacturer from TURKEY and OshKosh/Ford who are putting up an ICE truck (but have said they could pivot to an EV if required).

Now, the contract itself isn't for an EV truck however adding fuel to the fire (acid to the battery?) in support of WKHS is that Biden wants the entire federal fleet to be zero emission. This is great news.

Also, WKHS is based in Ohio, American made and a union company. If your pecker isn't half chubbed and saluting at those words, then honestly you're a pinko commie un-Murrican bastard. And you can bet your ass that is being factored into the decision as to who to award. You really think that they're going to give this money to the Turks? No, this administration knows it has to pay at least lip service to American manufacturing and union support. And honestly, as Americans, that's shit that we should be supporting, too.

Their debt is around 70 million right now, which pales in comparison to the money they'll be getting if (when) they get the USPS contract.

EDIT: Oh yeah, and their short interest (SI) is around 27%, which you idiots who got spoiled @ >100% may scoff at, but is still pretty high in the normal world.

TL;DR - Don't be an idiot and sleep and WKHS. It's a great long-term play but I also believe it has potential for healthy short term gains.

EDIT 2: To put forth the other argument for why the OshKosh/Ford truck could beat out WKHS, so you see the other side of the argument: both OshKosh and Ford already have their tenterhooks in the government and definitely could win the contract. Also, as an astute person pointed out: the USPS currently doesn't have the infrastructure to support a full EV fleet, meaning that OshKosh/Ford's offering may be an easier transition. 

However, I don't think these necessarily weaken WKHS's position at all. Granted, I could be putting WAY too much stock in a cynical/political POV with this, but the way that I see it is that the contract is going to be 'weaponized' to be about more than just replacing the aged USPS fleet and will instead be something to tout as a green victory for the administration. Which I believe is overall a great step in the right direction and something we all should be happy about but let's be honest: decision makers understand optics and a PR release that says ""USPS moving their entire fleet to 0 emissions"" will play a lot better than ""USPS adopts new truck. Plans to move to 0 emissions by 2030"""|2021-02-04 19:28:23.651516|../output/raw/2021/02/04/DueDiligence_flair_DD_192826.csv|DueDiligence|['WKHS']|[]|['I', 'EV', 'USPS', 'URKEY', 'ICE', 'EV', 'EV', 'WKHS', 'WKHS', 'USPS', 'DR', 'WKHS', 'I', 'EDIT', 'WKHS', 'USPS', 'EV', 'I', 'I', 'WAY', 'POV', 'I', 'USPS', 'I', 'PR', 'USPS', 'USPS']|[]

Its not the intrinsic value before the shorts and the DFV info was $30 now with all the free advertising, New board and ""goodwill"" the realistic intrinsic value has to be raised to $35-40. Back of my hand numbers but you get the point.

I don't care what you bought at. The current price is $70, so your down side is $30 a share. However if the short information is correct (and we will see on the updated numbers fairly soon) there WILL be another gamma squeeze so the price is likely going to hit the highs we saw last week again so $450+. We can also have the upside of the short squeeze, which can go way higher.

So there is literally no point paper handing at this point. All you are doing is making gamma and short squeezes less likely. The upside (390 on a gamma way more on a short squeeze) vs downside (30 now) is massively in our favour! So even if you think there is 10% chance of it happening its a good bet. 

DFV and all the apes (which I am one) knows this and is still holding, I trust him more than some bots! If anything the bots just show how desperate the hedge funds are, Think about it, if they had covered why would they care whats happening now.

There’s always the exact same number of buys and sells and it’s easier to move the price on low volume. Half the shares outstanding are held by you dipshits. The volume is low so its easier to fuck with the price. But the price doesnt actually matter.  
  
“What do you mean the price doesnt matter? how dumb are you?”.  
  
What matters is that Melvin still has to buy more shares than there ever are on the order book. Volume is low so eventually they’ll be forced to fill every sell order no matter the price. You buy it for 50$ now and place a sell order at 50K$, Melvin has to buy it for 50K$ at some point.  
Let me make this clear:  
EVENTUALLY MELVIN HAS TO FILL EVERY SELL ORDER NO MATTER THE PRICE.  
They HAVE to. It’s not a choice. There’s not enough volume for them not to. There’s not enough stock in circulation for them not to.  
  
That’s the trick. You aren’t waiting for the “price go up” you’re waiting for Melvin to buy, which they have to, meanwhile you never have to sell. It’s like a staring contest where you get to keep your eyes closed while you opponent has to keep them open. Melvin has to blink, you can keep your eyes closed for longer.

Looking at the VW chart people keep floating around it's hard to tell the day to day scale but what people don't seem to notice is that VW is that after jumping up $398 the price tanked hard to $210 right before the squeeze. BUT! That was 8 straight days of losses before the squeeze happened (Oct 16th - 24th).

When the price started to rise it didn't hit its peak until another few days and it stayed there for a few days (Oct 27 - 31).

I know this isn't exactly like the VW squeeze and there are different variables at play but the timeframes still lend to my point... This shit takes time! Everyone expecting this all to happen without any ups and downs need to chill the fuck out. This is just as stressful to everyone but you beautiful bastards are holding the line!

Congratulations, you're slightly less retarded than half this sub and probably belong at /r/investing . You're already balls deep on calls/stock pickups, the price went down this morning after a positive earnings beat, and you think you're holding a loser.

Chill the fuck out.

**$NOK$** prior to 2021-01-22 was trading FAIRLY flat for the last year with price averages between **$3.30** & **$4.60** (With some larger swings). What happened? Hype. Price shot up to $9.79, share buying was blocked, and paper hands took their tendies and ran.

So you're sitting here holding stock that's worth less than half of what you paid for it. What now? Dilute your shares and buy the dip. We've seen heavy support at the **$4.30** price target today and price swings up from this point. Set your limit order at this price and buy as much as you can afford. Is this proof you have a gambling problem? Probably.

Will the price ever go back up? Of course it will. Price targets for this stock are fairly consistently above current market price. While the entire market is retarded, you can't beat good fundamentals/[earnings beats](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nokia-nok-q4-earnings-revenues-151303550.html)/[market positioning](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nokia-nok-secures-key-deals-145002461.html)/[new technology](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/27/nokia-and-elisa-push-network-boundaries-with-worlds-first-1t-deployment/). Current consensus prices (from the conservative banks) put price target at **$5**, you'll make money even in the worst case. [Majority of firms prior to March 2020 doomsday held price targets between $7-$6 on the stock.](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/NOK/price-target/) This is **a rough 50% lift** from current prices.

**TLDR:**  

* Pick up **$NOK$** cheap on the dips (my re-entry has been at the $4.30 support point but pre-hype prices **~$4.20**)  

* Dilute your holdings if you're underwater (just keep pumping in money)

This device is being developed in a phase 2/3 clinical trial now.

Essentially this device using low voltage to open your skin pores, so that the vaccine made be placed in the lipid (fat) portion of your skin. This allows for more direct placement of drug and more efficiency for immunization. 

If any of you were in the military prior to 2005, you would remember a device most commonly known as the ""jet injection"" gun. Essentially using pneumatic air to open the skin pores. The amounts of injections and immunization increased exponentially with the invention and use of this device. The reduction of plastics and needles was great too. Unfortunately, in Mid-2005 the Veterans Affairs put a stop to the devices, stating possible cross contamination exposure. Well, duh, in those days in the military they never would sanitize after each injection. I believe this CELLECTRA device from INO is going to be a revolutionary new method of immunization delivery. 

The other big reason this company is unvalued in my opinion. Inovio has been doing their research and discovery without the help of Big BioTech firms. They are the only independent biotech company I have found with a Covid-19 vaccine without the oversight or partnership of the big tech.

Happy Hunting.

Do you noobs really think that's how markets work? 
You think funds and pro traders make money by holding on to their underwater positions forever?
Better quit your job and start a hedge fund that will always be up with its bags full of memes.

Here's the only question you need to be asking yourself about any of your positions:

**Would I buy this stock right now, at the current price?**

If the answer is anything except a strong YES, sell. 

If you don't understand this very basic idea of investing 101, you need to get out of the market immediately and get back to your job at Wendy's.

Nobody in the market wins 100% of the time.
Winners win by maximizing gains and minimizing losses.

What can we do if were tapped out of money and stuck with a big ole bag of 300.00 plus? Hold. Try to figure out how to acquire more shares. Get a 100 and sell covered calls to lower DCA (dollar cost average, smoothies). 

Here's the thing I'm not worried one bit about, GME. Am I worried the squeeze was squoze and we tried to squeeze more then was available to squoze? Yes. Cause quite honestly none of us had a fucking clue what the peak may have been or could still be.

The end game for me was even after all the dust settled I think with Cohen on board and the moves they've already made GME has a bright future. Maybe not 300 a share bright but they will be a valuable company. That was DeepValues sentiment as well.  The squeeze was just a possible bonus. Stop panicking figure out an approach that best benefits you and still the potential for a squeeze. 

100 shares @ 65.00 never selling unless they get assigned and I refuse to have a lower strike then 150.00. If assigned I'll buy again and rinse and repeat.

Like many of you, I was looking forward to the short squeeze as I bought into AMC the night before Robinhood restricted shares and we didn't ride the rocket to the moon together. I thought some of you may need some reassurance if the squeeze doesn't happen today, tomorrow, next week, or even in two weeks. I tried to piece all the information I could together in as logical of a manner as I could and feel free to correct me where you think I'm wrong or add onto my thoughts.

After I read through the Elon Musk tweet thread where he autistically said, ""I am become meme, Destroyer of shorts"" I realized that TSLA was probably diamond handed by a bunch of you apes and I wanted to confirm so I did some browsing and came upon this article. ( https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1mzy62nf393lw/The-Longest-Unprofitable-Short-I-ve-Ever-Seen ). I realized that TESLA in no way, shape, or form should ever be a stock worth over  $800 dollars because their revenue per year is only 20 billion and they produce 500,000 cars with a market cap of  $800 billion per year compared to say Toyota who posts revenue of 272 billion and yet have a market cap of a measly $185.4 billion. It is simply the result of a company that is performing well and is still squeezing shorts to this very day. 

Short selling is when a share is borrowed at market price (at whatever time it was borrowed) so they can sell the share at that price, and then cover the borrowed share when the price of the stock decreases so they can profit the difference. If we were to look at the chart of AMC's (the stock I'm diamond handing) Hedge funds must have short sold it at no lower than  $4 dollars because since the beginning of 2020, the stock had ""peaks of around  $7.50 in Feb 2020,  $6.50 in June 2020, and  $4.30 in Nov 2020. In order to capitalize of short selling, they would try to buy in at the highest price possible in order to profit the most when they anticipate COVID would crash the price of AMC and potentially attack AMC enough to bankrupt them. Unfortunately, we love AMC. We've enjoyed movies since our childhoods at AMC theaters, had our first dates there, enjoyed time with friends and family bonding together in AMCs. The support of this community and many others willing to keep AMC afloat through this tumultuous COVID crisis kept AMC alive and their stock price MUCH higher than intended for the short sellers. The only website that shows me short interest from 2/3/2021 is ( https://www.thestreet.com/investing/top-stocks-being-shorted-by-short-interest-gamestop-gogo ) and GME and AMC's short interest are both very high. If you guys have more data I'd love to see it. 

Unfortunately right now with the SEC investigation of DFV, social media, and message boards such as WSB. Our interest in GME and AMC as an undervalued stock can't be shared as heavily with others because its thought of as market manipulation. After the investigation clears and DFV can return, and perhaps more public figures can come in such as Mark Cuban, Elon Musk, Chamath Palihapitiya, we can spread our DD for these companies that we know are highly undervalued.


Simply put, if we hold our shares, and AMC re-opens and starts to reflect its true value as a 15-16 dollar stock. The squeeze will occur from the shorts and they either can exit their position or they will continue to try to short and just keep running up their tab. In the end if shorts get squeezed, its just a transfer of capital from one to the next because a hedge fund bet on a company failing. 

tl;dr I like the stock and my hands are diamonds until I die

= = =

For those of you who feel as if you were left holding the bag on GME or AMC or whatever, do know that **as long as you hold onto these shares at LEAST 30+ days (give it 35 from the most recent just to be safe imo) you can write up to $3000 of capital loss off in your taxes next year.**

Anything after $3000 can be carried over to the year after.

So it is not a total loss and many people will eventually see their money back and this should probably ease quite a bit of the stress a lot of you are feeling from this ordeal.

The people who are in real trouble are the ones who are out tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, but this should at least take the sting out.

I would also like to state that there were warnings everywhere about not putting in more than you were willing to lose and the whole ""Sir, this is a casino"" thing was only a half-joke"". It's just like Vegas and we all took a risk and many of us got burned as a result.

I'm a bag holder for $GME to the tune of $1700 average cost basis at 10 shares. Got excited and bought a two shares in the 200s and two in the 300s; but it was all money I was willing to live without if this didn't work out.

This additionally gives you further incentive to hold on for awhile and see how this whole thing plays out and how the subreddit situation falls. I'm going to continue to hold because of this. I've got nothing but time and who knows, maybe it will go back up and see a second surge and you'll be able to get out with at least minimal financial damage and take it as a lesson learned.

EDIT: /u/gallow_bob was kind enough to correct my limited understanding on the situation and replied with the following in my original comment.

>	To clarify--you can reduce your income by up to $3000 a year for stock losses. I didn't realize the 30 day hold thing but that is very good advice. That doesn't lower your taxes by $3k--it lowers your taxable income by $3k--so depending on your tax bracket it will lower your taxes by $300 to ~$1k.

>	If you have over $3k of losses you can roll that forward into the following years./u/

I see a lot of people looking at the AMC chart and thinking they are limited on their downside because it was worth about the same before the pandemic happened. One factor nobody is really talking about is the fact that the number of shares outstanding has quadrupled since then to keep them out of bankruptcy.

So even with lower interest rates and the pandemic clearing up, the stock would have to be valued at 4x the amount to have the current stock price. I know the squeeze is what is keeping the price where it is, but just making sure everybody knows their is more downside that could become realized.

I am also aware that they just paid 600 million dollars in debt but they are still in ~$5 bln in debt so no better than pre-pandemic.

AMP945 is a Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) inhibitor.  From my understanding, the FAK will be used to break the barrier of fibrotic tumors in cancers (pancreatic and ovarian) which currently are difficult to treat resulting in a high mortality rate. The result they are expecting is to break down the fibrotic tissue surrounding these types of tumors resulting in more successful treatments.  In Phase 2 trials, Amplia intends to trial their FAK on ovarian and pancreatic tumors as well as other fibrotic diseases.

What a ride this has been man. Crazy to see how much this sub has grown in popularity and all the attention it's gotten. I myself was interviewed by the Wall Street Journal. Keep fighting the good fight everyone.

NOK has been on my radar and a lot of other people's radars for many reasons. The biggest one being their transition from a cellphone manufacturer to a cell service provider, trying to get into the 5G space. That's the main reason they had a little bit of a pop in recent days, I myself had $7 calls that went up 300%

This bull run was fueled by investor excitement over their transition into 5G. They still have a ways to go to really get their footing into the market as the 5G space is super competitive right now but if they play their cards right they could easily back into the mainstream and have a bright future ahead of them. They recently beat their earnings expectation and have had a strong 2020. 

Challenges do remain. Like I said before, they're going up against some huge competition in the 5G space with the likes of Samsung, Huawei, ZTE, etc. They're also handcuffed to CSPs who posses significant pricing power (According to Morningstar)

Despite these challenges,  I think of Nokia as a good buy at it's current price ($4.36 per share at the time I'm writing.) I don't believe their 5G abilities have been priced into the stock, simply because there is a long road ahead for them. 2021 will be a challenging year as Nokia tries to get their foot into the door but if they can weather the storm it can be a good payday for those who bought into their vision early on. Investor sentiment suggests investors are confident that they will pull this out. Today's put/call ratio stands at .14 which is extremely bullish. At a current price of $4.36 per share, there isn't too much to lose here if the worst case scenario plays out.

Positions: None, I'm taking a little bit of time to just enjoy life and not have to worry about the markets. I'm enjoying life and on the side I'll be posting some research on WSB here and now since finance is my passion."|2021-02-04 19:28:23.651516|../output/raw/2021/02/04/DueDiligence_flair_DD_192826.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'NOK', 'G', 'I', 'G', 'G', 'I', 'G', 'ZTE', 'I', 'I', 'G', 'WSB']|['NOK']

I honestly do not think they understand how the healthcare payment system works. This seems like an obvious attack on Chamath for his criticism of short sellers recently and support of us retards

1. The DOJ investigation is doomed from the start. Kickbacks are hard to prove and can be structured in many legal forms

2. Operating at a loss is the norm for disruptive companies and the fact they plan to be profitable by 2023 is impressive.

3. Criticizing Clover for sales tactics that mislead the elderly is just laughable. Having a company you own help patients with insurance choices is the least deceptive thing insurance companies do. You may as well dissolve the AARP (please do) for screwing seniors for decades

4. Clover was fined by CMS for misleading tactics, but CMS fines companies CONSTANTLY. CVS/Caremark/Aetna is caught defrauding the government every year but they just get a slap on the wrist.

5. The assertion that Clover mislead patients about services shows just how little Hindenburg understands our healthcare payment system. Insurance companies promise coverage to patients in regards to tier based copays and networks that they CONSTANTLY change

6. Seek Medicare, as I mentioned before, is no different than Geico giving you quotes from multiple insurance companies. This is nothing compared to CVS/Caremark/Aetna sharing patient data to steer them toward conglomerate owned services.

7. Going after Clover for marketing their software as a driver of sales because they use a marketing and sales team is just lazy.

8. Removing your name and ownership of companies for compliance reasons is incredibly common. So your company uses a company you know and trust? Big deal. No one will care about this when they let conglomerates go with a pinky promise that they won't share data

9. You are allowed to give out gifts to offices. A certain amount is allowed per year.

10. They are seriously attacking insurance for upcoding like it is something new. They all do it, intentionally or unintentionally. It is easily passed off on a mistake when they are audited. This is not groundbreaking information

11. If the software is easy for people to use, it is improving patient care. And guess what, ALL HEALTHCARE SOFTWARE IS DESIGNED FOR CODING PURPOSES

12. You want it to be difficult to do things like remove diagnoses in your software. It is intentional to prevent you from making a mistake. All software has tedious crap to make sure we don't unintentionally delete something important

13. Paying physicians more is always going to delight them. Using a criminally underpaying system like medicare as a baseline just shows how little Hindenburg understands

14. Getting physicians to adopt new software is HARD. They seriously retire or quit over stuff like that. Adoption rate will be slow, so the fact that those who have adopted are using the software 98% of the time is a big deal

15. If you were to call 100 doctors offices, 99 would complain about the software. Providers HATE software. Insurance companies require more and more paperwork every year and the software that helps with that is always criticized.

16. Hindenburg is calling member growth lump and sporadic while failing to understand that signing up for Medicare only happens at certain times in the year. There is a reason there is a spike every year and slow down.

17. The rest is just a personal attack on Garipalli

This was by far the laziest and ignorant short report I have ever read. Hindenburg research needs to understand the industry it is talking about before publishing this kind of crap. This was so bad, it encouraged me to grab $CLOV calls for the obvious rebound

Hello diamond-hands, paper hands, bag holders and squeeze-awaiters.

Many of you are probably hurting right now, and are likely (rightfully) angry at RH for restricting buys and killing the momentum. Some of you think this was an effort by them and their HF buddies to kill the squeeze. Some of you are angry enough right now to move your account, or have done so already. But some of you will let that anger fade and will stay at comfortable, familiar RH. I'm here to tell you that:

# EVEN IF RH DIDN'T CONSPIRE TO KILL THE SQUEEZE (AND I DON'T THINK THEY DID), YOU SHOULD STILL MOVE YOUR MONEY!!!

By RH's own admission, they did not have sufficient capital to maintain the positions of their users without implementing buy restrictions. That means that if there is ever another scenario like this, or God forbid a 2008-style meltdown, RH could either restrict again, ban buying altogether, or even go tits-up and leave their customers' money in limbo for God knows how long. It also means that ***behind the easy interface and easier access to leverage, there is a financial institution that lacks the infrastructure to support its customers.*** 

***CONSIDERING THE ABOVE - MOVE YOUR MONEY. REVIEW THEM APPROPRIATELY ON APP STORES. AND DON'T LET THEM REEL YOU BACK IN.***"|2021-02-04 19:28:23.651516|../output/raw/2021/02/04/DueDiligence_flair_DD_192828.csv|DueDiligence|['LEAVE', 'RH', 'A']|['RH']|['DR', 'RH', 'RH', 'HF', 'RH', 'EVEN', 'IF', 'RH', 'T', 'SPIRE', 'TO', 'KILL', 'THE', 'UEEZE', 'AND', 'I', 'T', 'THINK', 'THEY', 'YOU', 'HOULD', 'STILL', 'MOVE', 'YOUR', 'MONEY', 'RH', 'ERING', 'THE', 'ABOVE', 'MOVE', 'YOUR', 'MONEY', 'EVIEW', 'THEM', 'ATELY', 'ON', 'APP', 'TORES', 'AND', 'T', 'LET', 'THEM', 'REEL', 'YOU', 'BACK', 'IN']|['RH', 'RH', 'RH', 'RH', 'RH']

Gme did NOT get to its peak at 486 via a short squeeze. We know this because the S3 data that was going around all last week still had the SI at 121% AFTER the price started coming back down from that peak. 

We know that synthetic longs are a thing and don't change the SI but DO change what they get to report as SI. This means next Tuesdays short report might not matter, don't hang your hat on it.

We know deep dips happen before a squeeze in previous short squeezes. I looked at not on vw but also tesla and a bunch of no name penny stocks that have charts in articles about short squeezes and they all repeat this pattern of going up a lot then all the way back down to original prices, then a massive run up with the squeeze about previous peaks.

What we don't know...
We don't know if they actually covered or just did synthetic longs.

We don't know if it is all over.

We don't know, if a squeeze is going to happen later, when that will be. So STOP giving artificial expiration dates and shit like some evangelist trying to predict the end times. You sound like an asshole and you will be wrong every time.

We don't know if we can hold longer than they can stay solvent. But I know I don't have any money i care about in gme so Idgaf.

Prelude:

To those that bought in from my last PLTR post and sold when it hit 45 for 400%, good job. However, if you're a 💎🙌 savant like me, IM NOT FUCKING SELLING. In fact im buying more.

&#x200B;

DD:

* PLTR had an incredible performance at their tech demo. The technology they showed the public was fascinating and just off that i'm hopeful for their future. Jeffries Financial group raised their PT to $30 from $18 and stated that Palantir is ""in a class of its own by tackling problems that no other commercial software company can address.""  
   * This could mean that new deals and catalysts could show up more often in the future
* Some TA rn is that PLTR has major support in the 31.5 region and i believe that  this is the bottom for now. Also it is showing signs of reversal and strength since its sell off from $45

&#x200B;

THE REAL CATALYST!!!!!!

* This is the moment we have all been waiting for. EARNINGS IS COMIN BABY. Feb 16 is the day of earnings, so NOW is the time to buy if you're not in already. I am still a believer that the hype around PLTR earnings will be astronomical, and will result in lots of screaming and gain porn on WSB.

Positions or Ban/Tl;DR:

I am still holding my March 19 $40 calls - up 15% rn

I am adding Feb 19 $40 calls to my position 

I am not holding through earnings because share lock up ends on Feb 19 and EVERYONE will be selling. I will be using this to buy Shares for the long term at the dip

In this post, I'm going to discuss how volume has behaved in relation to price and why the behavior we've seen in GME the past few days is ***incredibly unusual***.

We all suspect that there's heavy market manipulation going on, so I'm just 

It all started when I decided to take a peek at this graph  on the 1-hour timeframe of price with On Balance Volume plotted below it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yk768la97if61.png?width=1258&format=png&auto=webp&s=39df33410c2a9d7540f2f6e8ce2de0dcc5c8eb80

**What is On Balance Volume?**

On Balance Volume (OBV) is a way of cumulatively measuring volume. It adds all volume from periods where the price rose and subtracts all volume from periods where price dropped. 

**What does this mean graph mean, then?**

Remember, OBV shows *cumulative* volume pressure. It doesn't measure the amount of volume that happens over a period of time. Typically, OBV should mirror price pretty closely, but here we see the price plummeting and OBV holding steady near its high moving sideways.

When I saw this, I immediately thought something was off. In market equilibrium roughly 50% of periods the price will rise and 50% of periods the price will fall (Remember whether price increased or decreased is critical to the calculation of OBV) which would make OBV behave as it currently is. In a trending asset, this ratio of green candles to red candles should become skewed, or we could see a higher average volume in green or red candles specifically, and as either of these changes, OBV will increase or decrease.

So since GME is trending down the past few days, we should expect to see a skewed distribution of red to green candles (Which would cause OBV to crash), and I wrote a quick script to measure and confirm this hypothesis:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dfdrl8erfif61.png?width=2607&format=png&auto=webp&s=aae35a0accb33f7152fa9c71f98ab3ebc4a23ba6

This histogram is simple and calculated by: *number of green candles - number of red candles* and it uses data from the past 30 periods (In this case, 30 hours).  The histogram currently shows -8, a ratio of 11:19 or about 63% negative 37% positive, which is what we hypothesized. 

*Phew*, that was a lot. But now that we have everything out on the table we should be able to see where things don't line up...

**There's nearly twice as many red periods as green periods, but OBV hasn't changed.**

So, 19 of the last 30 one-hour periods were subtracted from OBV, and 11 were added, meaning *there must be a huge skew of the amount of volume traded on hours the price is green vs the hours that price is red.* 

Essentially, THE HEDGIES HAVEN'T CLOSED, THEY'RE DOUBLING DOWN.

TL;DR the price is crashing down, and every time buyers flock in to buy at the new low, crazy amounts of shares are sold halting any momentum and causing the price to continue to fall.

“But smart glasses look bad - who would wear them?” Maybe they’re not being used in everyday leisure use just yet, but they have several existing usages in industry 

Other reasons:
- They’re turning a profit now (as of the last quarter)

- Their results are due in March, so good to jump in now before they get pumped in the lead up to/after results 

- They already have several industry contacts

It is important.

When you sell a security (such as GME) at a loss, you can claim that loss on your tax return (it will be subtracted from your capital gains/reduce your taxable income). HOWEVER, if you then buy that security back (or a ""substantially identical"" security) within 30 days before or after, you void any capital losses you had in terms of tax loss harvesting. In other words, you can not use those capital losses to reduce your taxable income and you will just eat the losses.

Thank you for listening and continue retarding. Merry tendies.

I bought in to Bed Bath & Beyond $BBBY during last weeks _Mania_ @$38 for 34 shares, plus a $45 $BBBY Call Option @$380 (not very bright), and 1.45 shares of $GME @$324.

#At its current price Bed Bath & Beyond $BBBY has a long trend value of $33 in 6 months.  The stock is shorted at 65% and the company has already started a stock buy back program. At a price below $30, $BBBY is a good bet - [List of most shorted stock on the market right now]( https://imgur.com/Nm4hsxQ). 

During this Cycle (which I’m starting after the Covid correction in March) $BBBY has had a fairly constant Uptrend that, even after the first January correction, has a trend that still lines up with the troughs on the higher-low line:  [Trend Line for $BBBY since March 2020](https://imgur.com/dhbfPzw)

Bed Bath & Beyond sells home goods and so called ‘smart money’ thinks there is going to be a downturn in home goods when the Covid stuff ends. Buying home goods during the Stay-at-Home orders is what they call *Nesting.* which is why so many of them shorted the stock, but $BBBY will be fine for at least the next 6 months, or even 9 months. We’re not going to be leaving our houses for the next few months anyways, which will continue the *Nesting* trend for another good quarter or two, and it will take investors a few down quarters to start frowning on $BBBY.  So that means current investors are HOLDING. That brings the trend price based on the higher-low line to about $33 in July, 10%+ where the current stock price is at:  [Continued trend line for $BBBY into July 2021](https://imgur.com/ml6swYO)

Plus, Bed Bath and Beyond begas a stock buy back program back in October. The plan has been halted, for obvious reasons, but they’ve [announced to restart buying shares again in March]( https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bed-bath-beyond-bbby-concludes-162704294.html)

If the company is shorted at 64%, but has long growth of 10%, buying $BBBY at under $30 is the best way to take advantage of a potential **Rocketing** short-squeeze that, even if a short-squeeze doesn’t pan out, you probably won’t lose money.

#You might be saying: *Hey retard, you can’t just put a green line on a chart and say it going to work that way.”*

True! But, if we look at the things coming in 2021 on why people would need convenient Home Goods, Bed Bath & Beyond $BBBY is going to have healthy sales figures for the foreseeable future. I’m calling **The Doubles**

##1. DOUBLE THE AMOUNT GATHERINGS AT OTHER PEOPLE’S HOMES IN 2021!
“Hedge Fund” belief is that when the pandemic is over there is going to be a mad desire for larger than life gatherings like Concerts and such. That is true, but there’s going to be long ramp up period for that. However, a year full of missed birthday parties, anniversary parties, retirement parties, youth sport team parties, divorce parties, dessert and campaign parties (these are actually pretty fun. I don’t drink btw, I go for the deserts), cookout for the hell of it parties, etc…  are going to happen at an accelerated Rate in 2021. Did you know Bed Bath & Beyond sells party supplies? I’m not talking about just paper plates and napkins; I’m talking about serving platters, serving utensils, electric food warming trays, beverage tubs, margarita machines, kegerators, bathroom towels, random stuff to make your house look nicer when guests come over… all the stuff someone would want for a party. 

People don’t have time to wait for an online order to show up when they’re preparing for a party, especially if they need those items the day of. So they go to the store to get it when they think about it.


##2. DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF EXTENDED STAYS AT FAMILY AND FRIEND’S HOMES! 
Long distance family and friends haven’t seen each other IN PERSON for a long time and reunions are going to be #1 on peoples travel list. Couch surfing and guest rooms are going to be the top destination for most people in 2021. Smart Money thinks there are a ton people out there with the money spend on Cruises and trips to Disneyland? Hogwash! People are going to be visiting their family “Back Home” or traveling to Boston so their 4-year-old daughter can meet her cousins in person. And the hosts for these guest roomers and couch surfers are going to update their hospitality amenities (such as clean sheets, towels, toothbrush holders). Many of them wont have time to wait for an online delivery; they’re going to need those items NOW. And where will they update guest hospitality items right now? BED BATH AND BEYOND!  

##3. DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF WEDDING REGISTRYS!
All the weddings that got canceled last year are going to happen this year. Plus all the weddings that are supposed to happen this year are also going to happen this year. And do you know what is attached to all those damn Wedding Invitations? A Wedding Registry! And where are all of them registered at? BED BATH & BEYOND! May-August going to be Diamond Hands for them. 

Here’s a great vomit-inducing article about the increase in weddings in 2021 & 2022 because people like links in these DDs: https://www.insider.com/weddings-will-be-more-expensive-after-pandemic-2022-2021-1

##4. DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF STUFF FOR COLLEGE DORM ROOMS!
A ton of new college kids didn’t move into their dorms last year which means double the tonnage of new college kid will be moving in this year. And those college kids are going to need sheets, blankets, pillows, towels, shower caddys, lamps, etc…  And Mom is going to want to shop with their kid to buy that stuff together. Andy where are they going to shop for that? BED BATH & BEYOND

##5. WORK FROM HOME IS HERE TO STAY! 
Sure, you might say people already stocked up home stuff during the lockdown and that buying binge is over. ITS NOT OVER –ITS NOW HERE TO STAY!  And when you get squirrely stuck at home with nothing to do, sometime you go out and buy stuff for your home. Its like: “You know what I need? A new coffeemaker. Lets go get one right now.” Or, “Remember how so and so’s dishes all matched each other, lets go get some matching dishes right now.”  When squirrely hits, you aren’t going to wait around for an online delivery, you’re going to go get it NOW.

##6. IF A SHORT SQUEEZE IS GOING TO HAPPEN ON A STOCK, ITS REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN TO THIS ONE, AND IF IT DOESN’T, YOU’RE STILL IN GOOD SHAPE!
$BBBY is a good stock. The company is liquid, there is a need for their goods, and they offer convenience for immediate purchases. Plus, lots of people and companies already own the stock with no intention of selling.  Its financial stability, firm upward trend, and staying power already have it as a HOLD or LONG by 4 out of 5 reporting agencies, which is what conservative money looks at. 

Oh yea, some Key company factors: 
1)	As per their last report they got $2.2 billion in the bank. They’re Liquid
2)	15 million have downloaded their store app
3)	2.2 million new online customers last year
4)	Other important financials that IDK what they’re about
5)	They dumped all their subsidiaries and now just focus on one thing, Convenient Home Goods!

If you’re new to this sub, you probably don’t know that some people here trade against the WSB hype consensus. They sell when WSB says it can’t go tits up. And they buy when WSB says there’s no money to be made. 

As the red dildos keep growing, WSB is turning their back against GME. Haters are climbing out of their caves left and right. People are saying the run is over. And maybe they’re right? But maybe somewhere in the sweet serenity of -40% red dildos phase 2 is starting to brew. Maybe...

TL;DR 
I’m neutral on GME, but I love to inverse WSB and the cave dwellers have me feeling pretty bullish. I have my eye on shares & late Feb calls. Do your own research and play with what you can afford to lose- this isn’t investment advice.

Although short interest as a % of float is and always has been low for CLOV, I think its important to note with today's short report that although shares shorted outstanding were largely flat 6/30-11/15, there's been some big whales recently shorting $CLOV:

Shares outstanding at each point of time (courtesy of S3):

11/15/2020: 0.629 Million Shares Short

11/30/2020: 0.730 Million Shares Short

12/15/2020: 1.650 Million Shares Short

12/31/2020: 4.321 Million Shares Short

01/15/2021: 9.110 Million Shares Short

It would be interesting to hear from Hindenburg Research when they started offering $CLOV short reports to their clients since they mentioned that they started this research 4 months ago...

I am just a guy who spent 3 hours researching shorts and doing the math on the GME short. If I am being a full blown retard, tell me how and I will adjust my math accordingly.

**TL:DR, Shorts are probably paying about $1 million dollars per day to hold our shares.**

Shorties will have to buy back the stock....but as long as they meet the daily interest payments, they will not be pressured to do so. They pay interest everyday on the stocks that they've borrowed. To calculate how much they have to pay each day, I used the following formula: (Share Price x # of Stocks shorted x Interest)/365. Source for the formula: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-loan-fee.asp#:\~:text=A%20stock%20loan%20fee%2C%20or,hedge%20fund%20or%20retail%20investor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-loan-fee.asp#:~:text=A%20stock%20loan%20fee%2C%20or,hedge%20fund%20or%20retail%20investor)

On Jan 27th the stock was $347. I don't know what the interest rate at the time was, but I will assume 9%. I also assume the shares were shorted 120%.

($347 X 61,236,000 shares short X 9% )/365 = $5,239,452.82.

I apply this formula for the last week and push it out to Feb 27th:

**Assumptions:**

* 120% of the float is still shorted.
* Average price of the GME will be $60 for the near term.
* Interest Rates are 9% for the near term.   [https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)

Positions: 3 GME stock @ $276 and 2 deep OTM weekly calls. Holding because I like this stock. GME has a great potential in the future e-sports and gaming market. And I don't like shorties. Those cheaters can't have my stock. They got fleeced. I hope all of their clients stop doing business with those fools.

The company had an IPO in 2019 at 20.55, but currently trades around $13. The chart over the last year or so has been climbing dutifully, as the company beat it's last ER estimate by 26% and recently announced some new technology called Comfort Sense™ that will make it's aligners better and more comfortable. 

On the downside, the company just today released a new convertible offering that will dilute existing shareholders. Given the trajectory of growth of this company, however, I believe this may present a buying opportunity. 

The trajectory of the company's earnings combined with the growth of telehealth and new technology that the company is investing in make this stock a great growth opportunity in my book.

If you are looking for a YOLO, they are projected to announce earnings at the end of the month. Otherwise, this is a more reliable stock to build back one's portfolio..."|2021-02-04 19:28:23.651516|../output/raw/2021/02/04/DueDiligence_flair_DD_192828.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['CVS', 'HP', 'IPO', 'ER', 'I', 'YOLO']|['CVS', 'HP']

I am going to use **traditional investing fundamentals and ratios, but more specifically,** 

**the ICONIC price to sales ratio.** 

# Calculations

The price to sales is calculated by dividing the share price of a stock by it's sales per year.

A healthy price to sales in this era is around 30.

This can be derived by looking at other technological innovators in the field including TSLA CHWY NKLA PENN and various other companies.

# GME's Price to Sales is emphasizes it as a ""value play""

GME's price to sales it a mere 1.31. That means for every 1.31 dollars in share price, their company has 1 dollar in revenue **an absolute steal.**

I have never seen anything like it. 

# Conclusion

At a generous price to sales ratio (\~30), **GME's valuation is strongly undervalued and the stock represents 2200% upside ($1100 per share)**

&#x200B;

# TLDR:

**GME is fundamentally undervalued and could easily be $1000 per share at traditional valuations.**

None of this is financial advice. I retard.

Firstly, I am still holding GME until at least the end of the month. I'm in it for the history and also I like this stock.

Now, on to **TELL (Tellurian)**. This is an energy play (1.09B mkt cap) that can be molded to fit into any agenda regarding energy.

If the momentum is in clean energy: bullish

If the momentum is away from clean energy: bullish

If there is news about pipelines being closed: bullish

If there is news about pipelines being opened: bullish

It is the centrist energy stock.

**But why tho?**

TELL main business is Liquified Natural Gas (LNG). While not considered ""clean"" energy, it has commonly been considered the cleaner of the ""bad guy"" energies. This was pushed by the Obama admin as a cleaner alternative to coal. But even if we (USA) decide to shift to 100% ""clean"" energy, there will still be demand for other energy sources until we get there (at least 10 years of solid demand).

**What about pipelines?**

The advantage of LNG over regular Natural Gas is that it can fit into tiny containers and DOES NOT need to travel through a pipeline for TELL to deliver it. It can go on trucks/boats/etc. The customers who buy LNG from TELL will be able to decide to keep in LNG form to transport OR they can turn it back into gas and transport through a pipeline. win-win.

**Advantage over competitors?**

Biden wants to appeal to voters and will try to keep energy clean-ish. One way is to not allow land to be leased for natural gas or oil. That is GOOD for TELL, because they own the land on their (wait for it...) new Driftwood Project facility on LAND THEY OWN, NOT LEASE. They are not only increasing supply, but no new competitors would be able to come in unless they already own the land.

**Price Movements?**

TELL took a huge hit with covid. They are international, and it really messed with their logistics and their business deals. TELL was close to closing some deals and was ready to launch from the $7 dollar range to ??? (the moon probably). Those deals fell through with the covid uncertainty. Turned into a penny stock for a while. Now that we are coming back out of that, LNG demand is through the roof (watch the videos on their site [https://www.tellurianinc.com/about-us/](https://www.tellurianinc.com/about-us/)). This thing has already started parabolic movement. I think this is a short and/or long-term play. I had stock during the drop. I doubled down with calls 4/16 $2c about three months ago. I will keep rolling these out until IDK. Total, I have about $10k on this bet. I think we will be at $10 by EOY easy, I wouldn't be surprised to see $15-$20 EOY.

**This is mostly sentiment, what about the fundamentals?**

Fuck You. I'm sure the numbers are there if you look. I'm not going to. The market cares about sentiment and subjective investing right now. Also, look at the fucking chart. This thing going moon. All I know is I put money in the box and more money come out of box. Repeat.

**What else?**

The CEO wears a track suit in his investor updates. Just watch them.

TLDR; Tracksuit wearing CEO has permits to build facility to increase supply to meet increased demand for Liquified Natural Gas (doesn't need pipelines) on our transition to true clean energy. Government regulations expected to eliminate any new competition. Not even close to pre-covid price.

# I just want to preface by providing the source of my data. They will be sourced after each statistic I state.

Alright everyone is freaking out at close today and it must be a scary thing seeing your money drop like that. I want update people on the current facts and clear up some misunderstandings. First of all, short interest rate is key here. The last updated short interest was 44.67M shares as of January 27, 2021 from [shortsqueeze.com](https://shortsqueeze.com).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xpnkiwr57jf61.png?width=410&format=png&auto=webp&s=b731069f9917af34e908cabfba1718c461ac2ec7

From that and the total float is 56.57M shares from [marketwatch.com](https://marketwatch.com). This is gives us a value of 78.96% of total float shorted. Now I feel like a lot of people have been selling because they think that the short interest ratio represents the amount of time that it takes for institutions to cover their short positions. THIS IS FALSE. You can hold a short position forever if you wanted, you just need to pay interest on your principal. So for example if an institution were to short AMC when it was $15, they would be able to keep that position as long as they paid interest on $15 \* # of shares shorted. What we really need to do is have a high price with a HIGH SHORT INTEREST RATIO. Having a high short interest ratio means that institutions have MORE pressure to cover their positions because they will have to pay interest on that amount of time. Keep in mind that short interest is not reported regularly and the next time it is reported will be on market close February 9, 2021 as per [shortsqueeze.com](https://shortsqueeze.com).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lr1nckf67jf61.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=37e418f0d5f8fe25ed258ebc5482a3dff55cb752

If short interest increases, this means that there is still potential to short squeeze and adds pressure for the institutions to cover (days to cover increases as the numerator of the ratio increases).

Hey you guys, making this short, don't have time for you ""insert derogatory term here.""
Came here to update you with 3 important things you should know about ATT.  

&#x200B;

1.  this week guys been loading up T 2/19 30C.  At first it was a few thousand contracts, then 10K yesterday, and then today about 53K, Check the books tomorrow, but looks like those were all added to the 30c existing OI at 40K, tomorrow opening 80K+ OI.   Find the other legs if you think I'm wrong.  50K at closing bid .12 = 500K +
2. T is a solid company, they showed in ER, they are not a decliner no matter how Buffett pumps TMUS. HBO Max & Time warner are going to be huge performers for them.  More importantly is that T is consolidating great entertainment IP in all genres and they have the best library of old content to exploit in the future.  HBO Max has some kinks, and they aren't selling it hard to investors, this is sleeper value, which might be a thing sometime.
3. My reason to buy $T for 2021 is unrelated to options activity.  Biden and Dems will payback ATT for all the help CNN provided in winning the election.  I don't know how this will all work, but my best guess is government contracts having to do with fiberoptic internet or 5g, maybe a little backdoor pork with internet in schools.

little words area:

short term high risk

$T 2/19 30C @ .13

short term high risk

$T 2/19 28C @ .86   (.35 premium)

long term pork play medium risk:

$T 1/20/23 20C @ 8.8, you get 3x leverage with same .35 premium, but no dividends, don't buy this unless you like #3 and want to wait out for developing corruption which will take a while to flesh out."|2021-02-04 19:28:23.651516|../output/raw/2021/02/04/DueDiligence_flair_DD_192828.csv|DueDiligence|['$T']|[]|['$T', 'C', 'ATT', 'T', 'C', 'K', 'K', 'OI', 'K', 'OI', 'K', 'K', 'T', 'ER', 'TMUS', 'HBO', 'T', 'IP', 'HBO', '$T', 'ATT', 'CNN', 'I', '$T', 'C', '$T', 'C', '$T', 'C']|['TMUS']

First of all, quarterly dividend doesn't mean it pays every quarter you smooth brained ape. It just differentiates it from other types of dividends, such as yearly, special, etc.

Second, GME hasn't paid a dividend since March 2019. Do yourself a favor and ask your wife's boyfriend to take a break from railing her to teach you how to google ""GME dividend history"" to confirm for yourself.

And finally (since you don't know how to count anyway) twentieth, GME won't start paying dividends again any time soon.

If you stop snacking on crayons for more than 2 seconds and try to put a crease in that ball of teflon you call a brain you might realize this means they're going to need some capital to implement these changes. Companies usually forgo dividends so that they have more money to make these changes and grow the stock price. So no crayon allowance for you.

I know that many of you bought the stock b/c you truly like the company and I honestly believe Ryan Cohen and his new pals will turn the ship around for GameStop, although believe that will take some time.

I will try to keep this brief for all the apes / autists here but even YOLO plays should have some level of reason to them (maybe?).

TLDR version -

1. GME is better positioned for a SS 2.0 but AMC will likely benefit
2. AMC is better fundamentally positioned as the economy re-opens and consumers migrate from video games to getting out and socializing at the movies
3. AMC pre-pandemic was around $6 - $7 supporting the current buy point (although it may go lower as GME drags lower)
4. AMC took advantage of it's rising stock price to eliminate some of its debt
5. Whales believe in it's potential too - Dave Portney bought $700k worth of AMC yesterday

As of 2/4, S3 shows 15.71% shares float short interest against AMC (44.68M out of 284.47M) vs 50.68% of GME (25.86M out of 51.03M float). This isn't public, I had to pay for this.

Short interest is one thing, but lets compare that to daily volume.

The 20 Average Volume is 72.7 M for GME and 289M for AMC. AMC goes through 101.6% of it's float shares a day and GME goes through 142% of it's float across the 20 day average. This makes the short ratio (or days to cover) at 0.356 for GME and 0.155 for AMC which means that if a SS 2.0 were to happen it will more than likely happen for GME as the short positions on AMC could quickly be covered without causing much craziness. However, AMC's swings is heavily correlated to GME - see below.

&#x200B;

[Price Swing Between AMC vs GME across Short Squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/7gdp49o8djf61.png?width=2310&format=png&auto=webp&s=339dab698f0722a62b99e00b334cdd1e3dad88fd)

&#x200B;

While correlation is not causation, it's likely that during a GME SS 2.0, this will greatly impact AMC. Furthermore, the AMC has not crashed as much as GME either having now overtaken it today in the upward direction. As GME continues to slide down amidst restrictions and scrutiny, all of the people that had 10x profit of their investment will began to recognize more and more how heavy 💎🙌 can be causing more sell-off reducing the impact of a SS 2.0 (e.g. if it falls to $30, I don't think SS 2.0 could take it above $90).

I previously wrote a DD about how GME could be fundamentally worth $300, I think that will take quite a bit of time in re-inventing the company whereas AMC will benefit much more quickly than GameStop in the short-term. As the economy re-opens, people will be running away from video games to getting out and going to watch movies. The pre-pandemic price of AMC 2/14/20 was $7.10 which means that at the very least if it goes down by a lot more, it is likely to return to this level as the economy re-opens. In other words, AMC is on discount right now while GME will continue to be on discount for a while and continually increasing it's discount percentage (so you could make profits on AMC and then get GME for an even greater discount than currently).

Long-term, I think AMC will continue to struggle as distribution companies look to release films through streaming platforms but for now as economic restrictions continue to lift and more people feel safer about getting out and about, AMC is primed for vast short-term success. 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Fundamentally, this is safer than holding out for a GME SS 2.0 and still benefits from a GME SS 2.0 as well.

As of Q3 2020, AMC has a debt-to-asset ratio of 121.47% vs GME debt-to-asset ratio of 87.3%. However, AMC didn't start opening up theaters until Aug 20, 2021 which is 50 days closed out of 91 days of the quarter (e.g. they were open for less than half of the quarter) while continuing to pay for benefits to all of its employees. This bleeds through cash like a bullet wound to the aorta. As opposed to GameStop, they were able to open many of it's stores earlier in Q2 with eCommerce growth and continued Q3 debt-to-asset increase. That said, for Q4, many of AMC's theaters were open being able to start earning revenue and not just bleeding money.

Q4's EPS estimate for AMC is -$3.68 EPS vs Q3 -$5.70. I actually believe it won't be as low and could be as high as -$3 EPS. The last year AMC was profitable was 2017 as people spend more time streaming movies than going to the movies, but the forecasted trend is still positive for AMC.

The major weight on a company's ability to overcome obstacles, such as a global pandemic, is having to take on debt. Debt can open lots of opportunities, but if it's a means to survive rather than grow, it really creates a burden. This is where AMC made a great move in my opinion over GME with converting it's debt to shares eliminating $600M worth of debt. While it has diluted the shares (and would have diluted GME shares too) reducing SS potential, it enhances the ability of the company to grow reducing that burden of debt.

Finally, Dave Portney who said he was exiting all the meme stocks has went back into AMC by $700k - [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dave-portnoy-stakes-700k-amc-061244626.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dave-portnoy-stakes-700k-amc-061244626.html).

🚀🚀🚀🚀My price target for AMC is $30 within the year 🚀🚀🚀🚀. It's been there before and with bent-up demand, it has a lot more to gain than hoping for a GME SS 2.0.

AMC is expected to report earnings on 2/25/21.

It's been a fun ride. It's not about the money, it's about holding the fucking line. We can make money from now on, it just takes time. Maybe we go down in finance history books, which would be nice.
🦍🦍🦍 Together strong. 🚀🌕



Most people here lost lots of money, some even tons of money (literally).

Maybe the stock will plummet, idc. I'm staying for the whole ride and will never sell untill $1000 (even if it takes decades and you won't buy but a bread with $1000 due to inflation). 

Fuck money. Money can be made. Trading or otherwise. 

I'm sure if people made so far a thousand or a million, can make at least twice just by taking what they have learned here. 

It will just take some time.

Even with GME. Instead of just pumping, I could just hold and all try help the company itself (more investing over long periods of time, engaging with it more, buy more of its product, help promoting it) so its stock price will go back up (stonks📈).

It just takes, relatively, forever.

It surely sounds absurd, foolish, and retarded, but at this point I will hold the line. I like the stock.

Ar least I'm not a 🧻👐. Maybe we're not 💎🤗 yet, but our time will come.

I'm still 🦍🧠 and I stand by it. I believe in apes together strong slogan. 💪🦍🦍🦍🦍 🏋️


Some people exited the game (maybe join in later). And that's okay. We should have expected it. It's just human dynamics. Humans get bored and scared and just exit. 

So far it was a fun ride. Maybe it will get crazier or just crash, but it will be interesting anyways.

Some guy said that this moment will go down in finance history; maybe he's right. At least I was a part of it.

Oil companies are now trading at a fraction of their former valuations, despite oil beginning to accelerate. Oil will be $80+ by the summer and the super majors will run up 50%+. Options are dirt cheap and unlike the meme companies, these are legit companies that will hold their value in time for the autists to take some gains off the table.

Here is the DD:

Global oil production has been carried by the US for the last decade. However, much of that production increase was achieved via shale/tight oil plays. At our peak, the US was producing 13.1 million barrels per day. 

Due to the pandemic, we shut off a ton of rigs to curb production. This was fine except their is one big problem: legacy declines. Shale wells can decline up to 80-90% in a year, so you can imagine what happens when you pull 75% of your rigs off line. Worse, companies/countries all over the world have significantly reduced capex related to oil during the pandemic.

It’s very likely that US production falls to 8-9 million barrels per day by the late summer. In that case, global production would be somewhere in the 95 million barrel per day range if cranked to the max. 

Global consumption was 100 million barrels per day in 2019. Since economic activity is essentially oil, if the economy opens up in a big way, supply will fall woefully short.

Fast forward to this summer, where most of the adult population is vaccinated and savings rates are at all time highs due to all the stimulus/unemployment money in the system. Now imagine that covid deaths are near 0 and people aren’t even getting tested anymore because they got the vaccine. What likely happens? My bet is on a surge in activity akin the the roaring 20s.

The play: 

I’m personally buying LEAPS in the super majors. I have around 3000 January 2022 $35 BP calls. I also have hundreds of XOM $55 January 2023 calls. Also have RDS $50 calls for January of 2022.

There are other plays in the oil patch but the super majors are the safest bet imo.

TLDR: Oil is going to the moon due to a supply/demand imbalance. Oil majors are still 40% off their 2019 lows and are about to take off.

Also, this is not investment advice. I just like these stocks."|2021-02-04 19:28:23.651516|../output/raw/2021/02/04/DueDiligence_flair_DD_192828.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['US', 'US', 'US', 'LEAPS', 'I', 'BP', 'I', 'XOM', 'RDS', 'I']|['BP', 'XOM']

But wait, Melvin just announced they covered their shorts, but GME didn’t go 🚀🚀🚀 and the price is falling. **Important note: if you go to the written CNBC article online, they are careful to say that they were not able to view receipts to verify that the short positions were covered.**

SO WHAT’S GOING ON?

Basically, there are two possible reasons the percentage of short interest on GME could be falling at the same time that the price of GME is falling.

1. Y’all paper handed retards got scared as the price dropped and jumped ship.
2. Some sneaky market manipulation by the Wall St. fuck wits at Melvin Capital (and others).

The first option is totally possible. I have no way of knowing who is holding and who isn’t. For a minute though, let’s assume you diamond handed apes are holding the line. Stonks go brrr and the price goes up to infinity and beyond.

This is a problem for the hedge funds shorting the stock. They know that as long as it looks like they have MASSIVE short positions, we have no reason to sell. That’s where their ability to write options comes in.

Hedge funds that are short a stock can write call options on that stock and sell the calls to a market maker. The market maker buys the call and sells them shares of “synthetic stock” against the option. **Synthetic stock** is shares that market makers control and is not counted as part of the float. This gives Melvin shares of stock for a finite period of time, which he can use to make it look as if his shorts are covered and try to make us lose interest. 

Let me run through that hypothetical one more time for clarity. Melvin is getting eaten for lunch by our GME holding brethren and needs help in this very public fight that he’s losing. He wants to make it look like he’s covered some of his shorts because the media pundits in Wall St.‘s pocket will report this without looking deeper. Melvin sells a TON of $800 GME calls to a market maker. In turn, the market maker sells Melvin the shares for those calls. Melvin then tells CNBC that his shorts are covered, and no one needs to check or anything because of course the media should just take his word for it. They’re smooth brained megaphones, so they do.

If the stock goes over $800, the market maker gets to buy the stock back and Melvin can’t take advantage of those sweet tendies. If it doesn’t, the media tells the public it’s old news, and the hedge funds wait out the enthusiasm, grinding down the price and discouraging many of those holding. Eventually, Melvin sells the stock back to the market maker at a loss, while getting to save his own ass/profit off the shorts he can now cover at a much lower price.

They can do this without anyone knowing at first because of delays in SEC reporting. We genuinely can’t know until the next report is released whether Melvin and the others actually covered. That said, they’re betting that we’ll break ranks if the stock price gets low enough before the reports, and they can just continue to whittle it down and wait us out.

Think about it. The media hammered us with the notion that the shorts had covered and this was all over. They jammed silver down our throats. They report every loss, but one day we end up in the green, it doesn’t interest the WSJ. Meanwhile, the price is driven down during daily AND overnight trading, as hedge funds sell shares back and forth to each other. What’s a few more bucks spent on temporary shares from a market maker and a few more days in the court of public opinion convincing us “barbarians” that we’ve lost, if they can profit off their shorts in the end?

Anyway, I don’t know any of this for certain, but it is a very real possibility. It also sure seems like a strategy I would employ if I was a hedge fund trying to end a very public battle of wills. 

TL;DR: 💎🙌

The % of institutional ownership is also relevant.  Why? Because the reason it is over 100% is because institutions own what they bought long PLUS what was purchased from the institutions going. Short. Remeber those shorts are not sold back to retail, they are sold to other institutions in large numbers of shares.  

Market beat had institutions buying a net of 22 million shares so far this year. (Actual total institutional ownership will come out next week with the short interest I think)

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/institutional-ownership/

This is on top of what they already had total up to the end of last year (we don't know this number yet)

Cnn money has has individual ownership at 15.9% of the 69million outstanding shares. Or  10.97 million shares.

What does this mean?
Well the free float is 50.1 million shares.  
The additional shares purchased by institutions plus what we all own = 32.97 million shares. 
That leaves 17.13 million shares (this is only accounting for what we know was bought up already this year without any information from last quarter).

The s3 data puts the short interest at 50% of the float. Or 25.05 million shares.
If there are at most 17 million shares available to trade, the shorts STILL don't have enough shares to cover.  They have to buy the entire unsold float to cover still open positions even if we assume the s3 data is correct and shorts have covered thus far.

Do you guys see what's going on here? Combined with the FINRA data that shows that since the Thursday where they restricted trading, 50% of the volume has been from BRAND NEW opened short positions. The fail-to-deliver rate for GME has skyrocketed as reddit has been buying up all the supply at once. Most major brokerages have literally prevented people from opening any new short positions. Institutional investors literally own over 100% of all shares ever issued. Do you see it? **Short sellers are literally whisking new shorts out of thin air, infinitely driving down the price, and there's nothing you can do about it.**

This is not a problem that HODLING can solve. The market is a measure of whether one side can influence the price of a security stronger than the other side. **This principle is broken if one side effectively has infinite money and just print more whenever they're losing.** You hold all the shares? They'll just print more, use those printed shares to cover their shorts, and then borrow fake shares to reshort, dilute the price, and make money all the way down. **They are printing money to bail themselves out.**

Buying into a fraudulent market isn't going to change anything. You need to protest and do anything to get your voice heard. You want proof that wall street is a huge scam against the american people? Here it is, it's up to you to do something now.

This isn't some Qanon theory. A qanon theory would be thinking the squeeze is gonna squoze anyways.

- Gotham is primarily geared for mission-critical services for governmental/military operations. A key feature is its software at the edge connectivity, allowing users to securely share information in the battlefield.

-Apollo provides an experience similar to Software as a Solution, enabling cloud-based operations under a secure ecosystem.


All in all they could essentially devise an algorithm to sort about just about anything (except for my pathetic life... and probs yours)

This is important. Going through SEC data here: https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm, I made a simple cumulative plot of FTD shares for some select companies since I thought the other plots showing spikes was not helpful in understanding the extent to which shares have already been found to be fradulent: https://imgur.com/a/JyiO6PO

I added up all the FTD since June 2020, and found 49 million shares that were not delivered in that time. That is shocking since the outstanding shares of GME are only 70 million or so. 

And this is what they let be discovered so far. Can you imagine how much they are actually hiding? 

The only way to get out of this is to keep buying. This exposes FTDs even more, so when you buy, you are not only getting a share that you legally are obligated to have ownership over, you are eliminating another ""share"" from the market down the line.

They live and breathe things like short squeezes and the article is dated as of Jan 29. Re GME:-

*”Firstly, in terms of timing of information, there was a 5.6m share reduction in shares on loan tied to settling Jan 13th trading, which reflected some amount of short covering, but that the short position in share terms had only declined slightly in reaction to the single day 57% increase in the share price.*

*The Jan 15 short interest data was published on Jan 27 and showed that the short interest had only declined by 9.4m shares as of mid-Jan, confirming the signal suggested by the share borrowing data*, **that the majority of the short position remained in place as of Jan 15th**

*The number of shares on loan declined by another 19m shares from Jan 22 - 28, suggesting that a larger portion of the short position was covered amid the surging share price during that week.*

**It is worth pointing out that the total short interest (or shares on loan) were only a tiny fraction of the traded volume during this time, which does not preclude short covering from having had an impact at specific points in time, but the buying of shares to cover shorts can only go so far in explaining the increased share price.”**

Everyone is free to grasp whatever they like from this but the two key things that I note are:-

1.	Only some, maybe half (19+9.4 out of total ~60m short), of the short were covered during Jan 22-28

2.	That such partial short covering was only one factor, maybe not even the biggest, for price rise. The bigger factors were momentum, short supply, and continuous buying

everything that you will hear is based on my own retarded research accompanied by my intuitive primitive feeling of logic (if it really exists). This will be a long text but maybe some of you actually mange to focus their monkey mind for a few minutes. If some assumptions or things I say aren't right and thus interfere with the rest of the things I say then please go a head and correct my retarded conclusions.

While the last 3 days took a big hit on my overall well being because my monke brain bought at an avg  share price of 300 holding 5 shares in total of which 2 are held on leverage (3:1) as a cfd which I entered monday right when the starting bell rang. I even wonder how my retarded ass was able to get itself out of the self pity and into a positive mindset again - but here I am.

I'm wondering a lot. There is this feeling inside of me the whole week as the prices are droping that  there isn't something right. The underlying logic how markets, prices, etc. work doesn't seem to apply on what currently is going on. I got remembered of the movie ""the big short"" where all the underlying assets where crashing but the overall index and the swaps didn't change in favour of the people that shorted. One guy from Mark Baums team said: ""it's like 1+1 equals fish"".

Even for my retarded monke brain their seems to be a big flaw in this whole logic. All those statistics and reports suggest that they closed most of their short positions over the days from thursday to monday but I'm having really hard times to understand how they bought dozens of millions of shares while the overall price went down. One major problem in the whole understanding of the situation of us small retail investors is following: we think its us small people vs. the hedgefund(s) that shorted but in reality there are so many big whale long investors on our side of the table that seem to be completely forgotten.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dyilswlthjf61.png?width=1058&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ebbd9d198d5b2bed2f347a62d1f8f3728b8990b

These are the 9 biggest institutional share holders that are holding around 64,170,000 shares if my monke hands tipped in the numbers correctly. We retail investors just take up around 10-20% at best 30% of what what ALL the institutional parties are holding. In fact our shareholding volumes are nothing compared to the institutions. If my assumption is correct then most of these big shareholders are actually holding their positions otherwise I don't know where those up to dates numbers of institutional shareholders are coming from. Yes some smaller institutional shareholders might left but if I compare the numbers from now to the numbers back in the end of 2020 then they even ADDED a lot of shares to their positions. Reddit is acting like we apes are the only one on the long side against the short guys. In reality there are major silent big players that profited immensely from the puplicity and hype surrounding reddit because that got in even more buyers.

We know for sure that the short position was 140% at some point until mid january and that institutional share holders held most of the available shares. Those big institutional players aren't dumb, those are professionals capable of maximizing every single penny to the maximum of profit. It's not only us that was/is interested in a massive short squeeze.  But as the number suggests their share numbers are still very high so the overall available and tradeable amount of shares has to be very low. I mean at the beginning of last week everyone anticipated a short squeeze. Our ape gang surely hold and I can only imagine all those big players also holding as everyone expects a short squeeze. We then come around the time of wednesday to friday last week. If a short squeeze would actually have happened then it has to be in that time. But again the overall available amount of people that are willing to sell their stocks should have been very low. To low to close out a short position that was estimated around 50-60 million stocks. I mean you could close this position with 10 million available shares. You buy 10 million, return them to your broker, then buy 10 million again and repeat this until all shorts are covered. BUT here is the thing: while this process is going the price of the share is GOING UP and not GOING DOWN and this whole process isn't done in about 15-20 minutes. The whole thing also would only work if those returned shares are actually being sold by the real owner again. I can't imagine that nobody wouldn't have noticed millions of bids in the lvl 2 data/orderbooks. Buying back this large amount of shares wouldn't have happened unnoticed.

From my perspective, the rise to 480$ was just the momentum through us retail investors and the hype of everyone trying to get into an already tightly packed rocket. As the price went up several big long positions sold which might be hedgefunds being long as they realized their gains as they went in at under 50$. They might sold a few million shares but no way that 30-60 million shares were sold to cover all those open short positions. Then as the momentum got broken for a short time, Robinhood either crashed or snitched the shit out of us to prevent the GME rocket from launching into the outer parts of our galaxy. People weren't able to buy, panic selling occured and people just put in their shares at market order and then it dipped down to a low of 112. Many people reason that the short guys covered their positions while this was happening but this is the point where my logic seems to be different than others. If shares in large quantities would have been bought in this time to cover the short positions then the price actually would have gone up immediately. The whole narrative of short positions being covered up in this time span doesn't make ANY sense. 30-60 million individual shares would been required to be sold in those times. On thursday the total trading volume was 57 million which is lower then todays trading volume of 61 million. The 3 day average trading volume from wednesday to friday was 67,4 million, this is just 7 million higher then the 3 day average of the last 3 days which is 60,9 million. The 3 day average trading volume prior to wednesday (22,25,26 january) was 185 million with just a 100$ price increase which is nothing compared to the volatility on the following days. By best will I can't imagine even just 30 million INDIVIDUAL shares being traded in those days to cover half the short position. Just the insane amount of day-trading, redditors and other retail investors could easily generate such a volume. 10,000 shares that are traded 1,000 times a day can create a trading volume of 10,000,000 by themself. Even if Robin Hood restricted buying and thus making it hard for retail buyers to buy stocks. Do you really think those big guys which are long with us just dump their positions as some scary chickens. These guys just sit back and watch the show, yes some sold but in my opinion those professionals exactly know if an actual short squeeze is going on and that 400$ is just a launchpad from which the rocket starts. Prices crashing on thursday was just another possibility for them getting more stocks.

So if we assume that the squeeze didn't happen between wednesday- friday then the only other possibility, beside that it didn't happened at all yet, is the 22th, 25th and 26th of january but for an actual short squeeze in these dimensions a slow and steady price increase from 40 to 150 is not anything like a short squeeze.

So what actually happened? There was no short squeeze yet. Plain and simple. The thursday price increase was the momentum building up and Robinhood was pulling the the cords of the launchpad and everybody panicked because this form of manipulation (or just bad covering from their side) and exclusion of retail market participants was never seen before. Until this time there was no freaking doubt that the rocket will launch, nobody doubted that shit, nobody. That's why people put in their life savings and everyone was going ape shit in here and we just totally blew up the world media and pissed on the wallstreet. But this one dip in price showed them big hedgefunds how vunerable and manipulative we as swarm hive intelligence really are. They started a whole campaign on us and how their short positions are closed and how the party is over. They had time over the weekend to plan their moves and they simply went for the strategy of dumping the prices while spreading the attention to silver and other meme stocks through bots, media and other psychological tricks. They might took 500.000 non existing naked shorts and dumped down the prices. I mean the whole fucking world wanted to buy GME as monday came along. So many people wanted to buy so how the actual fuck did the price go down from 320 to 220. 100 dollars down with a volume of just 37 million. They just constantly put in tranches of a certain specific quantity like 256, 251, 601, 327 through the whole day constantly undercutting themselves and other hedges being short picking up on those. On the other side there were willing retail buyers trying to make a good deal while being anxious of missing a ticket to the moon so many just put in a market order and as those hedgefunds tranches constantly underbid themselves they slowly drove down the price and from then on they just went to our sub checking how people are reacting to it. Everyone has no fucking clue why the price is going down because we all are fucking retarded apes with basic cognitive functions that aren't experienced with all the dirty tricks of the big guys. Then tuesday came and they just did the same thing over and over again. At some point at tuesday there was a small momentum building up and the price went up from 105-100 to about 130-140 and it was at this point that I was watching the level 2 data/order books. There were several halts in a few minutes and right as the price was about 139 dollars there was a ASK or in other words SELL order coming in 15k shares at 125 dollars which caused a immediate drop in prices that was just higher then 10% which caused another halt because every buy order immeditately got filled by that 125 order. Who the actual fuck sells 15k shares at 125 dollars undercutting the actual price with 15 dollars WHILE the stock goes up?!?!?! I can't give you any evidence on this but I'm 100% sure this happened as directly after the order was placed the halt occured 2-3 seconds later. After that they managed to dump shares back down to 112. This was the breaking point for many in here. Everyone expected a short squeeze and in 2 days from hype to sell out we went down huge and wsb became paperhand bitch land. On wednesday all those paperhands did their best to justify their selling just as we seek confirmation of the short squeeze is still happening and not over yet. Totally normal and to be expected but in the end they broke the moral as the prices kept being low. The short hedgefunds shorted at 200-400 while driving down the prices themself. I have not a single doubt that price dumping occured on a massive scale and a market full of retail traders is the perfect prey for that. Combine that with financial media all around the globe reporting the same brainless bullshit and you get the situation we currently are in. They exactly know that many people bought on margin and they actively tried to break through those automatic sell walls. The price over the last days is just a totally bad representation of what actually is going on.

I might be so fucking retarded that everything I am talking about is actual nonsense and that short positions are all covered but if my primitive ape intuition is right then the short guys fired blank cartridges into the air and we monkeys aren't able to differintiate a loud bang from live ammunition.

In my monkey mind those guys are still heavily in their short position but they did their best to get down the market price so the interest fee is going down tremendously giving them more time of actually playing this game while also doubling down their shorts and getting back in some of their losses. Yet they still have to cover all those short positions and also the short positions created at 200-400$. They play the long game because they know we are retarded but at some point they have to leave. Feb 9 will reveal the truth but for me its obvious that there is something out our attention is going on. All it took for them was 500.000-1.000.000 naked shares to dumb the price, a few calls with their buddies from financial media that they regulary snort coke of hookers and voila you break down a hype.

I think we reddit people forgot about the big guys on our long side and how much shares they actually hold. I think they are quiet because the more people sell their tickets to the moon, the more money they can make, they are just slowly buying the shares of all people that leave and don't loose a word about whats actually going on because in the end they are just other big hedgefonds trying to profit. It's big longs vs big shorts and we retail investors are just small monkeys annoying the crap out of everyone. They might decreased their losses but if the squeeze is happening they still have to pay the rest.

But nonetheless I will be fucking holding the lines until the end. I'm not selling my shares. It's either moon or I take them into my fucking grave or my kids will wonder when they read my last will and stumble across my GME shares. Then they realize what a fucking retard I was back then but maybe those shares skyrocket in 2106 when Gamestop was swiped away every single market participant and controlls the totality of the whole gaming industry in this galaxy and beyond. Who fucking knows - all I know is that I am not selling

I tried posting the DD here before but it got removed by Auto-mod and I got temporarily banned. \*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

**The play**: Long stocks and ATM leap calls

Summary: Aphria is trading at a hefty discount when comparing price multiples to its largest viable competitor Canopy Growth Corp (WEED.TO). As of the release of the company’s recent Q2 2021 financial statement, Aphria now has more revenue and a much lower net loss than Canopy Growth; however, despite all that, Canopy still has a market cap that is 4 times larger than Aphria. This I believe is a major pricing inefficiency created by the market because both companies are showing significant growth in their revenue while capturing additional market share in a growing industry while only Aphria has shown investors that is the only dominant marijuana company that can cut down costs and increase profit margins. Because of this, the premium in Canopy’s market cap is not justifiable and Aphria should be valued at least as much or even more than Canopy Growth.

&#x200B;

**Industry Background Info**

Ever since the Canadian government legalized the recreational use of marijuana in 2018, Canadian weed companies have risen to become the dominant players on the global stage. As of right now, the four largest weed companies by market cap are Canopy Growth (WEED.TO), Cronos (CRON.TO), Aphria (APHA.TO), and Aurora (ACB.TO).

Of this grouping, only Aphria has consistently shown investors that it can grow its business from both the top and bottom lines all the while making mergers and acquisitions that will allow it to capitalize on the growing recreational market in the U.S. Here let me show you why Aphria has the strongest fundamentals.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hguojmpiakf61.png?width=769&format=png&auto=webp&s=72e816543fa581371895f42aa6ce940e9ab392ca

If you pull up Canopy’s recent quarterly report and look at their income statement, you will find that even though cost of goods sold (COGS) has a slightly decreased ratio to revenue from 76% for the first 3 quarters in 2019 (145,162 / 189,012) to 78% in 2020 (213,107 / 269,916), its total operating expenses excluding COGS, is still **LARGER** than its revenue (operating expenses are 489,216 for 2021). What’s more is that over half of this comes from SGA (Selling, General, and Admin). What this shows is that even though the company is growing, it is not becoming more efficient, rather it is becoming more inefficient.

[link](https://www.canopygrowth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CGC-Q2-FY21-FS.pdf)

As for the other two companies Cronos and Aurora, their fundamentals are even more atrocious than Canopy’s. Cronos has revenue roughly 29million for first three quarters of 2020 which is peanuts compared to Aphria and Canopy. What’s more is that the company is showing earnings that are HIGHER than their total revenue. I suspect this is a result of their revaluation of their marijuana inventory which is complete bullshit because it assumes company can sell it all at the current fair market price and no auditor can accurately assess the true value of a living and growing agricultural product (trust me my background is in accounting). Why this company is worth over 5bil is beyond me. Aurora is similar with tiny amounts of revenue while operating at massive losses. The company didn’t even sell anything in 20q2 so I’m not going to go into great depth with either of them.

***Tl;Dr:*** *The only viable competitor with Aphria is Canopy and right now Canopy is making less money than Aphria both in the top and bottom lines. The other two companies are essentially the weird kid in the class sitting in a corner eating chalk. Bless their hearts.*

&#x200B;

**Aphria Fundamentals**

Alright let’s get to the good stuff. Here is a pic of part of their income statement for you to follow:

[link](https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aphria-Q2-2021-consolidated-financial-statements.pdf)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xjdudb3kakf61.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=d73b5cbc5ee704f1295fb04f46593e67993f19bf

Right now, COGS ratio for Aphria is comparable with Canopy. By Nov 2020, ratio is 71% (219,136 / 306,221) and 74% (188,670 / 246,712) in 2019. But if you go down the statement you will find out that in the breakdown of their operating expenses, the company actually manages to keep expenses relatively stable as revenue grows. The only line that really stands out for me is the transaction cost expense of 25.6m which relates to business acquisitions. I think most of the 25.6m is related to their Tilray acquisition that I will discuss later on. Other than that, the company manages to stabilize its expenses and its total operating cost is far less than their revenue, which is something Canopy cannot say.

[link](https://aphriainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aphria-Q2-2021-consolidated-financial-statements.pdf)

***Tl;dr:*** *Aphria is a lean machine while Canopy is like a toddler that took one too many steroids and suddenly grew to the size of a NFL linebacker all the while having an IQ of 4. What this means is that Canopy’s growth is by no means sustainable and the only way for the company to continue operations is if it manages to grow revenue fast enough it outpaces expenses, but right now that is not the case.*

&#x200B;

T**ilray Merger Implications**

Recently in 2020 Aphria announced an all-stock merger that will be carried out by a reverse stock split **(meaning Aphria will exchange 0.8 APHA shares per TLRY share**). After the merger is finalized, Aphria will control 63% of Tilray. One of the key advantages of the reverse split is that it decreases the amount of total shares outstanding, making the shares more valuable.

This is something I feel like retail investors need to look at more closely. The reason why is that the merger will give Aphria a strategic advantage of breaking into the US and EU markets.

[link](https://www.livemint.com/news/world/tilray-and-aphria-announce-merger-to-create-the-largest-global-cannabis-company-11608361067376.html)

On a final point, the merger with Tilray will also let Aphria directly compete with Canopy Growth Corp in the marijuana beverage industry. [link](https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2020/05/05/Constellation-Brands-increases-stake-in-Canopy-Growth-Corp#:~:text=Constellation%20Brands%20has%20increased%20its,Canopy%20Growth%20Corp%20to%2038.6%25.&text=Collectively%2C%20the%20common%20shares%20increase,issued%20and%20outstanding%20common%20shares). For those of you that don't know, Constellation Brands own a 38% stake in CGC. This investment is pivotal to the company's ability to produce cannabis-infused beverages at their plant in Smith Falls Ontario. What people often overlook with the Aphria-Tilray merger though is that Tilray has an agreement with AB InBev, the world's largest brewer [link](https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/10/10/tilray-ab-inbev-to-launch-cbd-drinks-in-late-2019-thc-drinks-to-come-later.html). This agreement has allowed Tilray to launch their own drinks in late 2019, thus allowing them to be competitive with Canopy in the drinks market as well.

The advantage comes from the fact that even though Tilray is headquartered in Canada, it is registered as a US firm. What’s more is that Tilray also has agreements with EU countries that allow it to expand its position in the EU cannabis market. Tilray has announced it has been selected by the French national Agency for the Safety of medicines and Health Products to supply Good Manufacturing Processes certified medical cannabis products in France. In addition, the company also has agreements with other EU nations like Portugal that you can examine at your own free time.

***Tl;Dr****: Aphria buy Tilray. Tilray in U.S and deal with E.U. This let Aphria go to U.S and E.U. This let Aphria bring in big mooneee.*

&#x200B;

**U.S Marijuana Legalization**

The Democrats taking control of the White House, Senate, and Congress is the equivalent of the second coming of Christ for the marijuana industry, and no this is not an understatement. Right now, marijuana is legal for either medical or recreational uses in 15 states but is still illegal on the federal level. What this means is that companies need to wait for states to legalize individually and even when they do so, there are still significant red tapes abound that will greatly hinder industry growth. One of the most prevalent examples of red tape is the fact that marijuana dispensaries do not have access to proper banking so they operate exclusively as a cash-based business. This is because if a bank provides services to a weed dispensary, it can be charged on the federal level for money laundering.

That is all about to change because the Dems in the Senate announced that one of their main goals with their majority is to end the federal criminalization of marijuana use. In addition, Chuck Schumer already announced that a draft of the bill will be introduced in the first half of 2021.

[link](https://www.9news.com/article/news/nation-world/federal-marijuana-legalization-senate/507-4de652b8-5f81-4ed4-94a2-502e5c1bef41)

What’s more is that when weed is legalized on the federal level, it is actually legalized on the state level as well. This is because of something called the Supremacy Clause in the constitution that established that federal law controls when state and federal law are in conflict.

*“but* u/gushingranny1\*, if that’s the case, how come I can smoke pot in California huuuuh?”\*

Well listen here you little turd, granny going to explain to ya.

You see the constitution, though the Tenth Amendment delegates police powers to the states. This means that even though states cannot prevent federal prosecution of their citizens, they can still eliminate state prosecutions.

[link](https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/federal-crime/medical-marijuana-federal-laws.htm)

&#x200B;

**Tl;Dr**: Once weed is legalized on federal level, floodgates will open. You think marijuana stocks got crazy in 2017? Just wait for this one.

**Investment Thesis**

Livent’s primary source of revenue is lithium, a key component for electric batteries. Livent is one of the five major suppliers of lithium worldwide and the only pure-play provider in North America. We view Livent as well positioned to leverage the global transition from internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric vehicles (EV), due to its significant technology expertise, global supply chain, and partnerships with OEMs, including Tesla. Hence, Livent’s premium valuation accurately reflects the company’s ability to gain share in a growing market driven by a favorable regulatory environment and an increasing sense of corporate responsibility.

**Key Catalysts:**

\- *Favorable regulatory environment will drive EV adoption.* China is the largest and fastest growing market for EVs, followed by Europe. China recently extended tax exemptions for EVs while Europe enacted the European Climate Law with the goal of making Europe climate neutral by 2050. We expect the Biden administration to pursue similar policies, albeit of a more incremental nature. Additionally, corporations are increasingly adopting energy efficient targets as part of a greater awareness of their social responsibility. We view the favorable regulatory environment as the primary catalyst for EV adoption and one that is largely sustainable regardless of political and social changes.

\- *Livent is well positioned to leverage the growing market for nickel-rich batteries.* Within the electric battery market, nickel-rich batteries are generally preferred for high performance EVs. Nickel-rich batteries require lithium hydroxide, which Livent produces through a two-stage chemical process. Livent estimates the market share for nickel-rich batteries should increase from about 25% today to 75% by the end of the decade.

\- *Recent demand uptick suggests pricing likely to recover.* Lithium pricing had been under pressure due to a supply glut heading into 2020 which the pandemic exacerbated by reducing demand. (Lithium pricing contracts are long-term although lithium carbonate pricing has declined more than 50% since the beginning of the pandemic.) Industry experts currently estimate lithium pricing needs to rise by roughly 10% to incentivize suppliers to expand capacity. We believe this scenario is likely to occur given some recent encouraging signs, including robust October sales of EVs in China and Europe.

\- *Scale and Argentina operations offer relative cost advantage.* Regardless of the trajectory of the pricing rebound, however, Livent has a relative cost advantage due to its brine-based Argentina mine, which is more cost efficient than spodumene mines [\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn1). Additionally, Livent is vertically integrated enabling it to capture value along every step of the supply chain. Longer-term, lithium suppliers are pursuing alternatives such as the potential to mine lithium from clay and recycling existing batteries to insulate margins from global disruptions. Although supply may eventually be impacted by new entrants such as Bolivia and India, there are significant political and logistical hurdles which will need to be overcome.

**Company Description**

Livent is a pure play lithium company headquartered in Philadelphia, PA. The company went public in 2018 as a spin-off from FMC Corporation. Livent extracts lithium from its plant in Argentina and then converts the metal into lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide, which are the critical components for electric batteries. Analysts forecast Livent to generate $400mn in revenue in 2021 and EBITDA margins in the high-teens.

Livent recently extended its supply agreement with Tesla through 2021. We expect this contract to be renewed past the current term. Livent also entered into a joint venture with private equity firm Pallinghurst Resources to buy Canada's lithium projects, which are spodumene based. Through the JV, New Nemaska Lithium, Livent will own 25% of the economics, which should provide economies of scale for its North American operations.

**Industry and Market Opportunity**

Lithium is an alkali metal found in natural substances such as rocks. Lithium is extremely light, a property which makes it ideal for storing energy. In its pure form, lithium actually has an energy density equivalent to gasoline although a typical EV car battery has a much lower density due to the additional inputs required such as casings and electrolyte fluid. In addition to Livent, there are four other global players of which Livent is one of only two providers in North America.

The lithium opportunity is primarily tied to growth in electric batteries although grid storage is emerging as a secondary use case. (Despite the attention paid to electric cars, electric buses are actually further along the adoption curve due to scale benefits.) Battery sales accounted for 65% of global lithium demand in 2019 and analysts are forecasting this percentage to continue to rise steadily. Given lithium is a commodity, the only limiting supply factor is a price high enough to warrant mining. A third party research firm, Fortune Business Insights, estimates that the global [lithium market](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=rnOqyS-E5qWpEUFLoMeh3w3gSgw-u8NK1t-DXVE8CZI_qSX_FG7DaFbNfwOY1GCj8-hZsRn-ezuSitWBnrb4WpkSApmUiWBUpkd_X_Ms4WGIMiFgBeI_XOUAv_u0vuyiAnFinChKftDQSSS8I1GZbg==) opportunity will reach $8.24 billion by the end of 2027, up from $4.1 billion in 2019 (9.2% CAGR) while demand is expected to increase almost tenfold over the next decade.

Deloitte and IHS Markit forecast EVs to account for approximately 30% of total passenger car and light duty vehicles by 2030.

**Financials and Valuation**

Approximately 80% of Livent’s revenue is generated from sales of battery-grade lithium hydroxide and butyllithium. Energy storage is the primary use case for Livent’s batteries, including rechargeable batteries for EVs, portable electronics and grid storage systems. Approximately 65% of Livent’s sales are from Asia, followed by North America (20%) and Europe (15%).

3Q review: Revenue improved sequentially as demand slowly returned although margins and Adjusted EPS missed consensus due to COVID-related costs. The company did not provide 4Q guidance although management noted volumes should continue to improve.

4Q and 2021 Outlook: Industry experts were originally forecasting a flattish year for global lithium demand but have since revised their 2020 estimates upward to reflect an uptick in EV sales late this year. Hence, we believe there is upside to 4Q consensus. For 2021, analysts are forecasting revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of $400 million and $75 million, respectively. Given the required capacity demands, Livent is not expected to be cash-flow positive for the foreseeable future.

First off, housekeeping - $BB seems to have decoupled from the meme stock grouping today. Yay. But if you’re watching the ticker you might want to get checked out for paperhanditis, as **$BB gang = long haul gain**

Yesterday somebody asked whether I had anything bad to say about $BB. The answer is no, as I am balls deep in $BB and like the stock. ***However*** \- I am an intellectually honest $BB shill.

So here are some recent concerns and thoughts.

**1) Ford just partnered with Android to** [replace QNX in its vehicles](https://www.obj.ca/article/techopia/ford-drops-blackberry-qnx-infotainment-platform-inks-deal-google)

* Unit economics for QNX aren’t public so unclear how this would impact $BB financials. In addition, the release states they’re targeting new vehicles w/ Android on the road in 2023. (1) I can’t even count that high and (2) knowing ford if they say 2023 it’ll be 2025
* People still don’t really understand QNX. [Read this technical outlay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoj02/bb_qnx_microkernel_cybersecurity_bull_case/) QNX is in[all parts of the](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/connected-autonomous-vehicles/_jcr_content/main/par/section/par/picture.coreimg.jpeg/1606404570309/car-diagram-update.jpeg) car, especially in functions where security and safety are crucial. Android is replacing the dashboard infotainment console, frankly for good reason b/c Ford Sync sucks and Google Maps is world-class - IN addition, [QNX actually platforms for Android app](http://www.qnx.com/news/pr_5602_1.html)s (additional mitigant - it's not necessarily a zero sum game)

**2) CFO sold all of his shares, and some other executives sold as well**

* People often don’t understand executive comp and how they think. Jack and Jill have expensive private school and your wife's been eyeing that new bag. Equity is a big part of your comp, and sometimes you neeed to liquidate that comp b/c b/c Hermes doesn't taken $BB as legal tender (though they should if you ask me. ).
* Let's look at Steve Rai (CFO) . [He apparently sold 33k shares, but as of last fiscal year he had > 90k unearned / unvested unveste](https://sec.report/Document/0001070235-20-000036/)d. Corp execs don't get all their comp @ once - (1) It vests with tenure, and (2) gets earned w/ performance. In otherwords, **Steve didn't sell all his exposure** to Blackberry - He sold the shares **he had in hand**, and from his perspective a significant part of his personal ""net worth"" is still exposed to equity comp from the Company that will vest and be earned over time. ***In the investing world, that's called skin in the game.***
* **Most importantly, John ""Papa"" Chen sold** ***none*** **of his shares during the craziness last week and has c**[ontinually taken his bonuses as equity](https://financialpost.com/investing/blackberry-ceo-chen-gets-128-million-award-to-continue-revival)

**3) Growthinvestor123 you’re a fool and your comps are wrong - $BB may not be a phone company any more but the other highly-valued endpoint security / cyber businesses are just way better and not appropriate to compare to $BB**

* [No](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/blackberry-ltd-stock-outperforms-market-on-strong-trading-day-01612474305-f6c47111fc33?link=MW_latest_news)

**Ok. With those out the way, here are are some other things I am scared of, in no particular order -**

* Company misses earnings - $BB's mentioned weakness in new customer signings when Covid started, esp. from automotive. While it’s true that everyone put major purchases on hold, the resultant bounceback across industry should show up in the numbers next quarter…hopefully
* A major security breach involving SPark or QNX eroding trust in the Company’s security / safety pipeline
* A bunch of flightly monkeys jump back onto $BB train which in the short term creates a rally but exacerbate volatility and continues to reinforce the notion that $BB is a meme stock.
* John Papa Chen goes skiing and falls off a chairlift - (but he won't, because he strikes me as a [steady-eddy, safety-first f](http://cdn02.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/M1vJyN8T.jpg)ella)

Alright retards, let’s talk about SUNPOWER (SPWR)

OP, the “investor” fuck that he is, is looking for a long term hold and he thinks he found it: Sunpower (SPWR)

Sunpower is one of the leading Solar installation/manufacturing/battery storage companies in the industry. And that fucking industry is rapidly growing. We are talking printer go fucking brrrr. Thank sleepy!

Just google “top solar companies” and tell OP which companies have the best product and best customer ratings. Spoiler alert, Sunpower is #1.

Sunpower hit $57 dollars before crashing down to $40 where it hit hard hard resistance today. Were talkin huge buy orders for 2 mill+. And even look at who owns it - bunch Blackrock, Citedal, the likes. I agree, fuck these guys, but at the same time, why bet against them? It’s gonna go up, and keep going up.

What most people don’t know, is, that Sunpower has started to roll out a new product that will consume market share from everyone’s favorite, Tesla. The product is called SunVault. SunVault is an energy storage battery that very well competes and rivals the Tesla power wall. I believe that SunVault will sell extremely well and could bring Sunpower up to Tesla levels in terms of solar and energy storage. The product is capable of powering your home for nearly 3 days. And when combined with the high efficiency panels that Sunpower offers, it’s game changing. 

Some technical analysis for you autists. Sunpower literally has a revenue of 274 million, while Sunrun (at over 2x the market cap) is at 209 million. Sunpower also cut manufacturing costs by splitting into two companies (SPWR and Maxeon Technolgies). Maxeon is manufacturing solar panels for SPWR, and they are doing it overseas. This split happened in late August and has yet to affect their profit, but will completely reshape SPWR’s profit margin in the near future.

SunVault only started rolling out last summer and Solar sales don’t really pick up till spring. So getting in now and ride the rocket to the moon!

Alright listen up. The squeeze is either happening on or before the 9th, or not at all. On the 9th, Nasdaq short interest data gets updated after market close. This will tell us whether all these places reporting decreases in short interest like S3 are reporting false data or not.

If they are, the plan drafted up by them and whoever paid them off probably goes like this: S3 publishes fake data to drive down retail interest while ladder attacks and share buying limits work to dump the share price. If the Nasdaq data shows there still is high short interest, at least for the days S3 reported on, it would contradict S3 and make them out to be implicit in manipulation. Considering they want to remain a business in the future, they would only agree to this if short sellers made them look right in the end. This would give us our first signal that the squeeze is coming, S3 suddenly starts reporting upticks in short interest just before the 9th. Shorts would then work to drive the price into the ground to their desired price while lining this up with S3 reporting ""gradual"" short interest increases, which is easy thanks to these daily ladder attacks. 

If they aren't, then there is no squeeze, and everyone here should take to the streets to protest the SEC for failing to protect retail investors.

At this point, the ladder is working. GME hype is six feet underground. But, considering short sellers are the greediest form of human filth on the planet, it's not impossible for them to do what I've outlined above, especially if the interest on these shorts is pennies compared to what they'll make if the price stays low. Keep an eye on how places like S3 start reporting data in the days leading up to the 9th, that'll be the signal. 💎🙌"|2021-02-05 09:05:41.255002|../output/raw/2021/02/05/DueDiligence_flair_DD_090543.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['SEC', 'GME']|['GME']

Alright retards, I hate to see $BB get labeled as a full on meme stock as it has the best fundamentals and currently undervalued still. On top of all news from the past few weeks on partnerships and other catalysts. I figured I’d post up some more info on it from today. 

As you can see from today’s chart, it finally started to divert from the main meme stocks now. BlackBerry is seeing significant order and backlog growth. 83% of the company’s software revenue is recurring. 

In 2021, there are going to be many catalysts for BlackBerry. These catalysts will support the stock price bigly. Application providers will be able to get their hands on IVY in September 2021. 20 car manufacturers will be targeted. The good thing is BlackBerry will make a public announcement whenever one signs up. Also, BlackBerry is now increasingly free cash flow positive. This is a huge game changer for the company. Investors will value BlackBerry stock much more attractively because of it. There was $29 million in free cash flow for its latest quarter.

Tiny D&D => $AUPH

Overview

In Jan,  had their drug (Lupkynis) approved that treats Lupus something... idk I'm not a doctor. This drug replaces an outdated treatment and is taken orally (nice). In the U.S. between 200,000 and 300,000 poor souls could benefit from this after paying $140,000 a year (AUPH expects $65k net per patient) because big pharma is greedier than HFs. The important part is they received a patent for this treatment that lasts till 2037 so CVS can't make a generic over-the-counter version. 

Why do I think it is a buy? It is almost back to pre-approval price (around $15) and for the very questionable math I did below.

Because this is a one of a kind Lupus killer, I am assuming they will get at least 20% of the 200,000 Lupus victims (40,000) X $40,000 net per (I am being extremely conservative) = a grand total of $1.6 billion from the drug. Can they even sell it? maybe, idk I saw a few insider texts from nurses who received messages from the AUPH sales team looking to get something going. I don't care about that tho. I care about them getting bought out by a big ole pharma daddy for 30+ a share.

One thing that will be interesting to watch tomorrow:

GME was on the NYSE Short Sale Restricted List (SSR, no not the USSR) earlier this week. This gets automatically triggered if the stock price drops more than 10% in a day. It basically enforces the Uptick Rule, which says you can only short on an upswing.

Coincidentally, yesterday (2/3) was the only day since last Thursday that the price has gone up even slightly.

Both companies are back on it as of this evening until 2/8. This means the price may go back up tomorrow. If so, my smooth brain opinion is that the huge downswing we’ve been seeing this week has been massive shorts being reopened. Maybe the NYSE short data being released on 2/9 will tell us something interesting. Only time will tell at this point.

This week has been a rough one - portfolios blown up, dreams dashed, losses grudgingly taken. Lessons learned, ""I told you so’s"" said, confusion abounding. Some people are on the fence about getting out at pennies on the dollar; some plan to die with their withered fingers clutching their heavily devalued shares. Both of these groups are looking for some hopium, and I hope to provide that in this post with some actual information rather than the garbage I am seeing spammed all over this sub. My account is 8 years old and I haven't posted anything in 4 1/2, but I've been a longtime lurker of WSB and became enamored with the GME story back in November so I have digested about every morsel posted here since then. I am not an investing expert in any way, just doing this for fun. Shoutout to /u/FatAspirations for his great posts that really got me in this thing deep.

**The Fall**

We all know what happened here so I won't spend a lot of time on it, but GME is down 87% over the past week. I know everyone has noticed the stark contrast between the exuberant mood of 1/27 - 1/29 and the stomach churning disappointment of 2/1 - 2/4. Uncertainty about Gamestop is at an all time high, with people comparing different numbers as of different dates from different sources with no clear picture of what is true. This combined with an influx of new users, infiltration by bots and shills, and a struggle for control of the subreddit has left this place in complete disarray. Very few people overall and no one here can really say definitively why Gamestop took the plunge this week, but there are certainly no shortage of theories: hedge funds closed their shorts on the way up, hedge funds struck a deal behind closed doors, people paperhanded on the way down, etc. I am here to provide an alternate view of what happened that I've seen whispers of but not fully fleshed out.

**The Theory**

It has been widely publicized that short interest in Gamestop declined sharply sometime in the last week. Ortex's reported short interest declined from 51M on 1/27 to 39M on 1/28 to 29M on 1/29. S3 partners issued a drastic correction to their estimated short interest over the weekend, reporting a reduction from ~58M shares as of Friday 1/29 to ~27M as of Monday 2/1. This led the company, previously championed on WSB, to be denounced as being bought by The Man...I am not so sure of that. I propose that while the estimated short interest has declined, there is a technical reason behind it.

This leads me to the crux of my theory...read [this article](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) before continuing. I know many of you can't read, so have your wife's boyfriend read it to you for whatever it costs...

Didn't read it? Fine, I'll summarize. A hedge fund that is short a stock and facing a squeeze can write (sell) far OTM call options on a stock to a market maker. When the market maker purchases these options, the market maker has a legal obligation to remain delta neutral by essentially ""naked shorting"" the stock. This produces a wave of the ""synthetic long shares"" that anyone following the Gamestop story has heard a lot about. The hedge fund selling the far OTM call options then buys these synthetic long shares that were created by the market maker. The hedge fund can then report that they ""bought back"" their original short position via buying long shares, even though they really haven't; the synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call options they initiated because of the hedging of the market maker! By using this maneuver, hedge funds are able to report reduced short interest, but the short interest hasn't really changed.

Take a minute, read this a couple times, digest it.

**The Evidence**

I read a post the other day (forgot from who, sorry) that brought up unusual activity on the options chain for 2/5 $800 calls. I can't remember for sure what it was on Monday-Tuesday, but EOD Wednesday the open interest on $800 calls was 24k, with 16k more volume today (note that the 16k isn't fully added to the 24k, it can be the same option being traded back and forth). I haven't looked at the option chain a ton, but I do know that is pretty heavy volume.

Per MarketBeat, as of 1/15/20 the outstanding shares (including synthetic) was 102M. I am not sure if there is a reliable source that updates daily, but we know there are lots of synthetics out there because of the original shorting.

**An Outstanding Question**

The theory described above is on its face neutral; market makers create the synthetic long shares to remain delta neutral against the OTM calls that the hedge funds sold them, and the hedge funds buy shares to cover them. While the market makers undoubtedly are creating the synthetic longs, is it possible that the hedge funds actually **aren't** buying the shares to cover them? That the simple transaction of selling the call is enough to falsely reduce short interest? This I do not know. If the hedge funds didn't buy those shares, then the market makers ""naked shorting"" could be a large contributor to the drop in price over the past few days.

**Conclusion**

This could be the last gasp of a man that rose and fell with the Gamestop tsunami and is now taking one last shot at greatness before packing it in and moving on - I hope this post gives you that shot in your mind for at least one more day. What I will say is that despite the state of this subreddit, it can get better if everyone can show a little more empathy for others' situations. Some people are here to make money and read investing ideas: good. Some people want to use Gamestop as a launching pad for reforming Wall Street: good. Some people just love to meme and haven't even bought in: good. What isn't good is when you make low effort shitposts with rockets and diamonds and nothing of substance; I think all the aforementioned groups wouldn't mind these people leaving. Despite the language being stunning to an outsider, WSB had a culture that worked for them and new people visiting the subreddit need to understand what it was and why it was precious. The culture may evolve a bit going forward but let's get more of what made this place great: Insane YOLOs, unique loss porn, and the occasional DD that made you feel like you discovered electricity for the first time.

- Earnings is 14 days away I expect a run up to earnings.  They are holding an ""investor day"" in conjunction with their earnings so you know they have something good to share.

- Holiday sales - I'm certain walmart killed it during the holidays, people can't spend on vacations so they are holding cash and everyone went into the holidays knowing their $600 stimulus was coming.

- Walmart+ -  Walmart+ is already estimated to be in 10% of households and is growing fast - you can say its priced in but I think the free same-day delivery is a real differentiator for them.  I also anticipate more benefits to be added to Walmart+ to help them compete with Amazon Prime benefits.

&#x200B;

This community is all over the place. And for good reason. With millions joining the sub in a matter of weeks and the single greatest meme event in Wall Street history, there’s a lot of misinformation and clouded sentiment. Compounded by internal politics and manipulation.

Turn all of that off for a second and hear some real wisdom.

Here’s the DD for y’all that haven’t been around for more than a month. For credibility and backstory: I’ve been following u/DeepFuckingValue (our Lord and Savior) since July. We all knew who Roaring Kitty was on YouTube and his DD and streams were the shit! Go checkout his channel and you’ll understand where you’re actually sitting at on charts (hint: probably holding the bag currently) but don’t get discouraged yet!

Back when GME was a pitiful $4, DFV was sharing fundamentals as well as speculation that the stock was worth $50-80. That’s likely what the price will reflect long term. However, the case for a short squeeze was a bonus and really memed hard in December. That’s what probably lead a lot of you noobs to this sub.

So what does that mean for the future? Shorts are still high. 20% short interest is considered extreme. Conservative (and likely manipulated) estimates still show interest above 50%. Fuck the float hype and short squeeze. The reality is you don’t need the hype for the obviously bullish moves coming throughout 2021 on GME. Most of you retards have probably lost 70% or more, so there’s no real reason to fret or stress about losing more anyways, right?! Instead, here’s what you do:

Cost average at this current dip. Meaning buy more with whatever disposable income you’ve got. It’s going to have support based on the 50 day moving average and fundamentals. The stock should be trading at $80-100 in my opinion and based on (mostly) fundamentals. GME earnings in March are likely to make a case for positive outlook for the company to $100 and beyond through 2021. You may not see it rise to $300+ this year if you bought the top, but you may realize some conservative gains that net you some profits or at least break even. Optimistically, there’s still a really good chance the squeeze has a round 2, but don’t count on it. Make the long term play if you like the company and stock and just hold. Learn your lessons and get better at due diligence.

Do what makes sense for you, and always do your own research. Yea, we’re degenerates/retards/autists but many of us in this sub are also ridiculously smart and wear those labels ironically. We just like to have fun and make stupid bets with our tendies. That’s the whole premise here, and I don't think anyone expected the surge of idiots that just follow along blindly. This is never meant to be financial advice. Just a place to laugh, learn, and love; while eating shit or tendies depending on the day!"|2021-02-05 09:05:41.255002|../output/raw/2021/02/05/DueDiligence_flair_DD_090543.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['DD', 'DD', 'GME', 'DFV', 'GME', 'GME', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME']

If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.

Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.

I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.

I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use .

Hello everyone I’m sort of new to WSB sub I’m not an OG of the sub but I’m an OG of Reddit & I used to watch the WSB sub from afar as it wasn’t something I felt like I wanted to dive into so I didn’t actively follow this sub until recently. 

My post in the WSB today gathered lots of attention to my surprise 

28k it shows me liked my post and with that came a flood of messages from our fellow tards one who wants to stay unknown and one who wasnt permitted to post on WSB yet. 


The first message is as follows 

I have a point that needs to be heard. But can't post as i'm new here.

I work in finance sector. I am a PI on etoro, don't tell anyone as I want to remain anonymous.

People are losing hope. But the squeeze is nearly here. Holding the line is not enough & may not activate the squeeze.

Looking at the data, the price dropping do to supply and demand issues. People are not buying enough. This means price drops = fear, more people sell.

120% are still short with more contracts set to expire on Friday. If the price increase to $150-200 I belie the squeeze would be hit as the new contracts would cause this.

As it stands, the margins are not being called and they appear to be winning. ALL YOU NEED IS TO HOLD & PUSH ONCE MORE FOR THE SHORT SQUEEZE.

This is just my personal view. But maybe it should be heard.

I believe that I can share this view with you since I have the same experience as any Harvard or Yale grad has when they join a wall street hedge fund. 

Instead the media and hedge funds taking WSB investors for dead. It would be a good strategy to make a very public statement that WSB is here to stay. The top two stocks that the media connects WSB with is GME and AMC. While it would be awesome it where GME, its just too expensive. 

Any investor who has the ability and wants to believe that WSB can be a hedge fund for the masses the best way to do so is by converting GME stock to AMC. Right now roughly 1 GME = 5 AMC stocks. Anybody who would follow this strategy that owns GME would increase their leverage 5X against the AMC shorts. This strategy is not just about those that own GME if there are autists who don't own GME they would still benefit buying the stock as it is cheaper than pre pandemic levels. The timing of this strategy is good. This is at the end of the week which means that whoever is managing their shorts are going to rebalance for the next week. (research pending) This is a perfect time to force the short squeeze.

I think GME was around $17.10 a share when I seriously began considering jumping into the game... Unfortunately?/Fortunately? I decided I was a baby Ape and that I should watch as the bigger Apes take the fight to the man... Holy Fuck has it been a ride so far... Several times have both kicked myself in the ass for not getting in and thanked myself for procrastinating....

One thing my smooth-dumb-ass-ape Brain did not think about was whom is king of the jungle? u/DeepFuckingValue, aka, Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty on the utoobs..... 

After reading post after post after post after spam after post, I finally came across his name, Mr. Keith Gill.  (Ape earns first wrinkle...)

After getting Jungle boss name, Ape types King’s name into the gooooogle mashine.... Ape find toob channel ( Roaring Kitty). (Ape scratches wrinkle....)

Ape press clicky pictures and hears jungle king explain wordy things about tendies.... 

Ape now have 2 wrinkles...

All Joking aside, I am certain I belong here as it took me this long to do this. I would like to encourage all the 5Mn new subscribers to this subreddit to do the same, or well, do any research (ape told this called Due Diligence), before they totally blow their 🥜 hoping they can jump on the back of smarter apes...

One day a company disrupted the market and shock the masses: Apple and the Iphone.
It changed the way we use phones, remember those Palm Treo? I had a 680, was cool but the iphone? omg!
then Google partner with HTC to bring their phones to the market, the rest we all know what happened to each company 💀, we lived the race and the battle, it was a OS battle: iOS  vs Android, who won? both, both are still alive, BB, NOK, HTC are gone, now the new battle forming is on the EV space and now is time to make ""SmartCars"" Tesla slipped under both Google and Apple and now they both can see the potential of the upcoming events AKA 💵,.
-Apple + Hyundai +Canoo
VS
-Google + Ford
VS
-Tesla

The rest players are the ones who will pick up the crumbles.
Whatever side you pick is a win, for me I'll be investing... INVESTING... Long term, 10 years, NO pump and dump, no BS 🚀 and moon dumb shit fake bull runs, this is like buying apple before the iphone and the same to the rest of the companies.

I will start off with saying none of this is financial advice, I can't even afford Excel.

That said, yesterday I copied the data from both Quandl(Data from Finra) and Fintel, just to see if they correlate and what percentage of trades are done through Finra registered traders. In the end it didn't seem to be relevant, or was prone to confirmation bias.
The only thing I noticed was that the % of trades through Finra increased steadily after the initial rush last week.
Here's the full graph:  
https://i.imgur.com/rCfv3Pw.jpg

So an hour ago I decided to update the graph with 04.02.21 values, and apparently Fintel just updated the way they calculate their Short Volume. Here are all the relevant links for the numbers:  
https://www.quandl.com/data/FINRA/FNYX_GME-FINRA-NYSE-TRF-Short-Interest-GME  
https://www.quandl.com/data/FINRA/FNSQ_GME-FINRA-NASDAQ-TRF-Short-Interest-GME  
https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme

This is where it gets interesting:  
https://i.imgur.com/ATe9Tyl.jpg

As you can see, the Short Volume Ratio increased massively over the last few days according to the new info, up to 69% (nice) on 04.02.21.  Notice also how big the difference gets with each day: from 20% last monday to 45% this tuesday.  
(Don't have old numbers from Fintel for 02.04, but they would be around 13-14 million as the Finra data)

Now I am just a smooth-brained ape, but I thought this was pretty big considering how much their updated short volume changed. The way Fintel got their Short Volume numbers before correlates to Short Volume from Finra, but now the total volume they show is much higher.

Listen up retards: it is mathematically impossible for shorts to be covered by now. If it was possible to cover like that do you think short squeezes would EVER happen? 

It’s simple. Let’s use the worst possible numbers here. 

Jan 15 226% of the 51 million floating shares were shorted. 51 million x 2.26 = 115.26 million shares. Let’s say they shorted the shares at $5. They borrowed at least 576 million dollars worth of stock to do that. Over half a billion just to set up this short. 

Now people are saying they covered by shorting at 300, 400, 500. Ok, let’s say they covered at 300. You’re telling me Melvin was able to come up with 300 x 115.26 = 34.5 billion dollars loan to cover their massive fuck up? Even if they covered HALF the shorts at 100 per share we’re still talking about 5.75 BILLION US DOLLARS JUST TO COVER THEIR ORIGINAL FUCK UP and they would’ve had to fabricate THREE TIMES as many FAKE shares as they did in the first place. Remember 226% short over float? It would have to be 452% now to cover. 

Hold your fucking shares.

Edit: I am not a financial advisor and this post does not constitute financial advice. I used my cell phone calculator to do this math.

Edit 2: I know I shouldn’t be surprised you retards don’t understand simple math but let me try to explain this to you: if I short a stock at $5 and it goes to $100, I owe $95 to the lender. If I short again at $100 and it drops to $5, I made $95. My net gain is a big fat fucking **ZERO**. If I short again at $100 and it goes to $50 my net is 50-95= *-$45* Not to mention the interest rate on that short position, which if I’m getting for less than inflation means the lender is paying me to borrow money. 

Please get your head out of your ass. **if it were possible to cover a short squeeze then a short squeeze would never ever happen. The reason short squeezes happen is BECAUSE THEY CANT COVER.**"|2021-02-05 09:05:41.255002|../output/raw/2021/02/05/DueDiligence_flair_DD_090543.csv|DueDiligence|['GME']|['GME']|['I', 'EVER', 'HALF', 'LLION', 'US', 'LLARS', 'JUST', 'TO', 'COVER', 'THEIR', 'GINAL', 'FUCK', 'UP', 'THREE', 'TIMES', 'FAKE', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'CAUSE', 'THEY', 'CANT', 'COVER']|[]

As long as the popular opinion is that the stock will fall further, it is hard to assume that the shorts have covered.

Source: https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme, date is seen next to the short interest volume.






According to Bloomberg from Feb 1:






>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/gamestop-short-interest-plummets-in-a-sign-traders-are-covering





>Short interest in the video-game retailer plummeted to 39% of free-floating shares, from 114% in mid-January, according to IHS Markit Ltd. data. Data from S3 Partners, another market intelligence firm, showed a similar pattern, with GameStop’s short sales having fallen to about 50% of its total stock available to trade, down from a high of roughly 140% reached earlier this year.








Obviously those are numbers from 2 different market analytics firms so they are not official. NYSE will report official numbers on Feb 9. These Feb. 9 numbers will be the short interest as of Jan. 29 so they won't be as low as the Bloomberg numbers since they're 3 days older (Source: https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/data/NYSE_Group_Short_Interest_Calendar.pdf)






**So, as a summary:**








Officially: 121% on Jan 15, new numbers come out feb 9 (but will be the short interest from Jan 29)








S3: 140% mid Jan, 50% as of Feb. 1







IHS Markit: 114% mid Jan, 39% as of Feb. 1









As much as WSB likes to cast doubt on any information against a potential second squeeze, these firms' whole business depends on providing accurate estimates. There is a very good chance the official short interest will be around 39-50%. But note that it may be slightly higher since the data is 3 days older than those estimates. 






**What does this mean?**




Based on the estimates, there is a 60+% decrease in the number of shorts from Jan 15 to Feb 1. This means short-sellers have covered most of their shorts and the chance of another short squeeze occurring is basically 0. If I had to guess, Melvin covered most of their shorts around Jan 26th (which is when it was reported that they covered). This caused the price to go from $88 to $150. The majority of other short positions were covered between Jan 27-29 which explains the drastic price increase to $300+. 






According to Reuters: 








>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets-idUSKBN29X1SW?taid=6012f37e9ac87d000147d4e3






>Short-sellers are sitting on estimated losses of $70.87 billion from their short positions in U.S. 









>Ortex data showed that as of Wednesday, there were loss-making short positions on more than 5,000 U.S. firms.





My prediction makes sense with these numbers. Melvin lost $6 billion and were spared from heavier losses due to how quickly they bought to cover. This demand drove the price up and caused most of the remaining losses.













**EDIT:**





**Here is my response to /u/OverlordHippo's comment about the S3 numbers:**





>Except the S3 data was only 54% because they added synthetic longs into their equation this time for (some) no reason. Using the common practice equation it's still well over 100%. If you think Bloomberg is reporting with integrity, well I can't help you there lol






Let's look at the S3 report for Feb 1: https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356261806612885509




You will see 2 different values for the short interest: 




53.15% SI % Float








34.1% S3 SI % Float





The 53% number is calculated how short interest is typically calculated. S3 did NOT add synthetic longs into this equation. 




The 34.1% number is the number which includes synthetic longs. The managing director of S3 explains the difference between this two numbers and why this is done back in September 2020: https://www.shortsight.com/short-interest-of-float-2-0/






**The confusion about S3 stems from this Tweet from Jan 29:** 
https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755





From Jan 29 to Feb 1, traditional short interest went from 113.31% to 53.15%.






And, S3 short interest (the calculation which included synthetic longs) went from 53.12% to 34.71%. 








**People confused the** traditional short interest **of** 53.15% **from Feb. 1 with the** S3 short interest **of** 53.12% **from Jan 29. They thought the traditional short interest used a new calculation when it did not. S3 did NOT change the calculation randomly.**"|2021-02-05 09:05:41.255002|../output/raw/2021/02/05/DueDiligence_flair_DD_090545.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['IHS', 'NYSE', 'IHS', 'WSB', 'I', 'SW', 'U', 'S', 'U', 'S', 'I', 'SI', 'SI', 'NOT', 'NOT']|['IHS', 'IHS']

And that is an ear to the ground of the general public.  This is winded, but worth a read as it's a minority thesis.

I am not a financial advisor, I am not a finance person.  I am nothing more than a low stakes poker player with a mere BA in Economics.  And this is not financial advice.  It's simply my thesis and my play.

I was aware of the theory of GME when it was around $11.  I had no clue if it was real or not. I saw the 140% short.  I honestly thought it was a mistake or something.  After, GME dipped from $20 to $16, I was about to throw a few bucks in and see where the Cohen theory went, and if a squeeze happened great. But, then the capital attack happened and I was concerned and was sitting on 90% cash.  So I pulled to my bank till after Jan 20th.  Then, after I re-deposited and behold, GME is at like $50-60. Well damn, so I felt I had missed the boat.

Then something happened, GME rocketed to $120, and all the talking heads on TV started to squirm, billionaires were on TV comparing reddit to cop killers from the capital attack.  The gears of the elite machine started to turn and I called my buddy and said, you know what, it's real, this mfer is going to moon, their borrowed to the fucking gills, maybe even more than we realize. So I looked at my financial situation and chose an amount to put to work on this and decided to dollar cost avg in.  The next day we got a $73 dip. I was in.   We rebound off $73, and then Elon tweets on a move up when GME was $149, it opens the next morning at $260.  That really sucked Mr. Musk, thanks.   So I have skin in the game and am not prepared to make any more moves after that kind of move up. So I wait and watch.  We get a few small dips and I dip a few more dollars in before this thing moves to the stratosphere.  Still only approx  15% in at this point.

Que GME moving into $400 range.  All the news outlets are starting to talk now, it's on a bunch of stuff, CNBC is trying to ignore it, talking about MSFT moving 3%, trying to ignore the elephant in the room.  Boomers around town start talking about, they are asking me questions about what's going on. But they all say the same thing.....if that gets back to around $50, I'm going to buy some.  GME moves toward $500.  The talking heads can't ignore it anymore, the stock market starts bleeding, their pleading with people to stop, the president is getting asked about it, congress is getting in, my dog is fucking watching the TV to see whats about to happen, the super bowl isn't even being talked about amongst gamblers, the whole world is looking at GME, and boomers are asking if they should buy at $500.  And that is when it hit me.  This could crash the economy.

During this move from $260 to $500, I started to notice trends setting in at $360, $330, and $283. It was really struggling to get over the $360 hump, checked the market cap, $22 billion I think.  I told my friend, I don't think the retail guy has enough money.  A guy on CNBC said maybe friday morning, (ok, so they are going to try to crash the entire market, what price do we have to get to?  40 billion?)  So I looked at what GME is at 40 billion, It's $573 if I remember correctly.   So when we were at 22 billion, I asked myself, where is the other half going to come from, it has to be people with cash, and they are terrified of these prices.  Why would they put the majority stake in at $30k for maybe a 100% return, when a guy with $1000 in takes 11,000%.  The avg joe isn't buying this here, it's going to have to crash before it squeezes, if this isn't the squeeze, and these people up big are going to start taking profits.

To my suprise, it breaks into the $500 range, the markets are literally fucking tanking on positive vaccine news as this thing moves toward that $571 number.  I tell my buddy, this is exactly what I said would happen at these prices. So did I sell, hell no, this thing was about to pop.  Then RH happened.

At first, I went conspiracy level shit and thought did they just fucking stop the economy from crashing by doing something illegal, what is this, communist China?  But then it made more sense, people had borrowed on the margin to push it this high that fast, and RH literally wouldn't have the cash to pay these fucking people, which reinforced everything I am thinking at this point.  Friday closes at $320.  The boomers are all talking GME now as a deal at these prices, but their scared, their old, they have to retire soon.  Que Monday morning Silver.

Monday morning Silver squeeze was not ""put out there"" to divert attention of young people from GME.  It was to divert the boomer to the thing they love most, good old metals.  They pushed an ad campaign to get boomers to think, we havn't missed out, these youngsters are about to push silver to the moon and even if they don't, metals are safe, metals are good for the boomer retirement. So now all the boomers are talking Silver. And that is when I made adjustments to my dollar cost avg'ng. This thing was going to crash, there wasn't enough money to push it over the top without getting cash holders and boomers in. I am a cash holder they needed, I wasn't coming in at $300, the boomer was not with you, and the profit takers were up huge and the pressure was on them.   So I sold at $325, with the plan to double down on the way down to $60, double again at $60,  and then double again at $50, with hopes that the boomer would see $50 as a chance to get in and we would see a bounce off $50.   They moved the silver market nearly 10% Monday, over a 1 trillion dollar market.

Well now it's today.  And guess what.  Boomers are not talking Silver in the streets, their talking GME at $50, cash holders are not talking AAPL, their talking GME, and gamblers are still not talking about the Super Bowl, their talking GME.  Their talking about feeling like they were lied to by the media about Silver.  They heard Cramer tell Reddit to not go for the grandslam, go for the homerun instead, take your profits.  They know the establishment squirmed and they don't squirm over a lame 20 billion loss.  A curtain was almost pulled back, and a lot of people are sure curious about what was behind that curtain at $573.

And what is wall street doing.  Celebrating.  Enjoying it.  Doubling down on puts.  It's Atlanta 28-NE 7 with 3 minutes to go in the 3rd QT in the Super Bowl.  It's over. The billionaire owner is on the sideline waiting for his trophy.

But what if there is a spark.  A tiny bounce off $50.  A dropped pass that gives the ball back to save a glimmer of hope.

Boomer sees price going back up, gambler sees price moving back up, cash holder sees price moving.  Downside, probably 50%, upside huge.  A buy, then another, momentum maybe?  Probably not, some holders see a new opportunity to bail, price falls, and yet another buying opportunity to open the curtain.  Another buy, another buy, no sellers at these levels, they have had 5 opportunities to bail.  Momentum builds. The news starts talking again, rolling their eyes, people start to think, it's happening.  More come in, process repeats, until there is enough momentum, some profit takers start thinking, what if I am wrong, if I put in 50% profits, I've still got 50%.  And to the moon we go to open a magic curtain with something behind it that makes everyone nervous for some reason.

Or, maybe we just crash to $5.

So what I have been betting on is simple.  Wall Street is amazing at this game. But they are not on the street, they don't have their ear to ground. I believe that they played this perfect, just like I expected them to.  And I am betting they have underestimated this and have doubled down again without the knowledge of the talk on the streets, being around regular people, thinking this forum was their biggest threat, and have in the process overextended themselves in the process again.

Do I think they are still heavily shorted.  HELL YES.  Do I think the economy is at risk.  No.  They likely deleveraged enough to remove that option by reducing some of their own risk.  But another $?bn loss is a lot of tendies to go around.

I know this is very hard to digest guys, but please remember that in the markets, you are in for yourself, not for wallstreetbets, not for anybody. There is a saying: there are no friends in wall street.

Holding now, thinking that it will be just like VW in 2008 is insane, the VW dip was caused by shorts! This is why the squeeze in VW even happened. 

Short interest in GME is at about 50%, which is not bad, but most of the shorts now are probably shorts that shorted after the original shorters bought back, meaning that these shorts are in the money right now.

Also, GME is recovering a bit as a company, going into ecommerce, getting Ryan on board, but even the current price 60$ is not justifiable for a company such as gamestop.

If you need the money, I would highly suggest you sell, but if you want to be a retard and let your 30%, 40%, 50% loss get into a 90% loss, you might as well do it.

I personally didn't invest in GME, and I am not shorting it right now, but beware of people shaming you for selling ""paper hands"", ""weak hands"", don't be shamed into losing your money.

tl;dr: Don't hold if you still want money, the squeeze is done, those with diamond hands are on track to lose money, and if you can be shamed by reddit into holding, you're a retard."|2021-02-05 09:05:41.255002|../output/raw/2021/02/05/DueDiligence_flair_DD_090545.csv|DueDiligence|['GME']|['GME']|['I', 'VW', 'VW', 'VW', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME']

TLDR: Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered. Full version below.

There’s an insightful piece on [https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) that identifies there are two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.

First way is retail investors not holding the line and panic selling thereby driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.

Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out… Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.

\*\*

However the other scenario where this can occur is the hedge fund short interest in GME didn’t really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further “breaking the squeeze.”

\*\*

To now quote verbatim from Tradesmithdaily:

The way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market.

The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013.

The SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.” You can [read it here via the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).

The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here’s a quick rundown:

* If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.
* A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.
* The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.
* This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.
* As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.
* The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.

It gets very complicated, very fast.

But the gist is that hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered, and can’t, for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.

Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:

*“Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.*”

\*\*

In short (no pun intended) these tricks “help hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren’t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located”, which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)) and Michael Burry’s (now deleted tweet viewable here [https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en)) about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.

These factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren’t really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to “cover” short positions that they shouldn’t have had to begin with because shares were never properly located.

Separately but potentially related, S3 released updated short numbers last Sunday reducing from their projection of short interest from 122% to 113% (a day later on Friday) to 55% on Sunday (while markets were closed therefore in my estimation using the same data set that calculated 113%), which many found to be suspicious. Later it was found that this new number was calculated using the same data set that yielded 122% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of adding synthetic long shares into the short float equation which is against standard practice.

For a more detailed breakdown a user here pasted a good analysis of how those numbers were reached [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read\_this\_they\_are\_screwed\_numbers\_dont\_lie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/)

\*\*

Excerpt:

The real short % according to S3's data is 122%. However, their 55% figure is technically not a lie, but extremely misleading. I will explain everything.

Here is what they did:Sources (S3 head):[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355990194575564801?s=19](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355990194575564801?s=19)[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356004816414269448)[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355969693841051650](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355969693841051650)

S3 head is redefining share float to include shares that don't exist in order to be able to say shorted % of float is lower.

it reduces the traditional SI % Float, Instead of Shares Shorted/Float our calc is Shares Shorted/ (Float + Shares Shorted)

So, by this definition, if a stock is shorted 400% of existing shares (total banana count borrowed and resold 4x) and total shares is 100, short % is calculated like this:400 shorts / (100 shares + 400 longs whose shares are borrowed) = 0.8That is, the normal way we define short % would say it's 400% shorted. S3's way says 80%.

Knowing this formula, we can work back to what S3 would have said the short % of float was using the normal definition of short % of float:55% short of float means for all existing shares + shorts (or, ont he other side of the trade ""longs whose shares were borrowed away to short"") is 55/45 as much as existing shares. Meaning, portion of shares short by the normal definition (% of existing bananas borrowed) is 55/45 = 1.22

That is, S3's data is telling them that after friday trading, GME is still 122% short.

\*\*

Many have pointed out this could be manipulation on S3’s part. It’s interesting to note that as late as the Jan 29th, Ihor from S3 stated most GME shorts have not covered and net shares shorted hadn't moved much at all ([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314)). Initially on the 28th he claimed short interest float to be $122 ([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1354847896173240322](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1354847896173240322)). The next day he claimed short interest to be 113% ([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755)) of float. 2 days later on Sunday, S3 released a report on the calculated short interest to be 55% (oddly their original announcement tweet appears deleted, but found this [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897)), which was confusing to many as this was a big discrepancy in short percentage in a short time. It turned out this percentage was calculated by including synthetic longs into the equation which is a practice that is not standard, thereby yielding a lower short interest percentage of 55% which the media then bandied around before and during market open on Monday. Whether this involved collusion to harm the retail investor I cannot conclusively say as I don’t have the evidence to conclusively make that claim, but definitely something to consider along with all other data points.

With the possibility of Synthetic Long Shares being used in a fraudulent way, if you care about how this could play out if we force the issue, I would recommend you to follow instructions from this comment [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how\_gme\_can\_still\_be\_a\_great\_play/gm2tsnw/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/gm2tsnw/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and call or email Gamestop Investor Relations and ask them to call an emergency share holder meeting to save the company from bankruptcy, as calling this vote means calling shares back to owners eliminating all synthetic stock, and hence taking leverage away from short selling funds participating in fraudulent activity

Long post ahead, but I encourage you to read the whole thing.

TLDR: Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered. Full version below.

There’s an insightful piece on [https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) that identifies there are two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.

First way is retail investors not holding the line and panic selling thereby driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.

\*\*

Quoting from Tradesmithdaily:

Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out… Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.

The next day he claimed short interest to be 113% ([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755)) of float. 2 days later on Sunday, S3 released a report on the calculated short interest to be 55% (oddly their original announcement tweet appears deleted, but found this [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356392101806800897)), which was confusing to many as this was a big discrepancy in short percentage in a short time. It turned out this percentage was calculated by including synthetic longs into the equation which is a practice that is not standard, thereby yielding a lower short interest percentage of 55% which the media then bandied around before and during market open on Monday. Whether this involved collusion to harm the retail investor I cannot conclusively say as I don’t have the evidence to conclusively make that claim, but definitely something to consider along with all other data points.

With the possibility of Synthetic Long Shares being used in a fraudulent way, if you care about how this could play out if we force the issue, I would recommend you to follow instructions from this comment [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how\_gme\_can\_still\_be\_a\_great\_play/gm2tsnw/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/gm2tsnw/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and call or email Gamestop Investor Relations and ask them to call an emergency share holder meeting to save the company from bankruptcy, as calling this vote means calling shares back to owners eliminating all synthetic stock, and hence taking leverage away from short selling funds participating in fraudulent activity

As a result, they've amassed quite a few things along the way.  They currently have approx 5M sq ft green house in TX and 5M in BC Canada as well as several partners in CAD/US/Mex (approx 12M sq ft of growing space).  On top of that, they've been selling to all the major grocery chain (Loblaw, Safeway, Trader Joes, Walmart, Wholefoods, etc. for years).  On top of that, they have decades of experience navigating the regulatory obstacles that is the USDA.

Why is all this relevant you ask?  Why should you give a shit about a vegetable grower who was able survive for 30yrs on razor thin margins (\~3-5%)?  Because they are pivoting to Cannabis and making a splash.  They operate their cannabis division in Canada under the name Pure Sunfarms and have curretly dedicated 2 of the 5M sq ft space to it and able to grow more as necessary.

All numbers in USD

Low 2.07, High 15.05

Q4/FY20 ER expected - My service say 2/16 but they've traditionally released it mid March

&#x200B;

TLDR;

\- Only profitable Public LP in Canada (not squint real hard adjusted ebitda profitable, but actual fcf/net income profitable)

\- Grossly undervalued compared to their peers (by marketcap)

\- Recently came in 4th for retail sales in Ontario only after 1yr of receiving their sales license compared with other LP's having years head start.  They hold the pole position for flower sales (by brand) at OCS online

\- Lowest cost producer (can grow at \~.45/g and all in cost around .60/g)

\- CEO/founder owns about 13%+ of all the shares

\- Large LPs (like ACB) have pretty much given up on growing in bulk and buying from them wholesale b/c it's cheaper

\- Already have US presence

Profitability

Check any LP on ycharts and you can see most LPs have been losing money since day 1 compared with VFF.  It's patently absurd how poorly these companies are run.

Grossly Undervalued 

Given all the money losing companies, we have (from YHOO finance):

APHA - 5.2B

VFF - 1.15B

Sales Performance

4th on retail sales per[ https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235](https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235)

\#1 dried flower on ocs online[ https://ocs.ca/pages/insights-publication](https://ocs.ca/pages/insights-publication)

Again, all this only after 1yr of receiving their sales licenses.

Lowest cost producers

As noted, they had to survive for years on razor thing vegetable margins so they've learned a thing or two about growing things cheaply.  While other LP's were spending millions/billions building/acquiring space, VFF quietly and efficiently converted their existing greenhouses for growing cannabis with the single goal in mind of producing it as cheaply as possible realizing that cannabis is just another commodity.  They've since stopped publishing their costs to produce for competitive reasons but left it last year in the .4-.5/g range and recently said they feel they could do it much cheaper based on tech advancements and picking out strains.  To punctuate their commitment to low cost operation, they have their own power plant recycling methane from a nearby dump site and converting it into power.  A recent comment by the CEO said that the nearest competitor spends roughly 2x more to produce 1g of cannabis.  That is huge!

CEO owns about 10M shares of the 75M shares outstanding.  First, 75M shares outstanding (about 65M float) is peanuts compare to the to others (maybe a little off given some <cough> ACB <cough> like to dilute every other week)

APHA - 317M

CGC - 374M

ACB - 160M (after a 12:1 reverse split else they'd be 2B+)

TLRY - 160M

So CEO owns about 13% of the company and is therefore majorly aligned with shareholders.  The management is top notch only diluting when absolutely necessary and aren't writing down 10's of millions/billions of assets like these other guys.

Wholesaler

As it turns out, being able to grow at low cost not only gives you the ability to dictate market prices in the retail channels (their products are generally the lowest prices around and they're still able to make a profit), but it affords them the opportunity to uniquely dominate the wholesale channel.  In fact, wholesale made up roughly 50% of their revs last Quarter!  As noted, ACB has all but given up on growing their own weed favoring buying it on the wholesale market (from VFF) b/c it's actually cheaper for them?  Huh?

US Presence

Let's face it, the US market will be YUGE.  If Canada, with it's 35M inhabitants, is projected to be a 5-10B market, you can multiply that by at least a factor of 10 for the US with its 350M peeps.  Everyone and their brother is vying for a spot there.  VFF already has a 5M sq ft greenhouse in TX and has said that they can enter the market once the States Act is passed.  Guess what?  Congress is currently working on that to make it a reality:[ https://mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/](https://mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/)

On top of which, they have a small investment in a company working the ASIA market.  I actually think this will be another dominant market consider how much these guys smoke (where do you think all the cigarette revs are coming from these days now that the it's no longer hip to smoke in the US?)

(Mods, whoever they are deleting my quality DD posts for no reason... Just trying to help you guys look at solid plays in the market . No reason to delete & ban, I always show proof of position & all companies are SOLID!

A LOT has changed in the last week, as you all know... 5M plus new users here & getting good DD posts on undervalued plays are harder than ever to sift through & find.

So **Without further ado... My next potential 10 bagger is $U-W-M-C previously...** Please keep in mind this is the **LARGEST S** transaction to ever take place\*\*; valued over $16 Billion dollars!\*\*

As many of you know who follow me - I post clear & concise due diligence posts & expect everyone to make their own decision when entering or exiting a trade. Those of you who are not familiar with **United Wholesale Mortgage (The #1 wholesale and purchase mortgage lender in the U.S.**), I will give you a brief overview below:

\- Founded in 1986 and based in Pontiac, Michigan, U W M C is the largest wholesale mortgage originator in the United States with nearly 8,000 dedicated team members. UWM’s differentiated business model focuses exclusively on providing wholesale mortgage clients superior service through proprietary technology that enables them to process mortgage applications at faster speeds and provide lower rates than competitors.

Currently trading at **$10.19, U - W - MC is grossly undervalued**. Just a month ago the stock was trading north of $14 & has been manipulated downward for tutes to load back up. My near time price targets are as follows: **Short term: $20+/share. Long term: $35+/Share.** No reason this shouldn't be a 20+ stock already IMO. **🚀🚀🚀**

**Catalysts / Positive Notes:**

* Earnings posted Wednesday, February 3, 2021. Blew out expectations - $1.002B vs $108.72M in same quarter LAST YEAR! $54.7 BILLION IN TOTAL LOAN VOLUME. 71% increase. 🚀
* Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC acted as financial advisor. 🚀
* Deutsche Bank Securities and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC acted as lead financial advisors 🚀
* With the Fed keeping rates low for the foreseeable future, mortgage lenders are poised for further growth. Real estate buying is soaring!! 🚀
* Institutional ownership now sits at **81.57%**... Follow the BIG $$$. 🚀
* No 1 in USA already. Expanding overseas. They are going to F-ing BLOW up.
* Same exact management team as Luminar ($L - AZR) - Remember that one? HA! 🚀
* Issuing a 4% annual stock dividend. This should get boomers all fired up. Also, shows an immense amount of confidence in their financials & future growth.
* Award - Winners in several categories by Top Workplace USA in Leadership, Communication & Innovation.

Quick competitive analysis - R - KT trading around 21$ (spiked till 40$ after merger). UWM is a much better company in terms of management/ reviews/ Glassdoor/ CSAT score/ future growth prospects analysis (check yahoo analysis).

**Quick look at Financials:**

* If you are looking at their EBITDA, they have consistent growth over the last 3 years. It is expected to grow significantly over the coming years, especially with overseas development.
* In the most recent Quarter (Q3), UWM raked in $1.45B net income. They had 81% year-over-year increase in loan volume, at $54.2B.
* Reported **$2 Billion** in net income on $3.1 Billion in **revenue** for the first 9 months of 2020 ending in Sept. 30. That dwarfs its performance of $266 million on $883 million in **revenue** during the same nine-month period in 2019. Are you seeing this ABSURD GROWTH POTENTIAL?!?!

**TL/DR** : As always, **Fearful** when **others** are greedy, and greedy when **others are fearful**. **Buy shares of this stock.** Strong conviction play for me on this one. This is an easy double IMO with limited downside risk & many, MANY positive catalysts in the next few days... 🚀🚀🚀🚀

I have had many bags in my hands throughout my life. Of many types, shapes and colors. The vast majority of them were empty. Others I filled over the years with things I grew fond of, and ended up loving even the bag that contained them. But as a poor person, my bags usually have a pretty basic use: they serve to carry things and in the end they end up empty and forgotten, given their ridiculous price and the huge amount of them that exist.

During the last few days I am living a curious situation: I got a pack of recyled bags that I like. I've been using them for a few days and I'm happy. But people around me keep telling me that my bags are empty and worthless. The pack cost me 3 dollars. But they want me to sell the bags to them for a few cents, because they insist that they are worthless, and that if I keep them my personal economy will lose out. They say they are only looking out for my best interest. And, honestly, if I analyze my new bags... those criticisms seem to be right... after all, they are just colorful bags, like any other. Maybe I should sell those bags.

But what I find so strange about all this... is that no one has ever, ever in my life, been interested in an empty bag in my hands."|2021-02-05 09:05:41.255002|../output/raw/2021/02/05/DueDiligence_flair_DD_090545.csv|DueDiligence|['GME', 'I']|['GME']|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']|[]

**\~Very Long Post\~ \[Don't Read Unless You Like DD\]**

Hello everyone! Let’s start by talking a little about [Alphabet](https://imgur.com/TCH8JFz) , they are one of the biggest companies in the world that generates most of their revenues and income from online advertising services provided through their platforms like Google Search & YouTube while also expanding into multiple other businesses like cloud services and autonomous driving technology through their venture Waymo.

The company was founded in 1998 and has more than 130K employees, with the company performing quite well in the past year gaining more than 30%.

I believe Google will continue to [grow](https://imgur.com/WPLBZGp) as their cloud platform will remain one of the biggest in the world, while also continuing to innovate and develop other emerging businesses that might turn out successful in the long-term, while their main competition is Baidu & Bing for the search engine, but their market share is still completely dominant, as they also compete with social networks & online retailers for advertising placements.

So, guys, let’s go a little through the 4th quarter & yearly results for Google.

Google smashed [earnings](https://imgur.com/AgJQqMp) expectations for the 4th quarter with a beat of more than $6 on EPS and $4B in total revenues.🚀

The company [reported](https://imgur.com/blojVXA) a revenue of almost $57B in the 4th quarter while generating revenues of over $182B in 2020, representing a 12% increase over 2019 as they operating income also grew to over $40B for the first time despite a very slow start to the year through the first 2 quarters as their ad revenues were crushed due to the lack of travel & other leisure industries as those are some of the biggest advertiser income streams for them.

The company sustained a significant growth rate in the past year in their 2 major income segments, with their services business which grew by 11%, and the cloud services which also more than doubled their revenues, but the cloud services is still losing money as they keep investing into expanding their services to compete with the other major cloud players like Amazon, Microsoft & Alibaba.

The [company](https://imgur.com/yhnZZSo) has also started this quarter to report their google cloud results separately to give a more detailed view on how the company is performing, as we can now see how the company has managed to increase their revenues streams and how big the YouTube Ads revenues have become for them as those increased by 30% in the last year. Meanwhile the revenues from Google Search also rose by 6% and the Cloud Segment spiked by 46%, as they also have a big backlog in this segment.

So [overall](https://imgur.com/ZRQtD3X), the company has managed to increase their revenues in constant currency by 14% in the past year while also improving their operating margin by 2%.

Google has managed to keep growing and improving their business operation through major capital expenditures that have accounted for over $22B in 2020. I believe the big spending on capex is really needed, as the competition in the cloud segment in really heating up, so I like companies that keep reinvesting into themselves, as they have also spent over $27B on [R&D](https://imgur.com/5DK8IPa) in 2020, as they keep investing into most of their products and adding new ones in the pipeline.

Also, for the projections of the discounted free cash flow it’s important to [NOTE](https://imgur.com/m5R4niH) that they had over $13B in Depreciation & Amortization in 2020, with this number growing between 15-30% in the past 2 years so I while use a 15% increase for the projections to be safe. The other big number that is important is their overall capex spending, which has gone down in the past 3 years, but as things might ramp up again as they mentioned in their earnings call, I will continue to grow this spending by 2.5%/year expecting things to normalize after the company went for a safer approach in 2020.

[Alphabet](https://imgur.com/jy9opVV) also managed to increase their earnings before interest & tax or EBIT which stood at over $41B while also buying back 1.6% of their total shares in the past year, as they continued buyback [programs](https://imgur.com/wJ8x2BD) in the 4th quarter of 2020, buying back over 4.7M shares in just the last 3 months, thus continuing to reward their shareholders even more

There are a couple of negative outlooks for the company though, as their [effective](https://imgur.com/z2YDQhh) tax rate has increased in the past years, and this might continue to go higher depending on future tax reforms so I will take into account some small raises in the tax rate.

The next problem is the regulatory pressure which can be another bump in the road for Google, but I mostly expect things to drag along and may eventually end with something similar to what happened to Microsoft. Even If they somehow end up breaking their businesses, I think we can see the Cloud business trading at insane P/Es which would increase the actual value of the resulting stocks, while the search engine and YouTube will remain very powerful even without the contracts with OEMs, which would result in better margins and less operating expenses, as most people would still turn to Google for their searches and videos.

The final problem for Google is the privacy issues, but it seems they have found a way to substitute the traditional cookie technology with a new software interface called Federated Learning of [cohorts](https://imgur.com/SumQGc9).

This technology seems to have at least 95% of the same power of conversion per dollar compared to cookies which would be a huge boost to their privacy issues concerns and will help them maintain their dominance in the online ad’s world

But this isn’t the only technology Alphabet is trying to develop, they still have other proposals in works as well, which might come in even better, so we will have to wait and see what they go with.

Meanwhile, Google also offered some [guidance](https://imgur.com/OcOg89t) for 2021 as they expect easy comps in the first half of 2021, while they are planning to ramp up the pace of investments this year.

They also expect to keep investing in cloud segment as their [backlog](https://imgur.com/ypuUDWt) which stands at $30B is mostly attributable to the cloud segment, as Alphabet will continue to focus on long-term growth that will benefit them in the long run as operating results & margins go.

For the price targets, I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on…

So, let’s start with the discounted free cash flow [PROJECTIONS](https://imgur.com/0JTwpv2) to see what the current valuation of the company is.

I used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later in the long-term projection, and the net income for 2020, to which I added back the Depreciation & Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to an EBITDA of almost $55B

For the next years I used a small increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and also applied a 10% decrease in their net working capital.

I increased the capex spending and their D&A as I previously mentioned, so, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the average SP500 return in the past decades and is what I like to use as a discount rate, given the current low interest rates, we get almost $190B Discounted Free Cash Flows by 2025.

Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt of the company, which in this case stand at a net $200B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though most of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach.

If we do use the growth approach, we can see that GOOG is slightly overvalued right now, as this implies a loss of about 5%.

On the other hand, a good EBITDA multiple for the company I think is about 20, as the stock currently trades over this multiple, but for safety reasons, I think 20 is pretty reasonable.

And given this multiple & approach we get a valuation of over $2700, or a 32% undervaluation of the company.

But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for Alphabet in 2021 is $2326, implying a 13.3% return from the last price 🚀

Guys, next let’s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for Google.

For my [PROJECTIONS](https://imgur.com/ZcwoWyP) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream.

I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the Cloud segment for 2021 as businesses keep needing cloud services more & more, and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth rate

For the Google Services (which include Search, YouTube & other revenue streams) I implied a 12% growth, just above last years, as YouTube keeps booming and the leisure industry advertising will slowly come back. But, for reasonable purposes I also implied a gradual slowdown of this trend by 1% each year

I believe these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high market share in the search segment and the demand for cloud services platforms.

The 2 other revenues streams which are Other Bets & Hedging I pretty much left unchanged as they don’t really have that big implications on the final number, but I did add a small amount of growth in both of them.

For their cost of sales, I started from the current ones and maintained them for 3 of their segments, while for the Google Cloud cost of sales I implied a gradual improvement of about 14%/year. So, I am implying they reach profitability by 2024 and reach somewhat of an AWS type of profitability by 2025.

Guys, if we add all of these up, it means for 2025 we would get over $334B in revenues and $237B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $97B.

I also [maintained](https://imgur.com/2MTh00j) the same capex as in the cash flow projections while for the interest income & other incomes which stood at [almost](https://imgur.com/ru1SwIX) $7B this year I implied small annual growths, thus leading us to a $75.4B in earnings before tax.

I also slightly [increased](https://imgur.com/78E0QSN) their 16.3% effective tax rate to about 17.5% by 2025 in order to somewhat account for possible tax changes in the future and also accounted for some share buyback programs of about 1% each year.

So, for the $62B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 653M shares, that would mean a $95.25 earnings/share, meaning the [stock](https://imgur.com/eSnDXEP) is trading at almost 22 times forward price to earnings for 2025.

Guys, for my personal projections I like to use Forward/PE valuations & multiples, so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $2381 and $3810

After all these estimates what are my price targets?

[HERE](https://imgur.com/Bz3AiJx) are my actual price targets… I think the 2025 bear case price we can see Google trade at is $2619 which would imply a return of 27.5%, while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Google will trade at 3095$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 50% return on the current price.

My most bullish case though, would see the company trading at $3572, which would imply a return of almost 74%. 🚀

So yeah guys, these are my Overall price [TARGETS](https://imgur.com/ZZ9i4sP) for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 & 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE’s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40.

I think these are pretty reasonable targets, as the cloud services will continue to boom in the next decades, while they will also benefit from an increased reach for their search engine and booming YouTube platform as more people are getting internet access each day, and we shouldn’t forget that they might have even more great products in the pipeline with interesting names like Waymo.

Alphabet also has very good [financials](https://imgur.com/l6B9Qi0), with almost $320B in assets vs just $97B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by the current $137B in cash, cash equivalents & marketable securities

I also like to take a look at what the estimates are from the other analysts, and in this case, we can see an average EPS [estimate](https://imgur.com/Yjf1Cnh) by 2025 of $117, which is way higher than my $95 EPS estimates.

The analysts also expect over $370B in total [revenues](https://imgur.com/JKn4LIJ) on average, which is also more than $35B ahead of where my targets are pointing, so, I think it’s safe to say I have been pretty conservative & reasonable with the growth expectations for the company.

You are probably wondering, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for GOOGLE?

Let’s start by taking a look at this [CHART](https://imgur.com/1qXT9uv), we can see that Google was trading in an increasingly tighter wedge formation since the September lows. Right now, after smashing the earnings report the company has re-entered overbought territory with an RSI of over 70, which we haven’t seen since the big September sell-off. This breakout from this wedge formation came on the back of massive volumes for the stock, so I believe we can see the overbought conditions push the stock lower in the near-term before eventually going back even higher as I expect with my $2326 prediction for the end of the year.

I also think the $1920 to $1935 range can act as future support after it was a good resistance point for the stock

But, let’s also take a quick look at what 44 analysts on Wall Street are [saying](https://imgur.com/AVfkNAo). They are mostly very bullish on the stock with an average price target of $2171 and a high price target of $2610. So, guys, I think the analyst still have some catching up to do with upgrades to the stock after the recent earnings report.

Are you asking yourself, what would I do?

I believe it still has plenty of room to [grow](https://imgur.com/T6YxgoP), so I would start building a position if the stock drops under $2000 and especially buy more if it goes to the previous resistance levels between $1920 and $1935

I also believe that the big % of their shares held by [institutions](https://imgur.com/CaBNOHd), with over 72% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard & Blackrock does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities and increase the support levels power.

So, these are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Google has a terrific future ahead, with their market [share](https://imgur.com/aCYlMkK) of engine search worldwide crushing the competition and the hole digital ad spending worldwide [forecasted](https://imgur.com/Pc53mtL) to continue to grow and take share of the total ad spending worldwide.

I believe Google will remain one of the best companies in the world while also being a good catch-up play to the other big tech names, as Google has underperformed [compared](https://imgur.com/lcKbD0T) to most of the other big names with the exception of Facebook.

""The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.

By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.""

Please poke holes in this and berate me so I can be reminded not to speak out of turn.

To keep a long story short, everyone's waiting on FINRA to update short interest data on Feb 9th. I don't know if that's the only source for that data, but someone noticed [here]( https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ShortPercentageOfFloat/gme/Short-Percentage-Of-Float) that it showed 292% short percentage of float. This is a higher percentage than FINRA's most recent update in January. That doesn't necessarily mean it's newer information, but it's likely, isn't it? There's also meta-data on the page suggesting it's up to date as of Feb 5th.

What I THINK this means is they didn't cover their shorts--rather, they had to short again to drive the price down, increasing their short interest. They successfully drove it down and probably convinced lots of people to sell. That number could be a few days old too, so my best guess is that either they have already been slowly covering shorts but not to a degree that it would drive the price up, or they're still driving the price to rock bottom so that it will encourage even more selling and will allow them to recover their position more easily. The latter is what I think is the case, based on everything I absorbed this week and was led to believe would happen. The stock would tank to almost nothing before the squeeze--everyone expected this, yet still panicked, then all the weird shit in this sub started happening. 

Also, all of this relies on retailers having more shares, which people have been questioning. I have no idea the truth there, except another redditor created python script to find unique instances of things like ""holding 150 @ 70"" and stuff like that, then did a conservative estimate to find that we hold at east 38 million of 70 million shares. 

Ultimately, I'm a moron and I'm in way over my head, but I feel like if people actually hold, they will eventually cover their shorts and we'll see an uptick that will be at least significant."|2021-02-05 16:14:35.527273|../output/raw/2021/02/05/DueDiligence_flair_DD_161437.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'FINRA', 'I', 'I', 'THINK', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']|[]

If you haven’t heard of Agora, they’re a company founded in 2014 by Tony Zhao (Founding engineer @WebEx) that provides live audio services, similar to how Twilio provides SMS, and they charge by the minute.  Basically you sign up with them then build your app/service and plug into their services.  It recently had a big spike in price due to Elon Musk who participated in a live chat on Clubhouse with a group of 5000 others.  It’s said Clubhouse was built in one week because they were able to use Agora.

Clubhouse isn’t the only customer, they have Yalla, a fast growing middle eastern app, large customers in education (China has 1500+ schools), TeleHealth, MeetMe, and a bunch of others. The use cases for live audio are many.  There’s a lot of video and text out there, but a lot of content sharers would prefer not being seen.

The stock has been on a tear the past couple of weeks, up more than 100% rise in shares as people realize the potential of the company.  Valued at about 8 billion (Twilio is valued around 58 billion).

They have a clear path to profitability as they rely on a usage model.  Let the customers innovate, and their success becomes their own.  The Agora website states they provide an average of 40 billion minutes a month.  That works out to be about 40 million in revenue if we assumed they were all paid minutes (standard pricing is 99 cents for every 1000 minutes), but they do offer promotions and bulk discounts so revs would be lower but important thing is it’s growing exponentially.

The stock isn’t cheap based on current sales to price ratio, 70 times, but customer growth from 2019-2020 was 100% YoY, and 2021 should see much higher numbers.  Also another risk is it is China based and we know things can be tricky there politically, although they have a US base as well in Santa Clara, so pretty sure they are already helping to secure US based data and something they are focused on.

Do your own DD, but I’m an uber bullish on this.  It is still relatively unknown company, but it’s being used as a proxy to invest in Clubhouse, and has some big names backing it"|2021-02-05 16:14:35.527273|../output/raw/2021/02/05/DueDiligence_flair_DD_161439.csv|DueDiligence|['DD', 'S']|[]|['DD', 'I', 'SMS', 'Y', 'US', 'US', 'DD']|[]

Just a pre-cursor, this is my first post of any kind on WSB. I would occasionally peruse the forum but was obviously drawn here from the GME craze and love every part of it.

**Score Media and Gaming, listed on the TSX as SCR and in the US as TSCRF.**

These guys have nothing but positive news coming in the next 12 months and has the ability to at least double in the next half year, if not sooner. These guys are foraying into the sports betting market and are the only players that have a fully intuitive and integrated sports scores/stats application on the market.

So what are the positives/catalysts for Score Media:

\- Expansion with the help/investment of Penn Gaming to expand sportsbook in the US. Keep in mind, Penn is the same company that invested in Barstool. The Score is already approved in New Jersey, Indiana and Colorado, with Iowa right around the corner, and Michigan up next.

\- Sports betting in Canada is a 14 Billion dollar market. Single wagering is currently illegal, however, there is unity across the aisle between all political parties to amend the criminal code and make single wagering legal. There are currently two bills in play. C-13 and C-218. C-13 second reading is currently delayed, while C-218 is scheduled for the House of Commons on February 24th. Like most countries, they have currently spent a ton of money propping up their respective economies due to COVID-19. It is highly unlikely the Canadian government rejects this massive taxable revenue stream when it needs it the most

\- Leader in sports applications for time spent on the app on a monthly basis, beating out heavy hitters like TSN, ESPN, Bleacher Report....literally every other sports media application

\- Only major player with an already existing sports news/fantasy application with seamless sportsbook integration. No hopping back and forth, you can wager through the sports app as if you were on the sportsbook

\- They are the biggest E-sports media player with over 1 million subscribers on YouTube and that lead is growing

\- They are pushing to get listed on the NYSE in the very near future to further growth and investment opportunities.

The only real hinderance that could potentially stop the run of this company is if the Canadian government fails to amend the current laws for single game wagering, which in the current economical climate, I find extremely unlikely. ESPECIALLY with support from all political parties including the Conservatives, New Democratic Party, Bloc Quebecois and most Liberal MP's.

Even in the event that this for some reason failed to pass, it still has access to an enormous US market with the backing of Penn.

I love this stock boys and girls!

We’re still doing that right? Here’s some theories on catalysts that will launch this $Rocket.

 

🚀 Earnings are scheduled for Feb 25 after close (estimated). Expiration of calls on 2/26 will be perfect to play a run-up or just to gamble on earnings itself and close the position on Friday after they report Thursday AH. Buying multiple options allows both! Even if there are just 2 options, 1 could be used for a run-up play, sell it to decrease overall cost basis, and then ride the other option through earnings for the gamble.
 

🚀 🚀Guess who is on a top list of short interest? You guessed it, $RKT. Per the list at https://www.highshortinterest.com/, $RKT is number 17 at 40.72% on 102.38M float. When filtering down to where our friends $GME and $AMC are listed on NYSE, $RKT takes the number 8 position. They are number 1 in short interest in the Consumer Lending industry. I don’t think I need to explain what short interest is and how it can impact a stock price. Mark Cuban loves when people short his stocks. Now do I think there will be a squeeze? No, I do not think there will be a squeeze but I could see some hedgies getting taken over by FUD and getting out of short positions which will cause a slight uptick. As such, it may be wise to buy options with a little more time on them, so that they could be held another week when they have surprise earnings moving the price up, hedgies cover, and drive the price up even more into the following week. Play would be to buy 3/5 expirations or even go out to 3/19 where there’s a lot more volume.  Personally, I like the play from number 1.
 

🚀 🚀 🚀 Home sales are the highest they have ever been EVER. Go play with the chart here: https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/existing-home-sales. The 1 year bar chart shows those 3 months are the three highest months in the past year. Guess what time period $RKT is reporting? Yep, quarter ending calendar December 2020. Obviously adding up by quarter results in this being the highest quarter ever. In the 5 year chart the trend looks like a $SPY chart. The last three months are significantly higher than any of the relatively consistent bars for the past 4.75 years. Perhaps that volume in the past three months is just making up for the dip during the start of the pandemic in the US and current low interest rates. Perhaps that true, but the market cares about quarterly results and I don’t think that surprise is priced in. 
 

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 Last earnings EPS consensus was 0.79 vs the actual reported of 0.96, which is a surprise of +21.5% (https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/rkt/earnings). The consensus for this upcoming earnings is 0.86, which is only a increase of ~9% from their previous (wrong) estimate. Based on the home sales Q-o-Q increase alone of 10.4%, there EPS should really be about 1.06, which will be a surprise of over +23%. I am not a financial advisor, nor a mathematician so do your own subtracting and dividing and don’t forget your parenthesis. Order of operations are important —> buy low, sell high.
 

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 So that’s all the number stuff, what about the soft data. Has anyone actually bought a house recently? I know some people that have moved states, moved cities, even moved streets, and there is a LOT of activity. I personally have received cold calls offering me positions to be a loan auditor and loan closer. The wait time on the transactions of people I know hasn’t been exorbitant but you can definitely tell the people on the other end of the line aren’t browsing this sub; they are legitimately busy. Who knows about employee effectiveness, but I think that companies are getting the most out of their employees during a sudden increase in demand before they can fill more positions. The existing people are working hard, not browsing reddit, and getting paid the same amount (or maybe slightly more if they get overtime). All the on-boarding and incremental labor costs haven’t hit yet, because they are still up-cycling to meet the new demand. More revenue + same labor cost with more effectiveness is more to the bottom line.

 
🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 But how do you feel about the stock? I think I like this stock. But just for a quick date, and then close out everything once they tell me their life story for the last three months.
 
 

TLDR; the name of the stock is literally $rocket. People are buying houses like crazy. Earnings on Feb 25.

 

Positions: $RKT 2/26 $22.00 and $23.00 calls. Also holding shares on all BANG GANG, among other various options and shares. 220 shares strong on $GME at average of $201.

Understand the market mechanics.

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice.

The following models use both realistic, simplified, and hypothetical numbers/premises. Map the logic and conclusions to reality at your own discretion.

## Model 1: One-to-One

Players:

* 1 HOLDER
* 1 SHORTER

Naked shorts are absolutely dangerous. Consider a struggling company ABC, with 1 outstanding share owned by a single HOLDER. Trustworthy fundamental-analysts say that its stock is worth 10 USD per share given the risk involved. Recent stock trades have been around 12 USD; this is the current market price.

A single SHORTER expects company ABC to go bankrupt. They write a call-option and list it on the options market at a price of 100 USD.

The call-option says: this call-option expires in 7 days. Before it expires, the owner of this call-option may exercise it to buy 1 share of company ABC from SHORTER at a per-share price of 200 USD. SHORTER has 72 hours to deliver the share, from time of exercise.

SHORTER knows that any buyer would have to pay 100 USD (for the call-option itself) plus 200 USD (to buy the called-share) for a total share cost of 300 USD. In order for any buyer to make money, they would have to sell their newly-bought share for above 300 USD, a ridiculous dream given the current market price and realistic business-trajectory potential of company ABC. Only a retard would buy, but if one comes along and does, SHORTER gets 100 USD. If the retard exercises the option, SHORTER gets another 200 USD and just loses around 12 USD for buying the share from the market and tossing it to the retard (who, at that point, apparently needs help from the options market to buy a single share of a junk company). Easiest fucking money of SHORTER's life.

HOLDER sees the true opportunity and pays 100 USD to SHORTER; in exchange, SHORTER gives the call-option to HOLDER. HOLDER checks SHORTER's net worth and estimates it at 200 BILLION USD. HOLDER places a 1-share limit-sell order to the stockmarket exchange at an asking price of 100 BILLION USD. When the limit-sell order is confirmed, HOLDER immediately exercises the option, paying SHORTER 200 USD.

SHORTER is now obligated to give 1 share to HOLDER. SHORTER happily sends a 1-share limit-buy order for 20 USD to the exchange and waits. Time passes. As the 72-hour clock ticks, SHORTER increases their limit-buy bidding price. No sellers at even 100 USD bid. What is happening? SHORTER checks the sell-wall and sees only 1 share offered at 100 BILLION USD. SHORTER is never buying a junk company share for 100 BILLION USD. Time runs out. The government/stockmarket-exchange forces SHORTER to liquidate their assets and fulfill their option-obligation to HOLDER. SHORTER unhappily buys 1 share of company ABC for 100 BILLION USD (from HOLDER, who receives the 100 BILLION USD and loses their share). SHORTER then gives the expensively-acquired 1 share to HOLDER to fulfill the call-option obligation.

HOLDER happily confirms their portfolio: ~100 BILLION USD and 1-share of company ABC. HOLDER likes the stock.

## Model 2: Many-to-Two, Special Effects

Players:

* 1 HOLDER1
* 1 HOLDER2
* 100 SHORTERS

Company ABC has 10M outstanding shares. HOLDER1 owns 9M shares. HOLDER2 owns 1M shares.

100 SHORTERS collectively list 10M call-options for a price of 100 USD each. Each call-option is for 1-share at an expiry duration of 30 days, strike price of 200 USD, and delivery leadtime of 3 days.

HOLDER2 buys all the call-options for a total of 1 BILLION USD. In order for HOLDER2 to get a net profit, HOLDER2 must sell each share at an average price of at least 301 USD (100 USD option-price plus 200 USD strike-price). Currently, there are no outstanding sell-orders or buy-orders on the stock exchange for company ABC. HOLDER2 exercises all their call-options, paying the SHORTERS a collective total of 2 BILLION USD.

Here we branch into multiple possibilities:

OUTCOME 1: 0:1M Squeeze

HOLDER2 places sell-limit orders for all 1M of their shares at 1000 USD each. HOLDER1 does not participate at all. SHORTERS are forced to buy 1M shares at 1000 USD each; HOLDER2 gets 1B USD and all 1M shares back. HOLDER2 places another 1M-share limit-sell order for 1000 USD each; the SHORTERS are forced to buy and give back again. HOLDER2 repeats this process for a total of 10 cycles until they end up with 10B USD and back to 1M shares of company ABC. HOLDER2's net profit is 7 BILLION USD.

SPECIAL: SHORTER BANKRUPTCY

Some SHORTERS cannot afford to fulfill their short obligation at 1000 USD per-share. They declare bankruptcy and some of their money pays for other things in order of liquidation-liability-priority. Some SHORTERS have moved their assets into separate shell companies to avoid the squeeze illegally. In this case, HOLDER2 may not even break-even with the options of these bankrupt SHORTERS.

SPECIAL: SHORTER VIOLENCE

Some SHORTERS are willing to cross any ethical line. They kidnap HOLDER2 and/or people they care about, and negotiate a ransom to release them only if HOLDER2 nullifies those SHORTERS' short obligations. In this case, HOLDER2 takes a full loss with the options of these violent SHORTERS.

SPECIAL: SHORTER COMPANY-COLLUSION

Some SHORTERS have tendrils of control deep into the company. These SHORTERS are somehow able to convince the board of directors to issue new shares and sell them to the SHORTERS at rock-bottom prices directly, legally or illegally. In this case, HOLDER2 takes a near-complete dollar-loss with the options of these company-colluding SHORTERS.

OUTCOME 2: 9M:1M Squeeze, Out-of-the-Money Competition

HOLDER2 places sell-limit orders for all 1M of their shares at 1000 USD each. HOLDER1 places sell-limit orders for all 9M of their shares at 200 USD each (notably, below the price at which HOLDER2 can make a net profit; above the price at which SHORTERS keep some profit). SHORTERS rush to buy all 9M of HOLDER1's shares for 1.8B USD total. SHORTERS then rush to buy all 1M of HOLDER2's shares for 1B total. SHORTERS give all 10M shares to HOLDER2. HOLDER2's final position is 10M shares owned with net 2B loss. If HOLDER2 kept some of their original shares off the market, ex. 500K, HOLDER2 would be able to solo-squeeze the straggling SHORTERS to potentially still make a net-profit (limited by the net worth of the remaining SHORTERS on the hook).

OUTCOME 3: 5M-5M Squeeze, In-the-Money Collaboration

HOLDER2 places sell-limit orders for all 1M of their shares at 1000 USD each. HOLDER1 places sell-limit orders for 1M of their shares at 1000 USD each. SHORTERS are forced to buy all 2M shares at 1000 USD each then fulfill all of them to HOLDER2. HOLDER2 gets 1B USD and 2M shares. HOLDER1 gets 1B USD and loses 1M shares.

HOLDER2 sells 2M shares at 1000 USD each. HOLDER1 sells 2M shares at 1000 USD each. SHORTERS are forced to buy/fulfill all 4M shares. HOLDER2 gets 2B USD and 4M shares. HOLDER1 gets 2B USD and loses 2M shares. Repeat this 2M:2M sell-cycle once, for all 10M shorts to be fulfilled.

HOLDER2 ends with 6M shares and net profit of 2 BILLION USD.

HOLDER1 ends with 5M shares sold for total of 5 BILLION USD, with 4M shares remaining.

## Model 3: Many-to-Many, Special Effects, GME Edition

Players:

I want to try and bring this sub back to where is was before, so heres some simple DD. I'd recommend following it if ur bag holding AMC or GME. Ur gonna need it the money.

For those who don't know, Intel($INTC) has announced Pat Gelsinger to be the new CEO. This is a big deal for Intel because he has a tech background(engineer) and so he has a deeper understands what needs to be done in order for Intel to get back on track. This is miles different than the previous CEO(Bob Swan) who was from a finance background. Pat had previously worked at intel for 30 years before moving on to other things. During this time, he was the leader of many companies and led them(such as VMware) to success. So this new CEO brings the engineering brain, as well as the business skills that are necessary.

Not only is he bringing his knowledge about tech, he was able to get former Intel vice president Sunil Shenoy to come back as head of Intel's design engineering group. And Shenoy isn't the only person he was able to bring back. Since the new CEO announcement, Intel has rehired researcher Glenn Hinton. And it is hinted that other leaders may be coming back also.

This is big news. Intel is showing us that once again they are going to put all their manpower in order to create superior products and are brining in people who can actually do the job. It's great that the new CEO is bringing in old faces that he is most likely familiar with. This will help him lead the company in the direction he wants without much push back.

After the big announcement, Intel stock rose as much as 18% in the days following, only to have dropped back down after Gelsinger announced that he intended to retain Intels factory network. However, I believe that with this new leadership, Intel has a chance at fighting back AMD's amazing innovations with innovations of their own.

For those here who might doubt intel because of their recent bad track record, and the big strides that AMD has been making, I'd like to put things into perspective.

AMD's **TOTAL** revenue in 2020 was 9.76B

Intel's **THIRD QUARTER** revenue in 2020 was 18.3B

Intel is just a different beast than AMD. AMD might have better chips at the moment, but with the new leaders who are well versed in the engineering behind the technology, I believe Intel can quickly catch up, and other investors see this as well.

If all this is not enough for you, then how about some good old charts

Intel is currently showing an Ascending triangle. For those who don't know, this is a pretty decent bullish pattern

Gelsinger is set to officially become the CEO on February 15. Don't miss out.

Tl;Dr: buy Poshmark. It's been corrected a lot since the IPO high of 105 


Alright everyone... While I wouldn’t define myself as a necessarily intelligent (or competent) investor, but I am very familiar with the platform and the re-commerce industry as a seller and buyer.

I’ve been selling people’s used shit since high school, in an attempt to finance a previous weed addiction. Fast forward 4 years and I have still been selling people’s used shit, though now the funds are going toward monthly Model 3 payments I am underwater for. That said, I’ve been selling used clothing and have completed a bit over $300k in gross sales through various “re-commerce” platforms such as eBay, Amazon, FB Marketplace, Mercari, Grailed, and Poshmark. eBay is the most well established platform for used clothing sales and thus wins for market share, but Poshmark wins in nearly every other category- which I have broken down below.




**Selling fees:**

Poshmark has ridiculous selling fees, although it has proven to be beneficial in respect to revenue. The platform makes money by charging a fee for every sale: 20 per cent for items more than $15, and a flat fee of $2.95 for items under $15 that are less than that. Products worth more than $500 must be sent to Poshmark for evaluation, but the average order value is $33. 20% is ridiculous, especially considering that this does not include shipping costs of the seller/buyer. All the other platforms take a standard deviation around 10%, which begs the question why the fuck do they charge so much. People complain but continue to use the platform because of the next point- shipping.

**Shipping:**

For the past few years, the platform and its social media/YouTube influences have been aggressively marketing towards stay at home mothers and teenage girls. These aren’t your typical streetwear wannabe EnTrePenUeR businessmen, and Poshmark certainly knows that. They supply USPS Priority Mail shipping labels for every. single. fucking. order. Have a 2oz necktie that would ship for $2.62 USPS first class? Fuck that. Poshmark send you a $7.11 Priority Mail label that will arrive to your buyers doorstep faster than Amazons COVID shit prime delayed delivery. While a cost deterrent for lower value items and cheap buyers, this system simplifies the selling process of needing to calculate shipping costs and having to deal with various mail carriers. Packages rarely gets lost and any lost package issues are generally covered by Poshmark or the insure USPS provides through Priority Mail.




$7.11 is cheaper than my Ebay rate for any priority mail, so I also give this one to Poshmark as they seem to have worked something out with USPS. For eBay, if I can shove a pair of Jeans into a Flat Rate Envelope it will cost me $7.59 to ship. Any heavier or larger clothing items cost me, on average, about $9-14. While this last part is speculation, I do believe that Poshmark does get a kickback or receive some commission from every label. The cost has risen about $2 in the past couple years, which is a higher percentile than the USPS shipping rate increase.

**Convenience:**

Buyers love convenience, and poshmark certainly does well in that regard. Poshmark is a large SoCiAl MeDiA MarKetPace, giving them access to a fuckload of your data. When you sign up, you can add the city you live in, university, job etc. You also have the ability to like and share items.

Both of these combined, allow the app to recognize who you are what what type of items you may be interested in buying. My homepage looks the same as my closet at home, shoving new items, markdowns, etc from brands I am much too familiar with.

A lot of purchases tend to be of impulse on the buyer, which is good for sellers since Poshmark doesn’t allow returns (unless fake/ruined/ not as described). I have a handful of buyers asking me to return items every week because they don’t like the color, fit, or price; I tell them to fuck off and Poshmark gets to keep the commission. For reference, my return rate on eBay is about 7% for no reason.

I just sold this Ikea Rug today that I was too lazy to return. I paid $10 for it and the buyer most likely saw the nice stock photos on their homepage and failed to crosscheck the price on IKEA. Convenience of the homepage.




**SEO:**

I study rhetoric so I have no fucking clue how to rank or asses the SEO of a company, but look for any used clothing brand and Poshmark will generally be the first to show up on google. If that doesn’t signify good SEO, idk remember I study rhetoric.




**Market share:**

In terms of Fashion and clothing APPS, I think Poshmark does fairly well. An in depth DD would reference technology, social media, and e-commerce platforms as well- but I’ll just include a graph I found.

In terms of their presence online, I think Poshmark does the best job engaging with their users. They are constantly reposting buyers and sellers images on instagram- making it somewhat of an incentive to use the platform and engage with others in the community. I’ve been posted a few times on their instagram page and story. As a seller, I’ve also been invited out to drinks with some of the staff in SF. Was all food and drinks at the bar covered by Poshmark? Idk ask my Jonny Walker Blue.


**TLDR:** I think Poshmark is a great platform, doing very different things than traditional selling platforms. Much higher fees and seamless shipping integration makes the platform a winner. They are valued as a selling platform, but they are much more than simply just that. Can you buy Lululemon pants at $GME? No, but you can on Poshmark. I also have not proofread this post at all.

No date is announced but it’s expected to happen in the first quarter of 2021. 

For those unfamiliar with SoFi, it’s essentially a very user friendly online lender. At least that’s what it started as... they now also offer commission free brokerage services, and are applying for a bank charter as well which would be a huge catalyst for growth. I believe this company will be a disruptor in the tech finance space. Here’s an article with some more info [Article](https://marketrealist.com/p/buy-ipoe-spac-stock/).

Fellow apes,
I believe we are in a very interesting position right now, and we still face the very real possibility of seeing a massive short squeeze on GME. Full disclosure: 11 shares @ $180 average, I am poor college ape. This is also not financial advice, I am dumb ape.
This is going to be a long post. I know you apes hate reading, but I think this post is going to contain some very helpful and reassuring information for many of us, and I encourage all ape to try their best to read. TLDR at bottom for silly monke.
Let's take a moment to consider where we are with respect to GME, and rethink all the events that have just unfolded over the last few weeks. Starting early January, we saw the price of GME hovering just below the $20 mark. GME had been floating around the $10 - $20 range since about mid October. As GME started to increase in popularity on WSB, due to rumors around Ryan Cohen's interest in the company, the price continued to increase. During this time, short sellers began rapidly opening positions because they believed GameStop was headed to bankruptcy due to the shift away from physical retail stores, and because they were betting the hype around GME would eventually die off and the share price would fall. On January 11th, Ryan Cohen gained a seat on the board, held a 13% stake in the company, and the share price jumped almost 20% to $20.65. This is an important date and an important price in our story. The January 15th official short interest report stated 61,780,000 shares had been sold short. On the 15th, the share price was about $35. This is a crucial piece of information to consider. Short Interest is reported twice monthly, so the last report before January 15th was from December 31st, and the next report won't be issued until February 9th. The next report will show short interest up to January 29th. Keep that in mind, I'll come back to this point later.
Back to the January 15th report. 61.78 million shares had been shorted at prices less than $35. Every single short of those 61.78 million was betting the price would be less than $35, and it's more likely that most were shorted around the $15 - $20 mark. I don't have exact numbers, but for the sake of simplicity and also conservatism, I am going to assume these 61.78 million shorts were for $30. These shorts would only make profit if the price was to go below $30. For ape who STILL doesn't understand what shorting a stock is, please read this. On January 15th, at least 130% of the float had been sold short. Yes this is possible, and does not necessarily indicate wrong doing by hedge funds or market makers. The January 15th report serves as one of the main catalysts for the giant price leap from $35 to $483. The report was released on January 27th, and the share price hit $375 the same day, followed by a peak at $483 on the 28th. Since then, the price has decreased all the way back down to $65 at the time of writing.
This is where we get into the main point of my thesis, and why I believe we should not be worried about this massive drop in price. My argument: MOST short positions from the January 15th report have NOT covered yet. Why would they have? What we saw from January 11th to 28th was a run up fueled entirely by hype and a couple of gamma squeezes. The short squeeze did NOT happen. But it will. Hedges are still better off paying their interest payments on their short positions than covering millions of shares for prices over $300.
The hedge funds and other players were able to drive the price down from $483 to $65 in less than a week. Regardless of the illegal actions they took to make this happen, it is still the reality we face. Their biggest win was hitting a big stop-loss raid when the price went down to $250. The price was forced down not just because of ""short laddering"", but because they were able to hit psychological prices were many holders had set stop losses. $250 stop losses dropped down to $225, which dropped down to $200, etc. Shares were sold at these prices, not to the shorts looking to cover, but to other retail investors and some institutions hoping for the eventual short squeeze.
The hedge funds knew they would be able to do this. It didn't even take that long. In 6 days they had brought the price down over $400. So why in the world would they have covered even a single share above $100?? Answer: they didn't. They are waiting to bring the price down to an acceptable level, buying far OTM calls, and letting"|2021-02-05 16:14:35.527273|../output/raw/2021/02/05/DueDiligence_flair_DD_161437.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['I', 'DD', 'ARE', 'AYING', 'CHESS', 'NOT', 'CKERS', 'B', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'TLDR', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'WSB', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'STILL', 'I', 'MOST', 'NOT', 'NOT', 'OTM']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Boeing has had a rough couple of years. In 2019 the 737 MAX was grounded and in 2020 the pandemic saw a massive slowdown in revenue for Boeing. The stock went from $446 to about $350 when the 737 was grounded, to a low of $89 in March because of the pandemic, and is now trading at around $210.

As the vaccine rolls out, and the 737 being approved for service, I think Boeing is one of the last great covid recovery plays and I think we will definitely see a reversal of their fortune in the long term, with great short term potential as well.

Operating as a duopoly with Airbus, Boeing has an exemplary economic moat and has years of backlog that will provide some good revenue. They have a history of providing military aircraft to the US and abroad. They are not going anywhere, regardless of the potential dropoff in civilian air traffic.

They've found strong support at this current level, and I think this is the start of the climb back to their pre covid/pre 737 price. Wouldn't be surprised if it is flirting with $500-600 in the next couple of years.

So decided to showcase a few things and kinda breakdown some strategy and why I am going very bullish on the U.S. market.

Everybody is under the crunch currently due to COVID. Companies are releasing abysmal earnings reports and that has caused losses all around. So the market this pass week has been a bit of a roller coaster because of the above issue.  Then this morning the Market shot up during opening hours. Why is that? Well the answer lies here in this news story. https://www.npr.org/2021/02/05/964365980/senate-passes-budget-resolution-vice-president-harris-breaks-tie

Now I don't care about the political implications of this. I only care about the Market effect. For those of you who don't know, Dems have rolled their stimulas plan that would give another 1400 bucks to Americans into what is known as a Reconciliation bill. Reconciliation bills are 1. Filibuster-proof and 2. Just require a majority vote. It's next stop is the house but just the IDEA that it's just one step away has launched some gains in this mornings trading session. 

The truth of the matter is, you buy for the future-regardless of what you are buying.

Keeping in mind that you buy for the future (doesn't matter if you take a bullish or bearish position). You need to see what is going on and what is being discussed.

I will lay out my strategy concerning XOM.

The Reconciliation bill was being talked about for the past week (Again, don't care about the political implications. If you do, suck a dick. Here to make money). Dems have recently taken control of the Senate since passing the power-sharing agreement. Biden is still in his first 100 days and they are going to want to put a jewel in his crown. Dems called for a late night session to vote on 11 amendments for the Reconciliation bill and it passed. During the same time, OPEC (a bunch of oil countries who pretty much control the market) had their ministerial meeting and kept their targets for Oil production (they cut heavily) and have also announced that oil levels are now at a draw (more oil going out than coming in https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/opec-signals-it-s-on-track-with-goal-to-drain-oil-inventories). We also got hit with jobless claims numbers and they were below expectations.

If I was a betting man (I am) I would put a bullish bet that Oil will be going up. Why? Due to the huge push of the Reconciliation bill, Oil now being at a draw, and less people that are unemployed. We can assume that there will be a huge demand for Gasoline with a potential that gas companies will be able to set the price that they want pretty much. 

Now for the retail sector. More money in people's pockets means more shit they are going to buy.  Just remove the bit about OPEC.

I put a bullish bet on XOM going up with 35c call @ 48 3/5.

ALLEGATION: SECURITIES FRAUD, NAKED SHORTING COLLUSION BETWEEN MELVIN AND CITADEL

Let's roleplay, retards. I'll play the billionaire fuckhead who wants to bankrupt Gamestop, because I think it'll be a fun story to jerk off to.

I hatch a brilliant little plan to short them to death. Here's my plan.

I collude with the company who invested in me, who processes my transactions, to make the world think I have 5 Million GME. This happens. I don't know how, but keep going with me.

So now, all I have to do, is NEVER let one of these specific 5 million GME shares out of my account, or the jig is up. They'd be caught as a FAIL TO DELIVER if someone ever got their hands on one. So how do I never sell one of these? Shorting!

But no no guys... not just regular shorting. We... we would short. EVERY. TRANSACTION. EVEN THE ONES THAT LOSE US MONEY. It's more important and valuable to me to pay for a clean share off the market to boomerang back, than it is to release one of my POISON SHARES into the market and get found out. Luckily, I know a clearinghouse that sits in front of all my transactions, and can help with this little bit of intercepting magic.

So, we do this for a while. Hey, wait, a big order came in, there wasn't enough float in the pool to boomerang clean shares, oh shit, we let a couple go. Well, let's wait and see what happens.

< INSERT LINK HERE TO THE FAIL-TO-DELIVERS ON GME SECURITY OVER TIME > [https://i.redd.it/1wpfodbyb6f61.png](https://i.redd.it/1wpfodbyb6f61.png)

Oh, shit. Things are warming up. People think Gamestop might really come back. If there's a lot of trading, they might've found out about my 5 million FAKE POISON shares, when the clearinghouse comes to deduct it from my account.

Oh, shit. It happened. A lot. Look at those fail to delivers. They're everywhere on $GME, and only on GME.

The jig is up.

I don't want to get caught, so I hit my ""omfg algorithm"" button, that will liquidate and put any asset in my entire portfolio in front of those buy orders for GME. I know, the redditors are idiots, so I'll HEDGE THIS POSITION with another profitable meme position.... like AMC.

They decided ""FUCK IT"" eventually, and traded in their **FAKE SHARES** for **REAL MONEY** at some point during this, and those are **FOUND OUT WITH FAIL TO DELIVERS**. THEY ARE SLIDING ALL THEIR ILL GOTTEN GME GAINS INTO OTHER STOCKS, PROBABLY THRU OTHER BROKERS, **SO THEY CAN BERNIE MADOFF THIS BITCH AND RUN AWAY WITH ALL THE MONEY.**

THOSE ARE FAKE SHARES, ""CREATED"" BY CITADEL AS IF MELVIN OWNED THEM, AND ALWAYS FRONTED (SEE: LAUNDERED) CLEAN SHARES WHENEVER TRANSACTIONS WOULD HAVE COME IN FOR THEM. AND THERES WAY MORE THAN 5 MILLION **AND** **~~ITS NOT JUST~~** **MIGHT NOT JUST BE GAMESTOP. \[Edited, im retarded\]**

please help me, I'm resorting to just sending people reddit DMs, I am 110% certain of this, you can call me the time traveler

Their stoploss algorithm is modeled after HYDRAULICS across their whole portfolio. The squeeze has a pressure relief valve, and this is it.

Imagine using your car jack while the handle is twisted open. No pressure, fluid is just movin around. Even in this state, sometimes if you pump it fast enough you can see little jumps of life. The real solution though, is to Tighten it up, now we have a pressurized system.

Visualize their algorithm as a cascading waterfall, pouring portfolio-wide capital to the very bottom until there is literally nothing left and in which case it EXPLODES. We hit that thursday with those reports of 5k bids being filled right before everything shut down. But in this waterfall, the only stock they HAVE to defend is GME. They already are out of water, but theyve erected an insanely big waterfall that hides where they are out of water up top, and fills it in by the time its time to fulfill at the bottom buy. The hole has ALWAYS been there the moment they overshorted, and it remains. Its why they didnt bail at 20, or 80, or 115. THEY CAN'T AS LONG AS THOSE NAKED SHORT VOLUME > FLOAT. This was the math all along.

This also explains the Fail to delivers on GME, the clearinghouses are finding the fake shares in the drains while Melvin tries to chlorine this pool.

**TLDR:** The mathematical strategy of the situation is to **reduce the blue area's leverage (multiplicative)**, and **grow the maximum red force (additive).**

We have to reduce blue to win, or come up with an incredible amount of red, quickly. If we don't, all of yellows dollars will flow to the other meme stocks / negatively correlated stocks and THERE WILL BE LESS TENDIES == LESS TOP END OF SQUEEZE. IN FACT, GME TENDIES ARE BASICALLY BEING GIVEN TO THE OTHER STOCKS, IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE COSTS LOW, SO THE COST OF COVERING THOSE FAIL TO DELIVERS IS MANAGEABLE.

Melvin (or to be fair, whoever originally authored and held the naked short shares) is using TIME as their ally - **THE FAIL TO DELIVERS == THE AMOUNT OF NAKED SHORT STOCK**, and IF THEY RUN OUT THE CLOCK, ALL OF THEIR FAKE STOCK GETS CAUGHT IN THE DRAINS AND IS PAID FOR BY WHOEVER PAYS FOR THAT SHIT **AND THEY DO NOT GO TO JAIL**

This theory connects the dots.

**Please if you have an in with wsb mods etc, forward them this to read. Ive been trying via modmail, posts, everything. Anyone with a platform needs to know this. Since all the memes are booming like an ETF, the profits on the others are being just siphoned into GME which holds their ultimate loss - the naked shorts that we KNOW they have on GME.**

EDIT2: omg melvin is so sinister. They knew redditors would bandwagon. They are using our own UNFOCUSED HYPE against us to prop up GME. PLEASE HELP ME BE A MEGAPHONE, WE HAVE TO GET THE WORD OUT.

They have been working hard on EV Semi Trucks and Autonomous Driving tech and for those that don't know, Paccar is the Fortune 500 parent company of brands like Kenworth and Peterbilt.

So one of the largest (if not largest) semi truck manufacturers in the world ...

It's up to 1% of the ARKK fund now and that's really all the DD I need. Cathie's been buying a stodgy old company that no one cares about? Oh wait, they are actually making autonomous EV semis and have the production capability to do so? Hmm.

How come no one has noticed this?

Guys hear me the fuck out. Aphria and Tilray are merging to form the *largest cannabis company in the fucking world.* Aphria ($APHA) is buying ($TLRY), but the new company will move under the $TLRY name. I know what you're thinking ""ok. 🦍's like TLRY. 🦍's buy TLRY."" No. 🦍's buy $APHA which is literally a discounted ticket the Tilray show. 

Prices **right now** $16.82 for $APHA and $27.10 for TLRY. after you've locked in a cost basis for **APHA** the price of the stock does not matter. The price of APHA could be $1/share or up to $20/share and it *wouldn't even fucking matter.* All that matters is your cost basis and TLRY price, and heres why. 

Regardless of where APHA is in April/May, your stock after the merger will be .8381 of whatever TLRY is trading at. So you give 2 shits about APHA price, and as long as TLRY stays above your cost basis plus 17% or if it rises to a point where the conversion makes the shares worth less (even if that happened, congrats because we went from ~$17 up to $20-$22 range depending), you're going to profit. Let's look at some numbers. 

10 shares APHA $168.20 

MERGER happens 

10 shares x .8381 (8.3) = $224.93 


This is called arbitrage and it's slipping away right in front of your face. Once APHA rises to TLRY and closes the gap, you lose the opportunity to lock in a low cost basis that will rise by 30+% on merger. 

$APHA 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 
$TLRY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Not financial advice, I eat crayons and stuff or whatever we're saying now. I basically just use this place as a good distraction not to stare at my portfolio second by second.

I am back today to share my DD on a company I have long loved but only recently started investing in

**RITE AID (RAD)**

Okay I know, robinhood is showing you it was .50 a year ago and you’re saying fuck idk about this one, it looks like I missed it.  It’s okay though, robinhood is just lying again.  The truth is that rite aid had a 1:20 **reverse stock split** artificially X 20 the price.

*WHAT DOES THIS MEAN*

It means we can assume two things, rite aid has only doubled in price since its mediocre deal with Walgreens fell through.  They have trimmed the fat and beat earnings the last three quarters.

Rite aid is starting vaccinations on February 12th, along with other pharmacies.  I believe they will be seeing a significant increase in revenue.

*PROMISING NUMBERS*

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/RAD/financials/annual/balance-sheet

For those that can’t read, this tells us that rite aid is seeing close to 10 billion in revenue a year and is only being valued at a little over ONE billion at the current stock price.  They’re looking at over 6 billion in property and two billion in inventory.  

**WHAT DO I DO**

I am very bullish on Rite Aid, but I would also consider this a long term play.  I own 1000 shares and a bunch of calls spread out.  I expect a bump next week as vaccine/corona cycles back into the news.  

I also believe Rite Aid is undervalued.  It *should* be trading at 50$ right now.  It has potential to be trading at ~100.

And >50% of the 54million shares are held by institutions, with 20% being used to short.

*What is averaging down?*

Example: You buy 10 shares at $350.  It tanks to double digits.  How do you fix this?

**By buying 10 shares at, for example, ~$50 or so.  This is averaging down.  Suddenly, your $350 average cost drops to $200.  With 20 more shares after that at $50 (40 shares total), average cost drops to $125.  (Price doesn't have to be exact but you get the idea).**

**So basically, you're lowering your break-even point by that much, while raising your profit potential with more shares!**

*What's the downside?*

**You're also adding money to this position, so only do this if you're absolutely sure it'll go back up to your break-even point at least.  Don't do this just to chase losses.**

*Why bother with this, considering you're risking even more money?*

Seeing a $350+ average cost while the underlying stays below $100 will most likely fuck with your mind (and that's not factoring in corporate-controlled news trying to manipulate you as well). The more emotional you get, the more likely you'll make mistakes.  It all depends on whether you're willing to throw in some more money to help stick to your convictions and clear your head.  And after spending $3500, what's $500 more to cut your break-even point almost in half?

*How can I avoid getting into this mess in the first place?*

Don't go all-in so soon.  Even only going in half makes a world of difference when you can spend the remaining half buying ~3x more shares at ~1/4 of the price (yes, at this point, you'd be all-in anyway, but at least you'd be doing so at a much lower price).  Just takes a bit of patience.  Either way, sooner or later, you mostly likely will have to hold, which is why mastering this is important.

You agreed to diamond hands. You agreed you would hold to the moon! 

Plenty of people have seen the ridiculous amount of manipulation and FUD going on. Ladder attacks keep driving the price down. How do we know it’s a ladder attack? Look at the volume of trades. Look at the amount of shares being traded one after another. 

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/real-time

100 shares. 100 shares. 100 shares. One after the other. 

Everyone was all in on the movement. Now you see these posts saying how they were lied to. How they are losing money. First off, you heard it before, YOU DON’T LOSE ANYTHING (or gain anything) UNTIL YOU SELL YOUR POSITIONS. Second, movements and change takes time. Think about how long it took for women’s rights. Gay marriage. You wife to have a bf, and that be ok. This is a revolution! Washington lost more battles than he won, but he won the most important!!!!

People in power don’t like losing. But we can do this. The day will come when the HF need to buy back shares. It costs nothing to hold. It costs money to sell. Will there be some crazy conspiracies? I’m sure there will be. 

If you don’t have any money in savings. You shouldn’t be buying. If you can’t stand volatility. You shouldn’t be buying. If you are easily manipulated. You shouldn’t be buying. 

Now, if you’re asking if it is a good time to buy, read the above. Dig deep and really be honest with yourself. BUT, if you already bought, just HODL!!! 

You are not alone. Deep down, many of us are nervous, but are riding it out anyway. Nobody likes to lose money, but IT TAKES MONEY TO MAKE MONEY!! 

I’ve dropped $15k so far. Plan on another $5k after this post. That’s not much for some, and more than ever seen for others. I’ve done my soul searching and have come to terms with the fact that if I lose it all, I am ok with that.
https://i.imgur.com/hG8TlFD.jpg

It’s not about how many shares you have. It’s not about making money. It is all about the point. It’s about beating the HFs at their own game. It’s about writing our names in the history books. I will die on this hill. When historians look back to find out why, they will see these Diamond Fucking Hands clenching my $GME shares. 


Be realistic though. GameStop should not be going bankrupt anytime soon. Look at the moves they are making!!! They just made some huge new hires to propel them forward! https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-creates-cto-position-hires-150104792.html

# Clover Health calls Hindenburg attack desperate attempt to position itself as a 'white knight'

[Clover Health Investments](https://www.cloverhealth.com/en/) ([CLOV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CLOV?p=CLOV&.tsrc=fin-srch)) on Friday [responded to ](https://medium.com/clover-off-the-charts/in-response-to-short-seller-firms-questions-47798b0b76da)an [attack from Hindenburg Research ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clover-shares-tumble-after-short-seller-hindenburg-attack-141549768.html)claiming the tech-focused healthcare company concealed key information from investors, including an active Justice Department investigation. In its response, Clover called Hindenburg’s claims a “desperate attempt for publicity” that disregards the truth.

Hindenburg, which is typically a short seller that bets companies’ stock will go down, said in its report on Thursday that it had no position in Clover, which sells Medicare insurance in mostly low-income areas. Rather, Hindenburg claimed it was issuing the report because it wants the public to know the role short sellers have in “[exposing fraud and corporate malfeasance](https://hindenburgresearch.com/clover/).”

But Clover suggested Hindenburg is merely trying to redeem its reputation in a climate where short sellers are viewed unfavorably. “Given the market’s latest views on short sellers, we believe that Hindenburg, which takes pains to call out their altruism in saying that they are not short on CLOV stock, is foolheartedly seeking to redeem itself by posturing as a white knight of the financial markets,” Clover[ said in its response](https://medium.com/clover-off-the-charts/in-response-to-short-seller-firms-questions-47798b0b76da), which said it had no knowledge of the Hindenburg report before it was made public on Thursday.

According to Hindenburg, a civil investigative demand letter from the Department of Justice shows it’s investigating 12 issues related to Clover, including its software “Clover Assistant,” as well as kickbacks, marketing practices, and undisclosed third-party deals. The investigation, Hindenburg concluded, presents a potential existential risk for a company that derives almost all of its revenue from Medicare.

The Hindenburg report also took aim at the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) led by Chamath Palihapitiya that took the tech-focused healthcare company public in January.

In its response, Clover acknowledged the Justice Department’s investigation, though said the company’s lawyers as well as outside and third-party lawyers, including IPO underwriter’s counsel, found it wasn’t material and therefore Clover determined it unnecessary to disclose to investors. The subject “received extensive focus and attention,” Clover said, during both its recent IPO and de-SPAC due diligence processes, and noted it had neither received civil investigative demands nor subpoenas.

Clover also responded to Hindenburg’s claims that its relationship with its subsidiary Seek Insurance was “thinly disclosed,” noting that it doesn’t mention the subsidiary on its website yet tells seniors that it will provide them with unbiased information on finding Medicare plans. In its response, Clover described Seek Medicare as a startup separate from Clover, with its own investor, board of directors, management team, and employees.

In response to Hindenburg’s critique over a reported $200 per patient visit fee that Clover pays to physicians who use its Clover Assistant software, Clover said, “To be clear, the ‘extra $200 per visit’ is not incremental or ‘just to use’ the Clover Assistant, but represents the overall payment that covers both the primary care physician (PCPs) office visit and the use of the Clover Assistant. This translates to roughly twice the traditional Medicare fees paid to PCPs for an office visit, more in line with fees paid to specialists.”

Clover said following Hindenburg’s publication on Thursday, it received an inquiry from the SEC, which the healthcare company said it believed was based on the Hindenburg report.

Hindenburg says its report is based on “more than a dozen interviews with former employees, competitors, and industry experts,” along with government reports and insurance filings.

The short seller is known for issuing a scathing report in September calling the electric truck startup Nikola ([NKLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NKLA/)) a fraud, causing that [company’s stock to plummet](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nikola-calls-shortseller-report-a-hit-job-shares-still-fall-185403477.html).

While Clover shares tumbled after Thursday’s report, they were up nearly 3% after the market open on Friday.

They thought WSB was made of 🧻👐, but we are made of carbon 💎👐.

They sold over 100% in short interest, having to also pay a premium. When it was time for the squeeze they put themselves in, they thought it would be best to short >100% so they can at least make some folks realize their gains so the hedges can have more money AND DECREASE THEIR OWN SHORT INTEREST POSITION.

This led to their attempt to psychologically chip away paper hands... Lo and behold, their attempts to drive the price from $500.00 pps, to the $50.00 would allow them to regain the shares they sold short or naked...

So if we hold AND CONTINUE TO HOLD, their psychological attempt to make us sell would actually dig them into a deeper hole.

Being able to have real-time data and alerts about glucose levels can be life saving, keep in mind Diabetes is the nation’s seventh-leading cause of death, accounting for more than 79,000 deaths annually. It also [contributes to deaths from heart disease and stroke](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/diabetes/why-diabetes-matters/cardiovascular-disease--diabetes) which are the leading and fifth-leading causes of death, respectively. There are three major [types of diabetes](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/quick-facts.html): type 1, type 2, and gestational. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90 to 95 percent of all cases. Eversense aims to keep that safely under control.

Lastly, I was looking on [https://fintel.io/so/us/sens](https://fintel.io/so/us/sens) the institutional ownership of this stock and well, I have to admit it is rare to encounter such big players involved in a pennystock. George Soros **Soros Fund Management** holds 10m shares, **PHC** holds a staggering 24% stake, **Roche Holding** is a multibillion dollar Swiss company in the pharmaceutical/diagnostics space.

But I’m buying the hell out of $BB rn. It is by far the lowest risk of the bunch with real fundamentals behind it. That’s why it’s been able to hold the line better than the rest.

This is a legit tech company with some solid patents and breakout potential with big partnerships on the horizon. 

What’s more, $BB has been shorted to hell like all of the rest. The same people who doubled down on their shorts on $AMC and $GME have been hammering down on $BB to spread the risk, except they seriously messed up here as this one actually has sharp teeth.

Short volumes have been lower than the others but still through the roof: http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html

There won’t be the same level squeeze we saw with $GME but there’s going to be a squeeze.  This is a SAFE $30 stock in the very near future.

Green energy is going to be a booming industry in the next few years as the climate situation comes more into the American social consciousness. Though I'm not expecting much from the Biden administration, they have rejoined the Paris Agreement. Additionally, loud progressives and Bernie Sanders as the head of the Senate Budget Committee points towards climate action being addressed soon. When this happens, it will probably take the form of requiring energy providers to overhaul their energy sources to renewable resources. This has been done recently at the state level, and the US government likes to work off of precedent.

**How does SunRun fit in?**

As a zoomer, there are sever things I feel like I understand about Americans and about the American economy. **Americans pay for convenience, and they'd rather not think about the hard stuff.** This can be shown from the continued embrace of Amazon, to every mom and pop shop that gets shut down when a walmart opens up in town. So what happens when an electricity company decides to tell it's customers that they should use solar panels to help save them money? What happens when those customers aren't just residential customers but businesses with bigass roofs as well? **They save money.**

[https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/solar-panel-cost](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/solar-panel-cost)

 And guess what people like to do? Exactly.  

Sunrun has become the second largest solar company in the US since opening in 2007, and sells itself as a company that takes care of all the hard shit for the customer. 

""Once a customer decides to proceed with the installation, Sunrun’s BrightPathTM software uses satellite images and its database of thousands of solar panel designs to find the best fit. Sunrun has developed a network of installation teams consisting of employees and licensed partners, who then visit the home to evaluate the design selection. Only after this step would Sunrun pick the appropriate solar panel, which would generally fit into four distinct types – monocrytalline, polysilicon, thin film silicon, and building integrated photovoltaic panels (BIPV). ""

Combine this with the fact that Sunrun operates in 20 states and has been seeing consistent growth for the past few years, as well as their acquisition of Vivint Solar in 2020 means they will do nothing but grow for the next few years.

**“Seems more likely that android auto or whatever apple comes up with takes over as they are more familiar to consumers and have already proven wildly successful”**

This is a comment I got on one of the Blackberry DD posts, It made me decide to read more and stop being emotional in how I support the company's progress. I decided to analyze all bear cases I receive Blackberry.

[https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/01/cars/ford-google-android-cloud-partnership/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/01/cars/ford-google-android-cloud-partnership/index.html)

""Millions of Ford vehicles will run Google's Android operating system starting in 2023""

This the Ford and Google press release title from CNN.

First of all, very bold for Ford to assume they are going to be selling millions of cars in 2023. Their top seller is the F150 is going to banned from sales in most of the developed world during this decade. This is a different argument for later, my argument here is how the press release was made.

This press release is kind of desperate. If your sales estimate is the first part of your statement and not the new technology you are announcing, then this is a stock pumping press release.

On the contrary, Here is the Blackberry announcement 3 months ago announcing that they signed a deal with Ford that paved the way to integrate Android into the system.

[http://www.qnx.com/news/pr\_6294\_1.html](http://www.qnx.com/news/pr_6294_1.html)

It’s a very technical press release. It’s very professional, what you expect to see from an engineering company announcing a deal. They didn’t say “Billions to be generated from a new deal with Ford”.

**With no pumping, What is the Ford and Android deal exactly?**

That means future Fords will feature Sync systems that use Google Maps and Android's excellent voice recognition, as well as opening up the platform to third-party developers. Ford will also use Google Cloud for its connected services, and the two companies will collaborate ""to create new experiences for customers.""

This is basically replacing the Sync 3 plus app. Android has an app already to sync your phone with the car. It’s like Chromecast for the car. The new announcement is basically saying that the sync3 app is going to be built-in inside the car. You can use it to open maps and have your other apps on and use an android voice assistant. Which exactly what

The car is still going to use QNX. Android can’t control car electronics. It’s a very sophisticated real-time processing of sensor data.

QNX controls the electronics of the F35 fighter jets. QNX was on the livery of Petronas Mercedes F1 car. Can you imagine how sophisticated it is to control the electronics of the fastest piece of machinery on earth? You can literally change the engine map while driving on 350 km/hour.

The good thing is that Blackberry responded. The company is paying attention to the people and keeps on assuring them. Blackberry posts regularly now on Twitter. They respond in a subtle way to the arguments. They probably upgraded their contract with the agency handling their social media affairs. They probably scan Reddit for them and the Blackberry PR team is aware of the conversations around the company."|2021-02-05 16:14:35.527273|../output/raw/2021/02/05/DueDiligence_flair_DD_161439.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['I', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'CNN', 'QNX', 'QNX', 'QNX', 'PR']|[]

WHO IS CARMAT ?

CARMAT was founded by Alain Carpentier in 2008, he is known to have performed the first artificial heart implant in Europe in 1986. He is also the father of the mitral valve repair techniques.

The biggest player behind this company is Airbus which co-founded it.

# 2. WHO IS AESON ?

Aeson was a king of Iolcus in ancient Greece but more importantly he reincarnated into the most advanced artificial heart currently on the market (UE). It’s currently the only product of CARMAT.

# 3. WHO IS ALCAR ?

ALCAR is the ticker name on Euronext. (For retards who can’t buy EU stocks go to chapter 10 )

# 4. CAN I HAVE MORE INFORMATIONS ON THIS AESON ?

You need first to understand there is multiple categories for medical cardiac devices :

1. **LVAD** Left Ventricular Assist Device
2. **RVAD** Right Ventricular Assist Device
3. **BiVAD** Biventricular Assist Device
4. **TAH** Total Artificial Heart

As a retard you would think that TAH is amazing and so Aeson should be category 4. This not the case. Aeson is so fucking amazingly advanced that they had to create a new category :

* **PHRT** Physiologic Heart Replacement Therapy

This is the only device in this category and due to the difficulty of the task, there is no other devices which is going to be able to compete with Aeson in the near future  (>10 years)

So why is this AESON so fucking amazingly advanced ?

1. **Pulsatility :** The artificial heart mimics a real heart with 2 pumps, 2 ventricles, 4 valves.
2. **Autoregulation :** The embedded sensors and microprocessors allow a live response to changing patient physiological needs. (It automatically adjusts if the patient walks, runs, sleeps, etc.. ; like a real heart)
3. **Hemocompatibility :** All the surfaces in contact with blood are totally hemocompatible.

Compared to other similar cardiac medical devices,Aeson is really safe. It is the only one which didn’t provoke any stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding or infection at the cable site (This artificial heart still uses an external battery) in any of the study participants.

# 5. SO CAN AESON BE USED COMMERCIALLY IN EU AND US RIGHT NOW ?

Not so fast, not so fast...

If it was 100% the case, the rocket would already have launched a long time ago !

There is 4 uses category for this device type :

1. **BTR**  Bridge To Recovery
2. **BTT**  Bridge To Transplantation
3. **BTB**  Bridge To Bridge
4. **DT**  Destination Therapy

The final target is DT ( Destination Therapy ), which means that the heart is going to be used as a permanent implant. In December 2020, Carmat received CE marking for BTT.

It means that it can be used, for now, as a temporary solution for patients which can receive real ❤️ transplantation but are still on the waiting list. Carmat, genius as they are, will also use the data from BTT patients to push for the DT.

The first commercial implants are going to be in Germany in Q2 2021 as they are ready to reimburse it.

In parallel, another study (EFICAS) is starting in France in Q2 2021 to drive Aeson adoption, support the value proposition and mainly to get French reimbursement.

In the US, They are starting the EFS (Early Feasibility Study) in Q1 2021 (now). 3 centers in the US are already trained and ready to implant their first patients.

# 6. OK COOL ! BUT WHAT IS THE MARKET SIZE ?

Currently the EU market for BTT is estimated to be of a minimum size of 2000 patients / year.

Right now Germany is the focus as it represents 40% of the EU market (800). France is following with 14% of the market (280). The competitors did less than 60 interventions in Germany and France last year on this type of patient (BVAD / Syncardia). Which is showing that the market is currently without any real competition as the concurrent products aren’t really as convincing which can explain their small volumes.

The combined EU-US market for DT is estimated to be around 180’000 / year.

On these 180’000 patients, around 3.3% are getting a real heart transplantation each year which is around 5’500. Which gives a market size of 174’500.

The market size is also growing each year for multiple reason :

* Ageing of population (boomers dying)
* The fatness of fat people is becoming more prevalent. (not fat shaming intended)
* The number of real ❤️ transplants could soon slow down as there will be less car accidents with new autopilots system (thanks daddy elon). An estimated 33% of all organ transplants come from deadly traffic collisions.

# 7. BUT CAN CARMAT PRODUCE ALL THESE HEARTS ?

Carmat finished building its first factory in France last year. It will be soon able to produce  **800 ❤️/ year**. As we see the current EU BTT market is large enough for this first factory.

The timing is really good as they will be able to optimize and streamline the industrialization and production process before the CE destination therapy marking and the BBT / DT FDA approval.

With the EU BTT market and current production capabilities, Carmat can partially finance the future studies, it’s development needs and new factories. This can prevent too much share dilution.

It is possible that for future factories in the US, Carmat could partner up with a big name (Edwards, Medtronic, Abbott, Johnson & Johnson, Boston Scientifics, etc... ). A partnering would give Carmat more credibility and a bigger commercial strike force in Uncle Sam Country.

# 8. LET’S SPEAK $$ /  REVENUES  / VALUATION  (QUALITY MATH ECONOMICS TIME )

**SOURCES OF REVENUES**

The 2 main sources of revenues for CARMAT are going to be :

* **Sales of Aeson :** We are going to do a conservative estimate of the price of AESON at $150’000 which is more or less the current price of the less advanced Syncardia TAH (the LVAD is $100’000 but not really comparable)
* **Aeson maintenance :** They can be conservatively estimated to be around $10’000/year

**REVENUES ESTIMATES**

* **Short term revenues estimates**, I am going to use the future production capabilities of the current factory -> 800 ❤️ per year. I won’t be using the maintenance revenues as in the short term only BTT category is used.
* **Medium term revenues estimates,** I’m going to use a pessimistic 5% market share.
* **Long term revenues estimates 1**, I’m going to go with the number of 25’000 heart which was a minimal target by the Prof. Christian Latrémouille, currently Director of Surgical Affairs at Carmat. This is still only 14% of market share on a market without real competition, it can still be seen as conservative
* **Long term revenues estimates 2,** I’m going to go with an arbitrary but realistic  30% market share.

For mid and long term, I’m going to use a conservative 5 years average survival rate for maintenance revenues (It should be a much longer)

&#x200B;

|*TIME REFERENCE*|*MATH*|*REVENUES*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|SHORT TERM (BTT ONLY):|800❤️ x $150’000|$120M|
|MID TERM|(0.05\*174’500)❤️ *( $150’000 + (5*$10’000))|$1B|
|LONG TERM 1|25’000❤️ *( $150’000 + (5*$10’000))|$5B|
|LONG TERM 2|(0.3\*174’500)❤️ *( $150’000 + (5*$10’000)|$10.5B|

**CARMAT VALUATION (P/S RATIO ADVANCED ANALYSIS)**

We are going to do a quick autistic but realistic valuation of CARMAT by comparing its revenues to 2 random companies in more or less the same sector (P/S ratio).

* SARTORIUS P/S = 13  (4 FEB 2021)
* ABIOMED P/S = 18  (4 FEB 2021)

From This let’s take a pessimistic starting P/S of 12 for our beloved CARMAT

My advance prediction model also predict a lowering P/S when the company gets bigger. (Because most of the times the growth is slowing(which wouldn’t necessary be the case for carmat… but whatever)) -> I thereby announce a pessimistic -2 P/S for each row in the following table (for big brain people : P/S = ((7-n)\*2)

|*TIME REFERENCE*|*MATH*|*VALUATION*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|SHORT TERM|$120M \* 12(P/S)|$1.44B|
|MID TERM|$1B \* 10(P/S)|$10B|
|LONG TERM 1|$5B \* 8(P/S)|$40B|
|LONG TERM 2|$10.5B \* 6(P/S)|$63B|

**SO HOW MUCH MY SHARES WILL BE WORTH ?**

**Currently there is 12.7M shares each worth $36 (4 FEB 2021)** for a total ridicul valuation of 457M (20 times less than fraud NKLA)

In mid / late 2021 there will probably be a share dilution to finance the future growth. But don’t worry, it will only help it to produce more ❤️. Let’s say they add a big amount of 2M shares between each row because why not and we are trying to do pessimistic revenues.

&#x200B;

|*TIME REFERENCE*|*MATH*|*SHARE PRICE*|*RETURN*|*ROCKET RATING*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|SHORT TERM|$1.44B / 14.7M|$98|**172%**|🚀|
|MID TERM|$10B / 16.7M|$598|**1561%**|🚀🚀|
|LONG TERM 1|$40B / 18.7M|$2139|**5842%**|🚀🚀🚀|
|LONG TERM 2|$63B / 20.7M|$3043|**8350%**|🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀|

&#x200B;

# 9. OK I SMELL TENDIES ! BUT WHAT ELSE ?

* The US EFS won’t cost a dime as carmat will get paid for each used ❤️.
* There are a lot of catalysts on the calendar this year. (first us implantation, first german commercial implantation, etc...)
* The margin on medical devices is huge (Stefan Piat (CARMAT CEO) is targeting 70% 🚀 )
* The market size I used only takes into account the current AESON which by its size can’t fit into your wife's chest neither in her asian boyfriend chest. Carmat is already working on a smaller ❤️ which would more than double the market size (Women + Asia) 🚀🚀
* I spoke about the market growth but didn’t took it into account in my advanced model 🚀🚀
* Stephan Piat had a high level job in Johnson & Johnson and Abbott, good relations can help sweet deals to be made. 🚀

# 10. BUT THE STOCK IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN EUROPOOR...

Stocks in europoor are worldwide famous for having a low valuation. Which is in fact a good occasion to get it before it comes to the US where valuation is without any known limits (🚀) !

# 11. BUT I NEVER INVEST IN BIOTECH COMPANIES WHICH STILL NEED AUTHORIZATIONS FOR THEIR PRODUCT !

It’s true that investing in small biotech companies is not for small balls investors. But if you followed carefully (which you didn’t), you would have understood that even in the improbable event that Carmat can’t have the DT (again really improbable, more a question of when), my model shows that Carmat would still be worth more than 36$ a share solely on taking into account the EU BTT market.

# 12. LAST WORD

It is important to understand that, currently, only 25 to 45% of the 180’000 yearly potential patients are surviving more than one year without the Aeson. 

It is not a comfort medical device, it is a necessity for all these people. 

There is no real competition and there won’t be before a long time. 

This product is the result of more than 12 years of research and studies made by worldwide specialists. 

In my opinion, it is really hard to see Karma(t) not succeed in the next few years.

There has been a lot of hype about NOK here recently along with some of the other recent favorites (such as GME, AMC, BB). As a long term investor of the asset, I just wanted to clear a few things up about NOK. Nokia is a telecommunications giant which makes most of its money selling and building network equipment, infrastructure, software, and services (only a relatively small amount of revenue comes from its mobile phones that we all know and love). In the simplest sense, the company makes money by selling massive amounts of network equipment and infrastructure to the mega wireless carriers.

&#x200B;

Relation to other meme stocks:

Nokia is COMPLETELY UNLIKE GME, AMC in the sense that it is not ""bound for the grave."" NOK flaunts a $24 billion market cap with a $26.1 billion revenue (number from 2019), and is operating with a free positive cash flow. The company demonstrates a healthy balance sheet and is in quite good form. This company will probably remain healthy for years and years to come. The company is not nearly as heavily shorted as the other recent meme stocks, which is a GOOD THING for long term assets. While heavily shorted stocks might offer the occasional opportunity of short squeeze, being heavily shorted is often a BAD SIGN for a company.

&#x200B;

Share price:

Although the stock's share price is low (which makes it accessible to many of us), that is not because the company is small or headed towards bankruptcy in any way. It's just a cheap share price, nothing more to read into. Again, this is a massive company that is quite healthy in a business sense. For all you newbies, more expensive shares do not have a direct correlation to being bigger or better companies (it depends on how many shares of that company are issued, etc). If you look at the past 20 years, yes the share price used to be higher a couple of times. NOK was one of the many tech stocks that was pumped then plummeted during and after the dot com bubble, and again during the '08 recession. At one point, the company looked like it may become a mobile phone giant as well, so the price was higher. But, Samsung, Apple, etc eventually beat them out in that particular market, so the company went back to mostly network infrastructure, which brought the share price back down to a more fair value. I actually think the share price is lower than it should be (not investment advice), which I'll get into next.

&#x200B;

Future outlook/earnings/5G:

I mentioned above that NOK has a positive free cash flow (FCF). This is a very good sign for the company, and one could argue that the share price should be much higher given . This is the company's 6th quarter now with a positive FCF. This past year the FCF was 1.356 billion EUR (can be found on page 14 of the 2020 Q4 earnings that was just released, see link here [https://www.nokia.com/system/files/2021-02/nokia\_results\_2020\_q4.pdf](https://www.nokia.com/system/files/2021-02/nokia_results_2020_q4.pdf)). One could very reasonably argue that with this FCF, the share price should be 50% higher (this article argues exactly that [https://investorplace.com/2021/02/nok-stock-is-now-worth-at-least-6-08-or-39-percent-more-based-on-fcf-yield/](https://investorplace.com/2021/02/nok-stock-is-now-worth-at-least-6-08-or-39-percent-more-based-on-fcf-yield/)).

Nokia is poised to continue making huge strides with the 5G upgrades that are currently being carried out to network infrastructures around the world. Better-than-expected 5G performance is largely the reason Nokia beat earnings per the report released yesterday ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nokia-reports-q4-earnings-beat-074251907.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nokia-reports-q4-earnings-beat-074251907.html)) It is true that NOK has lost  share space in China to Huawei, but it has more than made up for it with increased sales in North America.

Many analyst firms (so yeah, not just me) are expecting Nokia to continue making huge 5G strides. While Huawei and Ericsson are formidable competitors, there is plenty of room to expand as the world continues embracing the 5G wave. For example, Blackrock has recently upgraded its stake in Nokia to owning 5.9% of the company, which is a noteworthy investment considering their $24 billion MC (see this SEC filing from 7 days ago [https://sec.report/Document/0000834237-21-004596/](https://sec.report/Document/0000834237-21-004596/)). Blackrock is not the only one.

&#x200B;

tldr; NOK is not like the other recent meme stocks. It's a very large and profitable telecom company. The share price should be way higher with their FCF and outlook. They beat earnings and their future outlook looks great, especially with more 5G upgrades coming up. Investment firms like Blackrock have made massive (5.9% ownership) investments in NOK because they agree with this sentiment. EDIT: I own 1000 shares currently.

&#x200B;

NOTE: I am not a financial advisor, nor is this financial advice. I just like the stock and wanted to talk about it and share my findings with the rest of you.

The bottom line is that NOK stock is now worth at least 39% more, and as much as 68% more, based on its positive free cash flow (FCF).

This is now the sixth quarter that Nokia has been FCF positive. The company cut out its dividend last year until it could produce solid FCF and raise up its net cash.

Now Nokia management is saying they will assess their dividend policy. They will provide an update during its Capital Markets Day on March 18, 2021.

### FCF Positive and Forward Estimate

On [page 13 of the release of its Q4 results](https://www.nokia.com/system/files/2021-02/nokia_results_2020_q4.pdf), Nokia reported that its 2020 FCF performance was 1.356 billion EUR. That includes 778 million EUR during Q4, which was significantly higher than Q3.

For example, on page 12 of its Q3 results, Nokia reported that it has only made 319 million EUR in FCF. Therefore, its Q4 FCF of 778 million EUR was 144% higher.

Moreover, last quarter the company said it only forecast 600 million EUR in FCF, plus or minus 250 million EUR. The results came in at 1.356 billion, or substantially more than the high side of its forecast of 850 million EUR.

Keep in mind that last quarter the company said it did not expect to see heavy seasonal aspects to its revenue and earnings. In the past, a large portion of its sales, earnings, and FCF came in Q4. Therefore, we can use the Q4 number to estimate its FCF going forward.

But first, we have to make an adjustment. Nokia said that its Q4 FCF benefitted from an early customer payment of 500 million EUR. Therefore, on a normalized basis, this works out to 856 million (i.e., 1.3456 billion EUR minus 500 million EUR). That is close to the 850 million EUR it previously forecast on during Q3 (see above).

Going forward, even if sales decline a bit next year, as the company seemed to be guiding, its free cash flow could actually be higher. One reason is the company has identified 250 million EUR in cost savings that will bear fruit in 2021. This is seen on page 9 of its results.

What NOK Stock Is Worth

Therefore, I suspect we can estimate 900 million EUR to 1 billion EUR in FCF for 2021. If sales stay flat or rise, the gain in FCF could actually be higher. Note that this is lower than the 1.356 billion EUR recorded in 2020. (However, that included 500 million in payments that were brought forward by one quarter.)

Assuming 1 billion EUR in FCF, this roughly translates to $1.20 billion in US dollars at today’s exchange rate. Therefore, using a 3% FCF yield, NOK stock is worth $40 billion.

Compare that to its $25.66 billion market cap today. That implies that NOK stock is worth 55.8% more than today, or $6.82 (i.e., 1.558 x $4.38 per share today, Feb. 4).

Assuming its FCF is only 900 million EUR, that works out to $1.08 billion. At 3% the market cap would be $36 billion, or 40.2% above its present $25.66 billion market cap. That implies a price of $6.14

Even if the FCF falls to just 3.5%, the market cap would be 20.8% higher than today at $5.29 per share. Therefore, if we average the valuation of all three of these scenarios, the average price is $6.08 per share or 39% above today’s price.

### Alternative FCF Estimate

However, maybe I am being way too conservative. For example, in Nokia’s Q4 report on page 6, [they discuss the outlook for 2021](https://www.nokia.com/system/files/2021-02/nokia_results_2020_q4.pdf). One of the key sentences was this:

>*In full year 2021, Nokia expects the free cash flow performance of Nokia Technologies to be approximately EUR 600 million lower than its operating profit, primarily due to prepayments we received from certain licensees.*

This implies two things. First, we can use the operating margin percent from Q4 and apply it to sales forecast. And two we would deduct 600 million EUR from that to derive FCF.

For example, let’s take a worst-case scenario and estimate a 5% reduction in sales, from 21.867 billion EUR to 20.77 billion EUR. This is in the lower part of the range that Nokia provided of between 20.6 and 21.8 billion EUR.

However, we can use a 16.6% operating margin (from its non-IFRS operating margin seen on page 2 of the results). In fact, let’s use 80% of that margin, to be conservative, or 13.28%. After all, during all of 2020, its operating margin was just 8.6%, even though this included Covid-19 quarters.

This brings its operating profits to 2.76 billion EUR (i.e., 13.28% x 20.77 billion EUR. After deducting 600 million EUR, its FCF will be 2.16 billion EUR, or $2.592 billion. That is substantially higher than my earlier estimate of $1.08 billion to $1.2 billion in FCF.

### What to Do With NOK Stock

This brings the estimate for Nokia stock, using $2.592 billion at a 6% FCF yield to $43.2 billion, which is 68% above today’s price. After all, the company presently has a 6.3% FCF yield (i.e., 1.356 billion EUR, or $1.627 billion in FCF divided by its present market cap of $25.66 billion).

This implies a target price of $7.36, or 68% above its price today of $4.38. As a result, we have come up with a target price range of $6.08, 39% higher, to $7.36, 68% above today’s price.

In either case, this is a good result for most investors.

But if the share is in a cash account instead of a brokerage account, the broker cannot lend it and it becomes unavailable for shorting.

So if we transfer shares out of brokerage accounts and into cash accounts, that seems like it would (at least) make short loans harder to find and therefore drive up interest rates, or (best case) cause the broker to call back the share so the short is forced to buy at market price. If this were to happen *en masse* the huge volume of buying (forced covers) could drive up the stock price.

Now the shorts would be in a REALLY bad position: (1) stock price is high so their nightly interest payments balloon, and (2) interest rate is high because brokers don't have shares to loan.

So is it favorable for us to transfer out of brokerage accounts and into cash accounts to drive another squeeze?

It's quite simple once you know where to look.

**THESIS**

$GME and $HD trends have a causal inverse relationship. For the simpler tards, one stonk go up, one stonk go down. This is due to one simple fact... [LADDERS](https://data.whicdn.com/images/329053938/original.jpg). We all know the short ladders attacks have been relentless. However, the price per share this week has been the result of the infamous extended LONG ladder attack, as we are trending in a steady decline rather than big spikes and dips like last week.

**EVIDENCE**

I present the following charts. [$GME and $HD Trends](https://imgur.com/a/6AeUjJM)

Notice anything? Of course not, your retarded. Now look at these [LINES](https://imgur.com/a/z8I9BRu)

Makes sense now? No? Well there's no hope for you. Anyone who has a tiny wrinkle on their meat thinker, can see the trends. Just look at [THIS](https://searchengineland.com/figz/wp-content/seloads/2015/10/graph-line-trend-analytics-magnifying-glass-ss-1920.jpg)

Starting on January 25th, $HD was on a slow decline and $GME was slowly rising. Then what happened on January 27th? Huge spike in $GME, and huge dip in $HD. Coincidence? I think not. Who is the biggest supplier of ladders in the World? Home FUCKING Depot. Many [Sources](https://tylerpaper.com/ap/business/global-ladder-market-2020-2024-the-rising-demand-for-extension-and-platform-ladders-will-boost/article_63f44011-6b94-5856-b189-89a367877ce0.html) show that there was a limited supply of ladders on the 27th. This prevented any and all ladders attacks, allowing GME to initiate its FIRST gamma squeeze. But it wasn't over yet. On the 28th, $HD was scrambling for increased production of ladders, while $GME was heading straight to Mars. BUT THEN $HD secured a huge last minute ladder [contract](https://fjwp.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/23085906/contract.png). Allowing $HD to resupply those goddamn Melvins with the ammunition they needed to launch a massive METAL RUNG SHORT LADDER ATTTACK giving us a huge dip in $GME while $HD spiked. However the attack couldn't last long (because it's short you idiot) and $GME began its rise once again, while $HD was on the decline. As the trend continued, $HD made a last ditch effort on February 1st, to launch the infamous [Extended LONG Ladder](https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/9071561a-a2c0-4618-b79b-a3431507654c/svn/werner-step-ladders-e7410-64_1000.jpg) Attack. This took a full day to gain momentum but when it finally hit on February 2nd there was a big dip in $GME and an inversed spike in $HD now on the slow rise. You might be asking yourself, what's the difference between a long ladder and a short ladder? Well one is short and one is long you dim witted twat factory. The short ladder attacks result in quick spikes and dips. While the long ladder attacks have a slow steady decline, but if it is EXTENDED there is a huge initial dip like we saw on Tuesday. We are currently riding out the aftermath in the slow decline.

**CONCLUSION**

The trends clearly show this is all true. $HD is supplying ladders to Melvin's and $GME is suffering because of it. All of this is highly illegal of course, but the SEC will not stop this. They have been taking [bribes](https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/73667163.jpg) from ladder manufacturers for centuries. The only way we can regain momentum in $GME is to take down BIG LADDER. IF WE DO THAT, ITS TO INFINITY AND BEYOND. How do we do that?

Álamos gold is a junior mining company that's extremely high in assets ($3b) with only $100mil in total long term and short term debt. Not that debt matters in inflationary environments, but the short term solvency of the company isn't in question.

Look, we all know there is a massive run out of the dollar right now. And we all know people have two options-  digital currency, and metals. Clearly there are substantial proponents on both sides. I am not here to give you a whole run down on why gold and silver are a good long term investment, there are many reasons why that is true and you can read for yourself online.

Ii am going to give some VERY brief dd on AGi 

1. As I said, $AGi is underleveraged and high in assets. It can weather both deflationary and inflationary environments, but we forecast the latter.

2. Relative to other junior minors, AGI has some great return margins and posted a NI margin of 15% last year, also having $300 mil in capex (assuming this is investment into new mines).

3. Like other gold miners, AGI has a diverse portfolio of mines, mostly in Canada. 11,000 acres of land and expanding.

Analysts left and right are downgrading miners and prices are low across the board. AGI, though, has relatively cheap option premiums on their 6/18 calls, $3.15 for $5C with current price at $8.02 means you are paying a $.13 premium for a 6 month call that requires a 1.5% movement to breakeven. AGI has made that movement today alone. Highly confident gold will cover a decent movement this year. Are you prepared?

 6/18 $5c and 3/19 $7.5C."|2021-02-05 16:14:35.527273|../output/raw/2021/02/05/DueDiligence_flair_DD_161439.csv|DueDiligence|['AGI', 'WHY', 'YOU', 'HOULD']|['AGI']|['I', 'VERY', 'I', 'AGI', 'NI', 'AGI', 'AGI', 'C', 'AGI', 'C']|['AGI', 'NI', 'AGI', 'AGI', 'AGI']

So, if you were a bear shorting at sub $20, then see the price tick up to $40, maybe you double down, then we hit $60, and maybe you double down again. At this point $GME is in the news with 40%+ price swings attracting more bears. January 25 comes at this point and GME is at $100-150, Citadel is bailing Melvin out (because they doubled down and their previous positions suck at this point), and more bears are shorting. Then we enter $160+ territory, actually closing at $330, $260, $340 on January 27th, 28th, and 29th. These posts I mentioned come out on Feb 1, and it's clear that the shorts most likely need this to go back to $40-60 to either take their profit, or minimize their loss. Then we see all the manipulation resulting in the broker-dealers shutting down the buy side of the trade. 

Any short that entered at sub $20 is still currently looking at  a minimum 300% loss if they try and unwind now. Any short that entered at $40 is still looking at a 100% loss. But any short that entered at $60 or above, could have unwound by now, and then they have no interest in seeing this go down more unless they reload their short positions. However, they could crush other funds who entered at $40 or below by going long now.

I think the vast majority of selling pressure is gone because all of the late arriving bears with money to throw around probably unwound their position because the short borrow fee has plummeted from 30-40% to \~5%. Maybe someone else can provide some hard numbers for available shares to short and fees.

TL;DR: I think selling pressure is depleted because late arriving shorts have unwound their position. Those bears may be interested in going long to crush early bear funds.

TLDR AT THE BOTTOM FOR THE ILLITERATES

**This is the biggest SPAC of all time**. If you follow this ticker you know that this is a SPAC merger led by famed investor Bill Ackman. I’m not going to explain what a SPAC is, *learn to use google dumbass*. The company is yet to be announced but is rumored to be announced sometime in Q1 of 2021. Some companies that have been rumored have been Stripe (plz god), ***Bloomberg***, Fidelity, Chick-fil-a, Subway (lmao), WeWork, SpaceX (no lol), WaWa, and many many more. Make no mistake, you are investing in Bill Ackman’s ability to find a mature unicorn and once the announcement is made, that is the company that you are invested in. Keep in my mind, when acquisition is announced that company will get a 5 billion injection of cash, so going forward it makes for a healthy company.

So who the fuck is Bill Ackman?

You may hate the guy or love him, but you can’t deny that this dude is sharp as a fucking tack and knows his shit. He also gets to fuck on **Neri Oxmen**, *so that’s tight*. I’d say his notoriety comes from a few different events so let’s do a quick recap.

1. Calling the 2020 crash: You can say his doom and gloom prediction before the Covid crash was an orchestrated event, but either way he was fucking right and that matters. Obviously, I don’t need to tell you what has happened since then, I haven’t been to a bar in like a fucking year. ***But this was one if the biggest trades in history turning 27 million in 2.6 billion by using credit protection on investment grade and high yield bond indexes.***
2. The Herbalife short: You can watch “Betting on Zero” if you don’t know about this, but he shorted Herbalife and exposed them for their ***predatory practices and MLM scheme***. Here he was “right” but still lost the trade (so wrong). Had he never announced his position in this, he may have **hit a lick here**, but you must foresee adaptation and adjustment, so he took an L. Did Icahn fuck him here? Yeah, but you have to admire the research and the balls he had for this call.
3. Valeant airball: a huge shitshow in which Valeant was boosting drug prices and doing shady stuff. He lost 4 billion on this. Obviously not a great look and *he has to eat the full L here*.

A mixed bag when it comes to his reputation, but I believe he does his research well and that combined with his business acumen is why I have a heavy (personally) position in PSTH.

So how will this play out?

I’m not gunna go over every rumor in depth, but I’ll cover some that I like and some that I don’t.

Stripe: This is the one that every PSTH investor is up late *at night touching themselves to*. If it’s stripe this will explode and could easily hit **100** within the year (maybe even day). I personally don’t think it will be Stripe, in an interview about 6 months ago he said they weren’t ready to go public. Maybe by the time he announces they will be? Some people are saying that there is no chance of a Fintech merger, he hasn’t said anything that would make me believe that. Does he have experience in that industry? No, **but that doesn’t disqualify it.**

Bloomberg: **My personal prediction** and my 3rd choice if I had to pick one of the rumored companies. Ackman likes to dip his toes into political commentary and philanthropy, both of which Michael Bloomberg also does. I just think this is a good fit all around, he said he loves Bloomberg and has had an active subscription since the 90’s.

SpaceX: This is pure speculation; this would go absolutely parabolic. I don’t even know the heights that this stock could reach if this was to happen.

Fidelity: I’m not sure where some of these rumors originate from, but I think it’s because they are eyeing an IPO soon. I personally use Fidelity so I like this, it’s app could use an injection of youth and 5 billion could *definitely do it.* Pair this with the recent influx of people who are going to be leaving platforms like RH and other apps using the APEX clearing house and you have yourself a ***possible homerun***.

Chik-fil-a: The lords chicken. Any food chain mentioned is a possibility due to Ackman’s background in food chains. CF is a good company, but there is a lot of hype surrounding this SPAC, I’m not sure this would be a catalyst for a big move.

Subway: People laugh at this one, but it is the ***largest food chain in the U.S.*** That makes this play a little better but *still kind of disappointing* IMO.

WaWa: I don’t know enough about this company, I know it has a near cult like following so that’s a positive, but again, the biggest SPAC ever ends up being a WaWa? wack.

PornHub and Onlyfans: LMAAOO. No fucking way, but would it make money? **Instant meme stock makes for a massive pump.**

Wework: I don’t know enough about this company to have a strong opinion, but I’ve heard positive rumblings about it. This would be wildcard, I’m not sure how the market would react.

So how to play this? I don’t fucking know I’m not a financial advisor. I’m looking for Billy SPACman to take me to tendie town. Personally, I think he will make a great choice, so I’ve been building a LEAPs position for months now. I also own shares, for the warrants. It’s also crazy that we haven’t heard a **single reputable rumor and it has been MONTHS** now since the SPAC was announced.

TLDR; Let Billy SPACman take you to the moon on his STRIPed Spacex rocket ship from your Fidelity app. Lots of rumors here, you’re investing in the individual.

I shared my views on containership stocks earlier this week with a [note on these stocks here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l9unrf/containership_boom_ongoing/), but news is quickly improving even further, so it merits yet another update. Since last Friday, the top 3 picks in the container sector have moved up by a range of 24% to 32% (Danaos Corp, Navios Maritime Partners, Navios Containers). I listed the three largest cap names in the title since those are all over $1B and apparently anything under $1B = pump and dump. But AMC apparently wasn't?! Okay guys...

As I noted last week, rates for containerships (the ships which carry thousands of the 20-40’ boxes you see on railroads and trucks) have been going ballistic the past 4-5 months, but some of the stocks have stalled out and still trade at remarkably cheap valuations. For instance Navios Containers trades in the neighborhood of 2x my expectations for their 2021 earnings.

Link to the latest containership rates: [https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do](https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do)

The latest Harpex rates are posted each Friday morning. The new update that came out about 2 hours ago has them up another 13.2% for the midsize Panamax segment. This is a daily rate of $30,000 for the ships that hold 4,250 TEU (i.e. the ship can carry 4,250 20-foot boxes or a little more than 2,000 40-foot boxes). Remember the trains? Those are usually 40' on top of another 40' per each car.

As I mentioned earlier, I'm currently long about every name possible in the sector. The names remain cheap. However, obviously if stocks keep surging, I will take profits in a responsible manner on the way up. ""Dia hands"" is a funny/cute meme, but it's really quite dumb for investors. Do your own due diligence, figure out what you believe something is worth, and don't get greedy!

The 13%+ increase in mid-sized container rates exemplifies the strength for a firm like Navios Containers (which owns 25 of these 'Panamax' ships!), but we should also look at Danaos Corp, which just announced a [comprehensive refinancing](https://www.danaos.com/news-and-media/press-release-details/2021/Danaos-Corporation-Announces-Pricing-of-Senior-Notes-Offering/default.aspx) for the whole company.

This is a massive turnaround from a company, which was on the verge of bankruptcy just a year ago. After the refinancing Danaos has a very streamlined balance sheet with no major maturities until 2028. Don't just take my view of it! Randy Giveans, analyst at Jefferies, and someone I can personally vouch for as a competent analyst with strong integrity, ***just upgraded them to $40.00/sh***. I think he might even be too conservative on them...

I believe we're potentially just in the 4th or 5th inning of this run.

**Bottom Line:** Bullish on containership names, really the entire sector. Sticking to names with market caps over $1B for the rules here- Atlas Corp (ATCO) and Costamare (CMRE).

**Common Pushback:**

1. Aren't these rates just in a massive bubble and will crash soon:

The rates appear to be quite strong compared to the past 10 years, but if you look at a 20-year average and the strength of the 2000s, you'll see they aren't that far out of line. The past decade, and 2013-2018 in particular, was a horrible time for container ships. These are cyclical stocks sort of like automakers or airlines or mining. Furthermore, the rates we quote and discuss are rates for 1-year and oftentimes 2-3 year deals are being signed at similar levels of strength. These aren't just 1-2 month type 'spot' rates.

2) Is this like ""tankers"" I got burned there and I believe shipping sucks:

Tankers were earning literal all-time record highs last Spring, but these were just for 30-80 day voyages. Unlike containers, the rates were record highs, no prior precedent for long-term duration. Also, unlike containers, the duration was 30-80 days, not 1-3 years. Finally, unlike containers, the tanker rates were driven by a very short-term arbitrage due to collapsing oil prices. Containers were already strong in late-2019 on a major cyclical upswing before temporarily being interrupted by COVID.

3) Isn't all this rate strength only due to COVID-19 and will go away soon:

Containerships were already in a massive upturn during 2019 and into the very start of 2020. Then COVID interrupted all this and rates briefly collapsed. Yes, port delays and other issues from COVID are helping keep rates higher, but this isn't just a temporary dislocation like tankers, the rates were already strong without COVID.

4) Shipping is a horrible sector and nobody can every make money in it!

I hear this a lot. It's just not true if you have access to good research and are nimble with your positions. I've beaten the industry average for 6 of 6 years (2015-2021 YTD) and I've beaten the Russell 2000 for 5 of 6 years (all except for 2020 where underperformed). It is important to watch out for governance. DryShips was one example of a horribly managed firm.

5) Won't liners just order more ships and destroy this amazing market:

The average delivery window for new ships ordered today is between mid-2023 and mid-2024. They can order them sure, and some have been, but this won't make much of any impact on current rates/balance. The shipping world erroneously believed that midsize tonnage was obsolete (i.e. either go huge for big scale or go really small for niche coastal trades), but that turned out to be completely wrong. Therefore there were almost zero midsized ships ordered between 2012-2020 and the fleet is fairly middleaged to older on average. Fleet growth might even be negative in some areas.

***Disclosure:*** I’m long nearly every name in the space- Atlas Corp, Capital Partners, Danaos Corp, MPC Containers (on the Oslo exchange), Navios Containers, Navios Partners, and Zim Integrated. I have a medium-term to longer-term constructive view on this space, but I do take profits to rationalize my portfolio when things surge. ""Diamond hands"" is a dumb meme. If there's a lot of volatility, I might be a seller or switch positions (for example, I sold CMRE earlier this morning and rolled it into ZIM).

I have about 10% of my wealth in the Navios names. Average basis in Navios Containers is in the lower-$1s after buying a lot this summer at 70-80c. I previously sold 20% on 4 January at $4.44 and I sold 20% on 14 January at $5.49. I will probably sell another 15-20% in the $7s. I disclose all of my positions and trades in real-time (or as real-time as possible) on my research platform.

I know you guys can't read for shit, so I'm putting the **tl;dr** right here.

**tldr :** 

Donkey Kong's big dick swinging is gonna take us to the moon sooner or later. When you want to board the rocket is your choice. I've already strapped in and have my helmets on.

Retard play for the gamblers out there- 

**DKNG 70$ 2/12** \- To the moon or bust.

Safe plays for all the pussies out there -

**DKNG 70$ Jan '22**

**DKNG 90$ Jan '23**

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay now lets get to the good parts. Here are the catalysts - 

**SUPERBOWL is this week baby :** 

Do I care about the Superbowl ? Fuck no. Is Tom Brady still playing ? Fuck yeah. Pretty sure you've seen massive advertisements for DKNG this week. Superbowl for them is like Singles day for BABA or Black Friday for AMZN. You bet people and their grandmothers are gonna gamble. And they're gonna gamble hard. It's gonna be all over the news in the US, and you bet it's gonna be all over the world if Tom Brady wins another one of these. As is tradition, Donkey Kong is gonna come out next week, swinging his big dick, bragging about their numbers, which are gonna be higher than Snoop Dog on a Saturday. You know what's gonna happen next ? Hint, starts with F and ends with O. You guessed it right, FOMO over the hottest player in gambling right now - and that is where the money starts pouring in, enough to send us into orbit. This is also their first Superbowl as DKNG, and it is gonna be massive.

**Mommy Cathie is IN !** 

You bet mommy Cathie is into gambling. She has smelled blood and ARK is in ([https://citywireusa.com/professional-buyer/news/arks-cathie-wood-wagers-on-draftkings-wins-8-2bn-of-new-money/a1459266](https://citywireusa.com/professional-buyer/news/arks-cathie-wood-wagers-on-draftkings-wins-8-2bn-of-new-money/a1459266)). Let me quote here for you simps - 

> ARK Invest has taken its first position in DraftKings and believes that online gambling could grow by 10 times its current size.

You think Mommy Cathie is in it to get some boomer like 20-30% returns ? Hell no. She knows that gambling is coming to the United fucking States of America big time, and Donkey Kong is gonna ride that wave at the very front. After ARK's investment, it has already gone up 10%, and will keep on going up big time as other investors get in on it.

**Sports betting is coming to US big time.**

It is a well known fact that many states (especially Democratic ones) are considering sports betting as a way to raise tax money, since the Feds under the Trump government didn't give them shit for money all of last year. Hell, Cuomo was literally begging for some cash on television. Tons of state money got spent on battling the Coronavirus. Gambling is the easiest way to raise some cash that can be spent on fixing broken roads, schools, you name it.

This is a map of all the states where sports betting is legalized, or has legislation that seeks to legalize it. 

[https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/\_/id/19740480/the-united-states-sports-betting-where-all-50-states-stand-legalization](https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/19740480/the-united-states-sports-betting-where-all-50-states-stand-legalization)

Notice how **California**  is grey ? What do you think is gonna happen when the tech bros in San Fran get their hands on mobile sports betting ? What do you think is gonna happen when the frat boys and sorority sluts in Los Angeles and San Diego are gonna get their hands on it ? They're gonna gamble on their favorite teams like it's Las fucking Vegas. Hell now that you've imagined that, imagine what would happen **when motherfucking Texas** legalizes sports betting. Do you even know how crazy those Texans are about sports ? 

It should be noted that while **New York has legalized sports betting,** you can't bet using a mobile app right now, but Cuomo has been hinting about getting to that sometime soon. And that is gonna be massive.

Need I say more my fellow retards ? 

Mark my words, 2021 is the year of sports betting. **It is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when.**

Hop on this rocket as it is fueling up and enjoy the ride.

As you were.

Ok first off to the smooth brain apes that held. You may have more wrinkles than everyone thought. 

Once restrictions were lifted GME broke out! What does this tell us. 

First off you dipshits still haven’t moved your cash to another broker (fidelity possibly E*TRADE don’t do TD and webull shut it down again today as did RH I believe). 

Second once it was restricted it tanked again. 

Third and very importantly the market tanked during that time, this is very important. SPY lost $1.5 and quickly recovered once restricted again. 

What do these things mean? 

Momentum is not lost, there is still high demand for these stocks BUT we are still restricted because we aren’t moving our liquid capital to another broker. 

There is still a high percentage of short interest. If there wasn’t the whole market wouldn’t shit the bed if it was just retail running the stock up. 

The shorts are hard at work bringing it back down now that they control the playground again. 

My take away? This is still the play. Move your fucking money to a real brokerage this weekend and be ready for next week. Keep your shares in RH and the like, but stop any further transactions. 

Some of you wrinkle brained 🤡 made a shit load of money and sold before the huge drop. Obligatory Congrats and fuck you. But if you still want in this play toss 1/4 of your winnings at this discounted price. You get a second ride on the rollercoaster. 

This is going to/may be a long term play BUT if we move to a big boy brokerage house they won’t be able to stop it! 

This is NOT financial advice just a general observation of today’s events. Do your own DD and play only what you can afford to lose at your own risk.

Exro is a clean tech company that has developed a new class of controller that dynamically enables multiple power settings in a single motor making it faster, stronger, and smarter. Exro's advanced control technology, the Coil Driver, expands the capabilities of electric motors and powertrains by improving performance, efficiency, and reducing costs. Exro currently has 17 granted patents and 18 patents pending on its innovative technology.

Exro combines its patented software and hardware with in-house design, development testing, and final assembly at its Calgary Innovation Center for the most cost-effective solutions.

Exro is putting the intelligence into energy management and seeks to accelerate the global transition to clean energy.

I will summarize what I know and what I have learned from my investigation

1. As per CEO, their Projections are: Revenue should start from end of 2021. EBITDA +ve from 2023
2. Business model -> If its a low volume high value, they said they could manufacture themselves. If its volume business , they will either engage Contract manufacture it or do a licensing deal with OEMs who take care of manufacturing. Most business will be done in the license model
3. MOAT : They hold patents in different regions. They claim, each customer's work will be customized design for the customer and since their main work is software, they believe it will take years for someone to reverse engineer it.
4. Competitors - CEO claims no competition. The problem statement is widely known. My personal investigation to date suggest that there is/are other competitor(s) around, but they have their own solution. Question is, who has best efficiency & range and can they start commercializing it soon?

There are many ways seen to solve the problem :

i) Motor companies who use expensive Permanent magnet motors (made of rare earth metals). These are expensive but performance is great

ii) Semiconductor technology: Silicon-Mobility a French private startup, are working on same problem. Their solution is based on similar, software tech but this through semiconductors...Exro is micro controller but directly on the motor. Silicon-Mobility claims they can better performance & torque by 10-30%. Exro is also same or more. Silicon-Mobility do have couple of good partners (Valeo a auto ancillary and AVL autotech company). But IMO, they are a bit behind in commercialization, at least from what I know. It will be one to watch out for in future...if they ever go public.

End of the day, the electrification and solving the Differential Torque problem in Electric Car wont be solved alone by 1 company for entire world.

Exro has so many use cases and the opportunity size is huge.

Their current plan is to use these prototype partnerships and get the test benchmark data. Suppose Potencia testing gives benchmark data for electric car (converted from ICE by Potencia) and a electric Van. The data they get out of this testing will then be used and benchmarked against commercially available electric car data. If Exro finds enough proof that their tech is better, then they can go to the bigger OEMs like GM or Ford or whoever and get seat at the table.

If Potencia works, then Exro's target IMO should be likes of GM & Ford who want to do the volume business. They also have several partners listed on their site here: [https://www.exro.com/about-us/partners/](https://www.exro.com/about-us/partners/)

**The latest press release is super bullish**, and shows they are about to enter the commercialization phase with their first order of the Coil Driver - [LAND Electric Motorcycles to Order up to 2,000 Coil Drivers from Exro](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/land-electric-motorcycles-to-order-up-to-2-000-coil-drivers-from-exro-301222231.html)

This news came out of nowhere as LAND was not a partner previously, and today, the stock is hitting all time highs on this news.

That's probably what caused our early spike to the $95 before shorts panicked. Right now it's a fight between puts and calls at strike 60 to stay in the money. [Max Pain Theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp) says the longs and shorts will fight over their strikes with the highest volume as expiration approaches, ultimately making the the maximum number of calls expire OTM.

But there are 89,000 call options expiring friday from $60-$120 that MMs will have to hedge as the price increase. Shorts are going to do anything they can to keep it down below that to save themselves.

There are another 60,000 puts that are expiring today that market makers will have to unhedge as the price rises, also contributing to a gamma squeeze.

There are another 90k calls from $120 to $800 that are almost completely unhedged, but I'm also not expecting us to pump all the way up to the 800s to squeeze those so i've excluded them from the main numbers.

These are personal opinions/my guesses and not investment advice. I've also got so much GME that I can't do anything but stare at this stupid chart all day.


**TL;DR:** In total that's 15,000,000 million shares they'd have to buy today of which they've only hedged about 3 million so far (rough estimate based on eyeballing the delta). That's a whole lot of squeeze if we can find the juice.

From GameStop's last 10-Q filing in 12/20: https://investor.gamestop.com/static-files/a25f63ae-df8c-475d-b6a9-8747a1c79195

Number of shares of $.001 par value Class A Common Stock outstanding as of December 1, 2020: **69,746,960**

Latest news today from Reuters courtesy of S3 Partners: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gamestop-stocks-shortinterest/numbers-of-gamestop-shares-shorted-dips-further-s3-partners-idUSKBN2A51YX

""As of Thursday’s close, *25.4 million* shares were shorted versus 25.86 million a day earlier, according to S3. GameStop short interest, a measure of stock price and the number of shares shorted, stood at $1.36 billion.""

Let's for a second take the number provided by S3 Partners at face value. 25.4 million shares are currently still short.

Looking at the math:

Outstanding shares is 69,746,960

Reminder that the above *does not* include: insider ownership, public/retail (you, I, and everyone else), etc. We may not know the float, but we know the outstanding shares. The numbers just don't add up.

It's clear no matter which estimate you look at, the situation is dire since the shorts will eventually have to cover their postion. Maybe not all at once, but any catalyst/good news will only put more pressure with a steady trajectory up.  It appears the squeeze was gimped and an inevitable squeeze has yet to run its course.

Again, nothing about the numbers above have factored you and I into the picture, which you can imagine only compounds the situation. GME looks to be a ticking time bomb waiting to happen. Thoughts/comments are welcome if I'm missing anything.

First, some terms (skip if you know them):

#What is naked shorting?

The *illegal practice of short selling shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist. This practice is illegal because it places artificial downward price pressure on a stock and also because it has absolutely no basis in reality. You can’t sell something that doesn’t exist. 

[Investopedia on Naked Shorting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp)

#What is Failure to Deliver?

Occurs when one party in a trading contract does not deliver on their obligation. (e.g. I borrow shares to short sell that don’t actually exist, so I am unable to actually deliver the shares I am selling to a buyer)

[Investopedia on failure to deliver ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp)

#What is Short Interest? 

The number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out (i.e. returned to the borrower) 

[Investopedia on short interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp)

#How are these terms related?

While short interest and FTD are to some extent natural market phenomena, *there is a demonstrable correlation between high short interest, high FTD rates, and the existence of naked short selling for a stock.
[Predictors for naked short selling manuscript ](http://www.aabri.com/manuscripts/121208.pdf) 

Perhaps more importantly, the above article establishes that FTDs are not “random” occurrences, and are instead intentional and illegal actions taken by short sellers in some cases.

#Was there naked short selling with GME?

Almost certainly, yes. GME has been on the NYSE securities threshold list every trading day since December 8, meaning there were substantial failures to deliver for 39 consecutive trading days. The SEC is supposed to take action after 13 days per their own regulations.

[Source for securities threshold list ](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)
[Source for SEC’s regulations](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm)

Moreover, GME short sale volume has been extraordinarily high since December 8 (average short sales &gt;50% of total sell volume)

[FINRA short volume ](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-index.html)

#What does this all mean?

It means that someone(s) cheated by engaging in fraud on a massive scale and then doubled down on the fraud in order to protect overexposed short positions. And the SEC didn’t do shit about it. 

#Ok so they cheated, no surprise there, what can I do about it?

1) Submit a TCR complaint to the SEC [SEC complaint form](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)

2) Contact your local, state, and federal representatives and tell them that you are very upset."|2021-02-05 16:14:35.527273|../output/raw/2021/02/05/DueDiligence_flair_DD_161439.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['DD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'FTD', 'FTD', 'GME', 'GME', 'NYSE', 'SEC', 'GME', 'FINRA', 'SEC', 'I', 'TCR', 'SEC', 'SEC']|['FTD', 'FTD', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

This might not be the quality DD you’re used to. English is not my first language and im fairly new to WSB (lurking for about 4Months). I personally own shares of this stock!
Ok with that out the way lets get down to business. 

TAAT lifestyle and wellness is a company which produces Cigarettes made out of CBD. I see great long term potential for this company. 

They are still fairly small but provide a good alternative for cigarettes. The reviews of the TAAT Cigarettes were very positive but unfortunately since i don’t live in America i couldn’t try them myself yet. They currently work on bumping up the production and currently produce 5800 Rods of Cigarette packs per day, which comes out to around 144000 per month, which is an estimated 5,76 Mio. USD per month. Obviously this isn’t even comparable to big Tobacco companies but the are currently searching for even more production facilities to bump up the production even further. So there is still a lot of Potential for Growth.
The stock also had a fairly good run growing 387% in one year with a lot of buzz around the stock the past week causing a 89% increase in one day. The hype died down a little bit and is thus Investment worthy again without having an for this stage overvalued stock price.

Their current expansion strategy involves sending out TAAT cigarettes via their only store to spread market recognition. This initiative is called TryTAAT and from what i gathered is pretty successful.
Im in on the long run and see a lot of Potential growth for this company."|2021-02-05 16:14:35.527273|../output/raw/2021/02/05/DueDiligence_flair_DD_161439.csv|DueDiligence|['TAAT']|[]|['DD', 'WSB', 'I', 'TAAT', 'CBD', 'I', 'TAAT', 'USD', 'TAAT', 'TAAT']|['CBD']

**Here's my argument for Peloton:**

They just had their earnings yesterday and it dipped almost 10% in the AM and is on a **sharp recovery** mode. They far exceeded top line and beat all metrics - **the reason for the dip?** **Due to such high demand,** Peloton warned that it will face supply constraint. I like this kind of problems because the **reward for overcoming such issue is great given the amount of risk.** APPL had similar issue for iPhone 12 and it figured it out. AMD and NVDA is currently facing these issues. 

Why I like Peloton's business model is: 

There's a high investment to buy a unit. Once you reel in the customers, they need to pay monthly subscription. This is a great cash flow model similar to NFLX, COSTCO, etc. However it's even better because people will continue to pay for subscription after sinking in $3k for a peloton bike. 

I mean it's like a cult man... 

I'm still holding GME but that is a long term play for me and I need some excitement in the near term.

TLDR: The core idea is that GME's stock price benefits tremendously from momentum and popular interest. There is very obvious evidence that the two were correlated over the last couple of weeks, but I posit that they are causally related. I think I have evidence of two things:

1. Momentum is rising
2. Popular interest is rising

Finally, I argue that momentum and interest are causally related and that the recent correlation has some underlying explanation that utilizes both points above. This is not advice, I just like GME. I have shares and options (02/12 $305c!). Also, I have no idea what I'm talking about, feel free to correct me. 

&#x200B;

The data:

1. Google trends

2. volume:

&#x200B;

Search interest, stock price and volume are all correlated over the last few months, and especially so in the last week. It would be nice if we had finer resolution search data because we could see if the buying over the day is granularly correlated with google search volume (indicates that the two are causally related).  The first figure in 1A shows search interest over the last month in the US with daily ticks. I see a big spike when we were in the 300s last week, then a sharp decline, and the appearance of a recovery. Daily interest appears sustained, elevated, and growing. The second figure in 1A shows hourly ticks over the last 7 days, blue is the search term 'gamestop' and red is 'gme'. I see that interest in the stock was steady between the end of last week and the start of this week, if anything it peaked a bit higher on Monday. I also see that public interest is fading (the blue line probably approximates public interest, non investors who don't know the symbols). However, the red line is still spiking robustly, which I interpret to mean that people who are actually investing in the stock are still checking it out. Of course there is probably a mixture of GME shareholders and non-shareholders who still use the term, and you can see the baseline move a lot over time. My guess is the red signal can be decomposed into at least two components: the baseline (mostly non-shareholders) and the daily spikes (shareholders). I have the most confidence that the yellow line (term='gme stock') is mostly shareholders and it appears much more constant (shows a much smaller difference between last week's peak and this week's peak). All of this leads me to conclude that interest in owning the stock is starting to become uncorrelated from the media's reporting and is actually still likely increasing. 

2A shows the monthly price, volume, and change with daily ticks. 2B shows the last 5 days with minute ticks. I believe that both charts show that the volume is increasing again.  I think this is because restrictions were lifted and perhaps because uncertainty at the beginning/middle of the week is starting to dissipate. It appears that investors were still trying to play the early morning swings this week and interest in trading the stock picked up during the week. All of this supports my conclusion that buying interest among retail is recovering and setting up to spike again at the beginning of next week.

&#x200B;

Momentum is in part generated by trading volume and sustained price movement. You can clearly see in 2A that there are two phases: a green phase in the beginning and a red phase after the spike. Green days are more likely to be followed by green days and red days are more likely to be followed by more red days at least in the short term. However, dynamics can shift and the trend can flip. Today appeared to show evidence of that flipping and I believe it indicates we are more likely to have a big green monday. The morning price spikes have been getting larger over the last couple days since the restrictions are up. I think these spikes will keep getting bigger and bigger through next week. As momentum increases and those spikes get more reliable, people will be less afraid to hold through the day and the feedback continues until short meltdown.

5 x Jan 20 2023 HRB $25C

I have a feeling that I'm going to be ridiculed for this ""deep value"" play, but alas, here we go:

I'm buying HRB leaps for these reasons:

\-I'm betting on a major pivot that will severely impact their valuation. Last year, they took on 3 executives of Information Technology. [LINK](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/02/17/1985861/0/en/H-R-Block-advances-transformation-strategy-with-new-vice-presidents.html) Additionally, their acquisition of Wave Financial in 2019 (Social Capital invested in this company in 2012) signals a paradigm shift within the company.

\-HRB tends to lag behind others in terms of SP recovery following a major market crash, but always come roaring back two-three years afterwards. (year 2000, 2012) There appears to be some correlation between economic recovery and people needing help with their taxes. I also view the rise in young people investing as a bullish sign for HRB.

\-Attractive fundamentals. I'm not wrinkly-brained enough to explain this in detail so do your own DD. I will mention that H&R Block's main competitor (TurboTax/Intuit) is valuated as an SaaS (P/S ratio of 13+) while H&R Block is valued as a brick and mortal boomer tax preparation company (P/S ratio of 1). If H&R Block can successfully make the strategic transition from a Brick and Mortar to an SaaS, or at least something in between, I believe HRB could be a multibagger.

I know how much some of you guys love soon-to-be expired options, so ill list them first before any DD. 90% of you arent gunna read it anyways, although i know you would if you could.

I picked up 640 10c for 2/19. They were 5$ each. The stock is at 8.99 as im writing this and up .40$ from yesterdays low. These are cheap as shit. This is a very low volume stock and i havent seen it mentioned on r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, or r/options. So im mentioning it there in all 3. 

This is not financial advice and you should do your own research before buying anything, let alone short dated options. You dont have to buy them for this play, im just explaining how undervalued they are. 

10c for 2/19 (14 days) are $.05
10c for 3/19 (42 days) are $.20.
12.5c for 3/19 are $.10

*They have over 24,000 employees, brought in 5.88B revenue in 2019, and have 35 manufacturing and design locations worldwide. Theyve been in business for 27 years. https://www.celestica.com/news/media-information

*Their most recent earnings, released jan 26, 2021, show an earnings of 0.16$ per share, as opposed to a loss of 0.05$ per share last year. This means that they were profitable during covid, and found ways to adapt and overcome the challenges the pandemic brought to many companies. 

*They have an “undrawn $450M revolver” as they put it on their site, or $464M in cash. https://corporate.celestica.com/static-files/e9830936-130f-44f6-9f73-3127402c00d5

So what the fuck do they do? Yes.

Celestica Inc.
Celestica inc. Is a provider of supply chain solutions. The company operates in electronics manufacturing services. The company offers a range of services to its customers, including design and development, engineering services, supply chain management, new product introduction, component sourcing, assembly and testing, complex mechanical assembly, systems integration, precision machining, order fulfillment, logistics and after-market repair and return services. Its products and services serve a range of applications, including servers, storage systems, optical equipment, aerospace and defense electronics, healthcare products and applications, semiconductor equipment, and a range of industrial and alternative energy products including solar panels and inverters. It designs, manufactures and tests solar panels for residential, commercial, and utility scale markets.

Im in this for the clean energy, innovative tech, supply chain, and aerospace. Theyre involved with lots of other things as well that make them a good play imo.

We all know biden has lots of plans for clean energy(looking at you ICLN gang), and that its a main focus of many governments around the world. They have 6 locations in China, 2 locations in South Korea, and 3 locations in Japan. These countries are leading the world in tech and clean energy. They also have 4 locations in California, and a few other locations throughout the US. Basically, theyre positioned perfectly for exposure to tech funding and innovation.

I can also see this being added to a few of the ARK ETFs, including the new space one, ARKX.

Their linkedIn page is full of jobs, they are looking to hire many different types of engineers and employees for product solutions. They pay their staff relatively well, (avg 60k per year with 32k/yr being minimum for warehouse staff.) The reviews from employees seem decent with an average of 3.5 stars on Glassdoor and 3.9 on indeed. Theres also real pics on there of people wearing lab coats in front of some fancy looking tech shit, which is very promising.

I dont know how to add pictures. 🚀🚀🚀
The only reason the chart dipped recently was due to the GME situation, there was no bad news and they are already back to approaching highs since pre-covid. Im assuming a certain few institutions had to sell to cover their margin call. Before the march crash, the stock peaked at 9.29. At the bottom of the crash, it was trading at 2.63. Since then, they have rebounded back to over 9$ per share and are approaching pre-covid highs. Their 2019 earnings were negative 0.05$ per share, and their earnings for 2020 were $0.16 per share. Again, this means that they went from losing money pre-covid, to being profitable during.

Reasons I believe the stock is undervalued:
Very low volume in such a promising tech stock to me means that not many people know it exists, or that the company is dogshit. This company is not dogshit. A dogshit company is not spread globally with over 20k employees bringing in nearly 6B$/year in sales.

$CLS holds a P/E ratio of 8.86, while its industry has an average P/E of 17.83. 

$CLS has a P/B ratio of 0.77. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 
1.79. This alone makes them very undervalued.

$CLS has a P/S ratio of 0.19. This is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue, or sales. This is a useful metric on low volume/unheard of stocks, because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. CLS has a P/S ratio of 0.19. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.31.

* CLS has a P/CF ratio of 5.83. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 6.35.

Please let me know if you find more/better information, or if something ive said is incorrect.


Tldr: $CLS is a tech/clean energy company involved in many promising industries. They are undervalued in every sense of the word, and their options even more so. They have extemely low volume due to being unknown, but are by no means a dogshit penny stock. Stock is currently trading at 9.03, and 10c for 2 weeks out are $.05. Yesterday they opened at 8.73, found resitance at 8.60, and climbed to 8.95 at close. 

Positions (again): 640 x CLS 10c 2/19.       🪐

Listen up retards: it is mathematically impossible for shorts to be covered by now. If it was possible to cover like that do you think short squeezes would EVER happen?

It’s simple. Let’s use the worst possible numbers here.

Jan 15 226% of the 51 million floating shares were shorted. 51 million x 2.26 = 115.26 million shares. Let’s say they shorted the shares at $5. They borrowed at least 576 million dollars worth of stock to do that. Over half a billion just to set up this short.

Now people are saying they covered by shorting at 300, 400, 500. Ok, let’s say they covered at 300. You’re telling me Melvin was able to come up with 300 x 115.26 = 34.5 billion dollars loan to cover their massive fuck up? Even if they covered HALF the shorts at 100 per share we’re still talking about 5.75 BILLION US DOLLARS JUST TO COVER THEIR ORIGINAL FUCK UP and they would’ve had to fabricate THREE TIMES as many FAKE shares as they did in the first place. Remember 226% short over float? It would have to be 452% now to cover.

Hold your fucking shares.

Edit: I am not a financial advisor and this post does not constitute financial advice. I used my cell phone calculator to do this math.

Edit 2: I know I shouldn’t be surprised you retards don’t understand simple math but let me try to explain this to you: if I short a stock at $5 and it goes to $100, I owe $95 to the lender. If I short again at $100 and it drops to $5, I made $95. My net gain is a big fat fucking **ZERO**. If I short again at $100 and it goes to $50 my net is 50-95= *-$45* Not to mention the interest rate on that short position, which if I’m getting for less than inflation means the lender is paying me to borrow money.

Please get your head out of your ass. **if it were possible to cover a short squeeze then a short squeeze would never ever happen. The reason short squeezes happen is BECAUSE THEY CANT COVER.**

So first off its trending up. Up 1000% since November and is up over 100% in the last month
A month a go this stock was worth 4 cents and yesterday it closed at 1.6 and opened at 1.5, at the time of this post its sitting at 1.9.

Secondly 
Zom is a company that is working develop and commercialize pharmaceuticals for pets like dogs and cats. On top of that they are speeding up diagnostic processes for veterinarians. This could completely the game for veterinarians making their jobs easier and making things less stressful for pet owners. Lots of people have pets lots of people their pet. Pet care seems to be a huge market estimated at around 10 billion dollars

Thirdly 
Zom has signed an agreement with Miller Veterinary Supply for the distribution of Truforma, Zomedica’s first product, planned to begin sales on March 30.
That should send the price to the moon hitting in my opinion at least 5 dollars.

Lastly 
There is also some hype behind it due to the Netflix series Tiger King not that this is a meme stock but I feel as if this will make more people aware of the stock and bring more traction to it

I am more than open to comments and criticisms and I would genuinely like to hear your thoughts on what is going on with $GME.

After watching $GmME and the broader market trade the last few weeks I've become convinced that we have the power to move the market, the ""smart"" know this and they are scared.

**Firstly evidence for our power to move the market and what I have witnessed:**

* [https://www.tradingview.com/x/hDWiOq9W/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hDWiOq9W/) \- this chart compares $GME vs the $VIX over the last few weeks, they have been trading in near unison and increase in $GME cause a spike in the $VIX
* [https://www.tradingview.com/x/0Zb1wzhg/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/0Zb1wzhg/) \- Furthermore we have seen how sharp spike increases in $GME can cause sell offs of the broader market (S&P 500). Exhibit A and B demonstrate the quick sell off in the S&P as GameStop ""MOONS"". I don't have any evidence however I would liken this to the raise in margin requirements from brokers and clearing agencies. This caused a quick sell off as positions were liquidated to meet margin.
* [https://www.tradingview.com/x/v738Nol0/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/v738Nol0/) \- Volume Profile:  A lot of the buying/selling column appears to be repeating which just seems odd, they don't on other days. Perhaps it was some shorts that had reloaded closing out a position or perhaps a larger buying getting in? I don't know too much about this so if someone could inform me that would be sweet!
* [Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations (sec.gov)](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf)  \- This document describes the techniques that could be used to, "" circumvent certain requirements of Regulation SHO"". It is really complicated but to the best of my knowledge it describes complex options strategies that can be used to artificially appear to covering. The shorts could be using these strategies to ""Reset the Clock"" and be simply buying time.
* Furthermore S&P Capital IQ is showing the there are still 61.8 million shares sold short as of Feb 03, this is down from Jan 26th however it is still ridiculously high and larger than the overall float, which I'm sure we must have close to 5-10% of that held by heroes like you.

* Lastly I will add that I have seen an increased volume and open interest in $VIX calls dated for February 10th that have strike prices much higher than its current level. This coincides with the February 9th sort interest data that will be released the day prior and will likely have an impact on $GME stock. Given that we have seen increases in the price of $GME are mirrored by the $VIX, I believe some ""smart money"" has details on the SI data and as such is hedging or looking to profit from an increase in the $VIX.

Now what does all this mean. I believe that their is truly some shady shit going on behind the scenes. There is information we don't have access too, we may never but it seems like something is happening. Their is most certainly some kind of suppression at play and Wall Street didn't want us at this table. They may be slowly trying to unravel their short positions without causing any disruptions and that is why they wanted us out. It's also very possible that their are funds working both with and against us. Either way this is a pressure cooker that gonna that's gonna blow.

I'm thinking of punting on Bumble (which will trade with the ticker BMBL) when the shares go live on 11th Feb. I'm writing this DD live as I'm fact finding, but here's my take on it.

**Personal experience:**

I've never needed to use a dating app personally, but I have numerous friends who absolutely live by Bumble and I've seen that it works long term (plenty of fun dates, followed by matching up and eventually marriage). My female friends who have used it love the fact that it is woman led and initiated, meaning they don't get inundated with belligerent sex pests like on other platforms, and the guys I know who use it like it because it means that there is less pressure to ooze sex appeal (that they arguably don't have) and be more honest in their profiles. It seems like a far cry from the clear market contender Tinder. As a product, if I were ever in the ""available"" in *that* market again, I'd probably consider using Bumble myself.

**Previous valuations:**

* Between 2016-2018 they were approached with multiple offerings of $500M - $1B \[1\]. Their revenue in this period ranged from $10m in 2016 to $190m. This means they were effectively trading at premium multipliers of between 50 (early on) and 5 (in 2018).
* In 2019 they were bought by Blackstone by $3B \[1\]. Their earnings for this year were $240m, meaning they effectively traded at a revenue premium multiplier of 12.
* We don't have 2020 numbers, but in 2018 there were 35 million users and this year there are 100 million users. I would imagine that their earnings have taken a hit this year with COVID (i.e. lockdowns preventing hookups) but this just means it might be a great opportunity to buy in now.

**Some other considerations:**

* It has been reported that dating app usage actually went up during lockdowns \[2\] which does seem to defy logic. So potentially this might mean a nice surprise at the first public earnings announcement.
* 5 million use it in the US \[3\] - which is some way behind Tinder despite having a very similar market offering. This means that there is growth potential in the user base in the US, and presumably elsewhere in the world too.
* As a long term hold, this has potential: most of the users of the app are aged less than 35 and this is a replenishing stock of potential customers from below.

It looks like trading will start at around $30 a share and a market capitalisation of between $6-8B. To put this in perspective, Match (who own Tinder) are currently valued at $41B - and they made $2.4B in revenue in 2020. This means Match current trades on a revenue multiplier of 17.

Assuming that Bumble can scale 2018 earnings with users, 2020 might see revenues of around $600M. If this is the case and they can attract a similar multiplier, this puts the potential market capitalisation at something like $10.2B. This means that the price could, in relatively short term after first reported earning period, increase to between $38-50. Of course beyond this there is still plenty of scope for increasing the size of their user base, and with it additional revenue in the future.

None of this is advice, and because this hasn't been previously listed it isn't so clear to see the long term valuation of the company and could easily be wrong and it tanks immediately. But I will be buying when the bell goes on the 11th because I think it is worth a punt.

Last week there were a lot of people hating on the posts about silver going up. These people instead pumped stocks like $GME and $AMC (which went down 75%). There are real reasons why silver is going to go up.

First of all, physical silver is becoming more and more difficult to get by the day. Currently an ounce of physical silver will cost you anywhere from $34 - $40. This is $7 - $13 over paper silver prices. It makes you wonder why physical is going up so much when the paper market is still staying flat/going down.

There is manipulation in the silver market by big banks such as JPM and Goldman Sachs. COMEX can just create paper silver contracts out of thin air, which keeps the silver prices down. The COMEX cannot possibly fill all of the open interest on the silver futures contracts. That's why when silver started to go up last week, they raised the margin requirements on the contracts by 18%, forcing larger players to sell when they received margin calls.

With all the money printing going on, and rates being held near zero, its hard to believe that the price of silver is fairly valued. I believe that all this money will eventually find its way into silver, just like it found its way into the stock market."|2021-02-08 10:36:58.317678|../output/raw/2021/02/08/DueDiligence_flair_DD_103659.csv|DueDiligence|['$SLV']|[]|['$GME', '$AMC', 'JPM', 'COMEX', 'COMEX', 'I']|['GME', 'AMC']

A DD I found previously on WSB from u/drrona but aligns with my TA findings as well. Thought I’d share here as I believe it shows a great buying opportunity for AMD especially in the next coming weeks.

# Fundamentals:

Their latest ER:

**Crossed $3 billion in sales threshold for the first time, INCREASING YOY by 52%**

**Full year sales of $9.76 billion**

Server revenue doubled year over year which is absolutely incredible.

Massive increase in guidance. They’re **expecting 37% growth** this year.

So why did they drop from their ER? Well, it was because of next-gen chip shortages through the first half of 2021. But let’s be real here, this is a joke compared to the issues Intel is facing with their next-gen.

Obviously, we’d prefer if they never had a shortage, but I mean if you’re gonna have a problem it might as well be this one. This news is LITERALLY SAYING, “hey we have too many orders and we can’t keep up sorry, we’ll get it to you ASAP”

Imagine thinking this company isn’t going to bounce back and go to new ATH in the next month or two.

Our queen, Lisa Su, said “there will be added capacity” in the second half of the year. This is perfect, because that means by the time next holiday season comes around they’ll be good to go. I wouldn’t worry about these shortages. They are running at full capacity and we should expect their sales to increase throughout the year.

**Some loser (**u/aatop**) decided to call out Market Share issues in my last post so here's a section just for him:**

Intel gained back 0.7% of market share in Q4 across the CPU market as a whole. Whoop de doo!

**In the last month ALONE, AMD gained back 3%.** Here's a little business lesson. Ups and downs happen. No growth company is going to have growth every single month/quarter. I don't care who they are. There are hiccups. Don't let some negative nancys make you believe that a hiccup means AMD's market growth is ending.

**AMD actually GAINED on Intel in the CPU server secto**r. What does that tell you? That **boomers are actually converting to AMD** for their company. And we all know that these boomer companies have all the money for now.

# Technicals:

For those of you who care about lines on a chart, I got you as well.

We really have two things to look out for. We have a resistance (that used to be a strong support) at 88. But we’re basically there right now.

In addition, the last few weeks before ER, we were in that 89-97 channel. What does that mean? Well, once we get going here **AMD will shoot up to $97 and from there we can retest ATH.**

https://preview.redd.it/49t9dzxqghf61.png?width=1988&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=9a45e5768cdd5fad74cfa67b2544f46065135d47

For more squiggly lines, the MACD is about to cross the signal line so we could see some bullish sentiment here. And of course the RSI is near the bottom of the range, but honestly who cares about that anyway.

**Positions: 4/16/2021 100c, 97.5c 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

This is not financial advice. I am not a professional. **I just really like the stock.** 

* 

 *My positions are **19 Feb 21 90c** as I expect a leg up next week or the following into the 95$ territory range (expected profit - 150% if it hits 95)

*Buy stonks for a great long term hold as I expect this to probably moon to 130-140 range by EOY to early next year specifically near Q3-Q4 earnings.

Currently UFO is the only space exploration etf in the market, and has only been around a year. Options just became available last week due to the rising volume. 

Since the announcement we’ve seen spce make a huge run. Spce was an obvious choice but there are many other companies set to be bought up. Cathie like to have ~50 companies in her etfs. Speculation which companies she decides to add can be tough, so this is why I’m playing UFO. There’s likely to be several gems that can easily 2x or 3x in the coming months if not more. Once we have more details and announcements on ARKX, hype will go way up from where it is now. 

Here’s a few other reasons why UFO is both a value and momentum play:

Satellite, tourism, and telecom are now economically viable thanks to the decreasing launch costs achieved by spaceX. 

Location based ride sharing king and food delivery are rapidly growing because of the power of satellite-enabled navigation. 

The formation of the U.S. Space Force.

I am re-posting for visibility and because I believe the message should be shared, particularly at this junction in time. If you've seen this post before, I would appreciate an upvote for visibility)*

TLDR: **Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered, specifically an illegal method/loophole to ""cover"" their shorts with synthetic long shares generated from the use of options**. Full details below.

There’s an insightful piece on [TradeSmithDaily](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) that identifies two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.

The first scenario is from retail investors not holding the line and panic selling, driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.

\*\*

From TradeSmithDaily:

Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out… Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.

\*\*

The second scenario is where hedge fund short interest in GME didn’t really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further “breaking the squeeze.”

\*\*

From TradeSmithDaily:

The way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market.

The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013.

The SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.” You can [read it here via the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).

The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here’s a quick rundown:

* If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.
* A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.
* The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.
* This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.
* As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.
* The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.

It gets very complicated, very fast. But the gist is that **hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered, and can’t, for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes** that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.

Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:

***“Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.*****”**

\*\*

In short (no pun intended) these tricks “help hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren’t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located”. Which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)) and Michael Burry’s (now deleted tweet viewable here [https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en)) about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.

These factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren’t really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to “cover” short positions they shouldn’t have had to begin with because shares were never properly located.

If this is true, and as explained there are signs that indicate it is, this would allow short side funds to prolong their short positions indefinitely. This inspires a thought experiment, **if funds are able to prolong their short positions with this method, wouldn't it make more financial sense for them to prolong their shorts rather than truly cover and close out their shorts at a -500% to -5000% loss** when prices were at 300-400 last week (when they supposedly closed out a majority/large amount of short positions)? The saying for stocks goes ""its only a loss when you sell."" The version for shorts would be ""its only a loss if you close out your short positions.""

Another factor to consider is there are well reasoned posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/) and [here](https://pastebin.com/AuhuKJu4) (now a pastebin, originally a popular post from a reddit user) that present the argument that, mathematically speaking, shorts could not have afforded to truly cover the majority of their positions. Based on this logic, if shorts could not have afforded to truly cover most of their positions, it may have made the most sense for shorts to only cover their most underwater positions and prolong the majority of remainder shorts positions with the help of synthetic longs. The end goal being to wait for retail interest and stock price to go back down before truly closing all their positions (though FTID/phantom shares caused by the synthetic longs may be another complication for shorts to close their positions.)

In addition, one point that may be relevant to explore is if a large amount of short positions were indeed truly covered, there would theoretically be immensely strong buy pressure to drive the price of the stock up. Instead, during this past week when shorts supposedly covered, price of the stock somehow went into a free fall. Why? Something to think about.

I would be remiss to mention that another data point that may be of significance is that an entity recently purchased 43 million dollars worth of 800 dollar call options to expire in March ([screenshot from a WSB post](https://preview.redd.it/b21gob6z5ze61.png?width=1788&format=png&auto=webp&s=615555f4e98da988c49a89ea5991d6c7063ff7a9)). In practical terms what this purchase may seem to indicate is that whoever made the purchase believes there's a chance and risk the price of the stock could shoot past 800 by March, which would also suggest that they believe a squeeze is still possible and are hedging for it. If you happen to believe this entity is a hedge fund then you may draw your own inferences from that as to what that could mean.

In considering the potential use of synthetic longs by shorts to prolong their positions we must also consider the possibility that shorts may no longer be under as much pressure as they were before to cover. What can retail investors do in that case? Two thoughts come to mind.

**A) One recourse retail investors could have would be to encourage GME to issue a reverse stock split as it forces borrowers to return shares back to their holders, which in theory would put the naked short sellers in a compromised position. If you care about forcing the issue, you can follow the instructions** [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/gm2tsnw/)

**B) Another recourse would be to bring the matter to the SEC's attention for investigation, which you can do at** [**https://www.sec.gov/tcr**](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)

Sidenote: On the subject of synthetic long shares, another instance where they came into the story recently was when S3 Partners released it's GME short interest % calculations last week, from a short interest from on 122% on 1/28 Thursday to 113% on 1/29 Friday) to 55% on 1/31 Sunday, which many found to be suspicious. Later it was discovered that number of 55% was calculated using the same data set that yielded 113% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of including synthetic long shares into the short float equation, which is against standard practice but which S3 abruptly decided on Sunday to make their new main metric of SI%. Many questioned the logic and timing of this decision. One consequence of this decision was that the media picked up on the ""new"" short interest percentage of 55% and spread it as a new narrative during market open on the morning of 2/1 Monday. Whether this influenced subsequent buy/sell behavior, and if so to what degree, is something to consider.

If you think about GME as a battle between short side funds and retail investors (there are likely other players involved but for the purpose of this analysis we'll focus on these two), information plays a major role and there is an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side. For example, hedge funds know the positions they're in and can share data with each other whereas retail investors are in the dark about many important data points. An example of an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side is the unavailability and general inaccessibility of true real-time short interest percentage. A lot of retail investors are waiting for the short interest report on February 9th to help inform them of their next moves, but while this report is a data point, the data in the report will still be two weeks old. With that said, examples of what investors have available for estimating the immediate short term interest are things like short interest borrow rate and calculated inferences from other data points.

There's an adage oft repeated on WSB that retail investors can stay ""retarded"" longer than funds can stay solvent. The ""paper hand"" sell off earlier this week in part appears to contradict that statement. To explore it from a different perspective, if you consider the possibility that short side funds are taking a long term play (on their short positions by extending them with synthetic long shares), then so far it would seem that funds can stay solvent longer than paper hands can stay patient (case in point being the retail sell-off when the price started dropping.)

At least one lesson that could be draw from this is that the better retail investors understand how hedge funds think and operate, the better it will benefit them in navigating this situation intelligently. An analysis of events of the the past week leads me to believe hedge funds deployed at least three tactics from the Art of War:

* **""Deceiving and confusing the enemy is a more effective path to victory than openly fighting with them.""** I personally believe the press release from Melvin Capital on 1/27 about closing their short positions was an example of this, they wanted us to believe their short positions were closed thus ending justification for the short squeeze.
* **""If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles.""** Hedge funds knew the weakness of the retail side was the lack of cohesion and leadership (by nature the lack of leadership was a disadvantage for any leader to the movement may be accused of manipulating retail buyers and scapegoated) and they knew that if price drops low enough many retail buyers will panic sell, so all they needed to do was attempt to drive the price down via whatever methods at their disposal whether thats through misinformation, calculated and continuous shorting, short ladder attacks ([read this for an explanation on how 'counterfeit shares', which are a form of synthetic shares created from naked shorts, can be used to ladder attack the stock price](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/), which also supports the thesis of large amounts of counterfeit shares currently being in play) and other potential methods.
* **""If his forces are united, separate them""** aka divide and conquer. Upon driving ""weak-hands"" to sell-off this divides the retail buying group and creates bears out of some ""paper hands"", who then spread their views and further the divide. Another example is the silver fake news/manipulation and the very real possibility of bots sent into this sub to push a message and sow division.

I will leave you with that, and a reminder to do your own research, for as investors we do not have all the information available, and the most we can do is intelligently speculate with as much data and logic as we can gather. I wrote this post because I spotted some inconsistencies within the GME stock that in my opinion, once brought to awareness, would either be irresponsible or willfully ignorant to not examine further. If you agree with the ideas explored in this post, feel free to share with whomever you'd like, and thank you for your part in raising awareness.

In January they acquired Vigtory, a sports betting startup, and will integrate it into their streaming platform this year. Entering 2021 FUBO has \~500,000 subscribers, with 80% year over year growth, and a market value of \~$5 billion.

These numbers mean two things: First, **FUBO has a proven product** with traction and growth. Second, it has **just started to penetrate a massive market**. While there are many excellent companies in the streaming and sports betting space, most are already past this growth phase. ROKU has a market cap of $55 billion. DKNG has a market cap of $25 billion. PENN has a market cap of $20 billion. This is why all the analysts are excited about FUBO. **It is much easier for FUBO to go from $5 billion to $50 billion over the next few years, than a competitor to go from $25-$50 billion to $500 billion which is Facebook/Tesla level.**

There are still 80 million Americans who have yet to cut the cord, who can probably save money today by switching to FUBO. There are 30 million Americans who have cut the cord, and can add live sports with FUBO while the bars are closed. All of them can spend a lot more money on FUBO once betting is up, since the Supreme Court struck down the federal sports betting law in 2018 in Murphy vs. NCAA.

Combining a $100 billion a year streaming/cable market, with a $20 billion a year and growing sports betting market, means enormous growth prospects for little FUBO at $400 million a year revenue and 80% year over year growth.

At $50 a share, FUBO’s valuation is about $10,000 per subscriber. This is about 10x the Netflix valuation of $1000 per subscriber. This might seem high, but it is in fact a fair valuation for several reasons. First, it is a $65 per month product. Second, it has increased its advertising revenue 153% last year to a small but significant $7.5 million. Third, sports betting could make a large percent of FUBO subscribers 100x more valuable than the typical streaming customer. Fourth, Netflix has 200 million subscribers vs FUBO’s 500 thousand, meaning more value can be imputed to growth. Most importantly, all these reasons are still applicable even if FUBO grows another 50-100% for the next few years. FUBO’s customer lifetime value (CLV) is probably already above the norm, and can moon with more advertising and gambling. That is why many are confident that FUBO can be the next ROKU, and reach $200/share or more in the next few years.

In fact, **at $50 per share FUBO’s price/sales is \~45, compared with 56 for DKNG and 35 for ROKU, despite having better growth prospects.** This means FUBO can probably sustain a higher price today, even before news over the next year validates the growth thesis. And there might be short squeeze! (See other DD for that).

As always with investing, I invite counterpoints and criticisms/holes etc. of my pov.

Start with valuation - What should be the forward multiple for a stock like this. Practically every social media names trade at ~50+ forward multiple, each of course with diff verticals/growth rates/opportunities obv.

Mega cap names are trading at ~30 or so. Google is about there, msft and aapl are a tad higher and amzn trades in its own level largely due to bezos and what he's created etc.

The market trades at 22x.

Facebook trades at ~21x.

Of this forward multiple (its expected earnings), one can presume there isn't much contribution from whatsapp due to the egregiously low multiple of 21. (no one is expecting whatsapp to suddenly monetize to the extent it produces ~2,4,10 billion in revenue in the next ~handful of years.) Analyst expect 12.5~ eps in the next year, this gives the ~21x.

Lets break fb into parts - fb/insta/whatsapp (lets just assume oculus/vr doesn't surmount to anything).

whatsapp purchased for ~20b..insta 1. We know more about insta's contribution and with its greater growth and higher monetization (2/3rds of new add growth) we could probably assume it with at least a 30-40 multiple, what...200b market cap (snap is 100 and insta has 4x more users etc. I think 200 is conservative and fair, Id say more but w/e..200). Whatsapp has now over 2 bil users, likely ~2.5. This also would trade at 30-40x at what? 100 billion? Again, I'd say more, much more actually but let's just go with that right now.

This is important now -- fb is 750. They hold 70~ in net cash so the biz collectively is worth 680.

Insta is 200, whatsapp is 100...fb would be left with the remaining (BUT let's not forget there are efficiencies gained so let's say that in totality is worth 30 or w/e). We're left with FB, just facebook worth 350b. Now its a waste of time to discuss fb's reach and its continued growth etc etc because we should all know that already.

HERES THE BIG POINT - Assuming insta is worth 200, whatsapp 100, and as said above, their multiple is 30-40 (which I guarantee you would be the case considering every social media company and most tech names with growth similar to these --------- facebook would be left at a 350b valuation with a what...~10-15 forward multiple.

Now, who the fk would think a company the reach of facebook.com, the #4 downloaded app ahead of snap regularly, with growing users every year and stable users in n/a & eu ..with growing arpu YoY..should trade at 12 forward earnings.

Mark my words, fb will do what apple did, it will do what mu has recently done, it will be re-rated and the st will shortly forget the arguments of why fb traded at 20x while the market and all its peers are trading 50% higher. Break fb up (it wont happen), by all means..these stocks alone or together, are worth way more than 750.

Now as for apple and whatsapp very quickly and maybe I'll comment about it more in detal if people converse about it.

Apple - Unity just reported (with 50% ads, much less targeting ability than fb) apple should impact 6% or so of their revenue. Snap's guidance and commentary didn't seemed concerned. Facebook, as analysts and others have suggested, are likely going to lose 1-5% revenue. This equates just 3-4 months of pause in the stock, if not less, it's not this glorified terror that is going to ruin fb. It's nothing. no one will actually care after it passes lol.

2nd about whatsapp. whatsapp has like 60% or so of india's smartphone uses and in a few months, are going to announce their 'super app' integration with that big retailer I forgot the name, look it up if you care. They are trying to replicate wechat and become an app where people message each other, call each other, purchase food, purchase clothes, buy airplane tickets, show snap stories, etc. And they will also have facebooks data of those .5 bil users as well to help with suggestions/ads etc. TLDR - whatsapp is going to contribute 200-300 billion in market cap to fb in the next 3-4 years thru actual monetization.

The ONLY case you can make for fb trading this low is that you think it will be replaced 10-15 years from now or w/e..In which case, it shouldn't reflect this much in the stock as of right now. ONCE they show notably, real declines in users, stagnation in revenue, etc..we can panic and trade it closer to the market, but that is NOT the case right now. What will happen is - facebook will begin to trade closer to its peers and even more when they see continued growth in their top line - which will come from whatsapp's domination of india and maybe even brazil? Also, in 10-20 years, those weaker countries will start growing more in arpu, which would be HUGE for growing fb's top line. Something I've learned is - snap/tiktok, twitter, reddit, discord, netflix, youtube, insta, fb, can ALL live among each other. Each offers its own utility to each user. The harder would be for tiktok/snap to break into fb's territory rather than the other way around. Fb/insta 'profiles' will be here 20 years from now.

TLDR: I think fb is going to ~double in 3 years and triple in ~5. It should be at least 30% higher than its current price."|2021-02-08 10:36:58.317678|../output/raw/2021/02/08/DueDiligence_flair_DD_103659.csv|DueDiligence|['$FB', 'DD']|['FB']|['I', 'I', 'BUT', 'FB', 'HERES', 'THE', 'BIG', 'POINT', 'I', 'Y', 'I', 'TLDR', 'ONLY', 'ONCE', 'NOT', 'HUGE', 'ALL', 'I']|['FB']

The below is my opinion. Do your own due diligence.

Thanks to  [u/yimiemie](https://www.reddit.com/user/yimiemie/) for making me aware of this stock back at $6.67. It mooned, as he projected.

**What is Himax**

 “Himax Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: HIMX) is a fabless semiconductor solution provider dedicated to display imaging processing technologies. Himax is a worldwide market leader in display driver ICs and timing controllers used in TVs, laptops, monitors, mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality (VR) devices and many other consumer electronics devices.

Himax has 3,009 patents granted and 561 patents pending approval worldwide as of December 31st, 2020. Himax has retained its position as the leading display imaging processing semiconductor solution provider to consumer electronics brands worldwide.” 

**Q4 ER**

They smashed it. Oddly, the company released pre ER Q4 data and everyone just ignored the great news because of reasons. Then Q4 came and their guidance added fuel to the hot numbers. 

From the ER press release:

"" Q1 2021 Guidance: Revenue to increase by 5% to 10% sequentially, Gross Margin is expected to be 37% to 38%, IFRS profit per diluted ADS to be 30.0 cents to 34.0 cents, and Non-IFRS profit per diluted ADS to be 30.1 cents to 34.1 cents.""

They are telling you they'll moon. Telling you!

**Semiconductor constraints, right? AMD, right?**

Again, from the horse's mouth:

""Have **succeeded in securing more capacity for 2021** as compared to the level of Q4 2020 when Company reached the recent peak quarterly shipment. Expect the **total capacity available to Company to increase quarter by quarter in 2021 and will continue efforts in acquiring more capacity**. Also **secured a meaningful capacity increase is automobile where the global shortage for semiconductor supply is overwhelming**.""

So the company won't face the same constraints. Actually, they'll have more capacity.

**Who are their customers**

Samsung, LG, Lenovo, Huawei, Panasonic, Amazon, Sony, Mercedes, Jaguar, Asus, FOXCONN (come on), Google, and so many more.

**Catalysts**

Do you need more than their 2021 guidance? It's not secret the world is going EV. It's also no secret EV uses large displays instead of dinky nobs. Put 1 and 1 together.

**Value**

 HIMX trades at a big discount to its industry at 1.5X forward 12-month sales vs. 5.1X. (from Zack's). This was when the stock was $9.90. Going by their math, to get to the industry average, the stock should have a price point of $33.66.

Yeah, there's still room.

**Positions**

5,000 shares

100 03/19 $7 calls

**TLDR:**

HIMAX has given great guidance for 2021. Stock is undervalued already. This company will continue its rocket powered flight.

I was trying to find up to date Short Interest values for all of the recent 'reddit/wsb/meme stocks', as CNBC and others like to call them.

I just wanted to share what I have found and I hope the information is valid. I'm not looking to persuade anyone any one way. I'm not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. Did I miss anything? I'm an ape. Moon. Rocket. Diamond Hands.

So I came across the FINRA 2021 Short Interest Reporting Dates, found here: [https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest)

""FINRA requires firms to report short interest positions in all customer and proprietary accounts in all equity securities twice a month. All short interest positions must be reported by 6 p.m. Eastern Time on the second business day after the reporting settlement date designated by FINRA."" On January 27th, trading became restricted by a few brokers for GME and other stocks. On January 28th, RH restricted trades for the entire trading session, and many days after. However, on January 29th, firms had to report their short positions. This information will become public on Tuesday, Feb 9th. I'm not sure what time this will happen. Also, I'm not sure what the position will show from the January 29 reports. Were the positions recorded at different times from different firms? Were they recorded at closing hours? 6pm as well? Hard to tell.

Regardless, what I see as important here, is that at some point Tuesday Feb. 9th, we will have an updated Short Interest value. Until then, I wouldn't trust any sites values. i.e Finviz, which has shown the same 121% short float % for the past 2 weeks? Because I assume they too are awaiting the reports from FINRA. Does Bloomberg Terminal have access to this information somehow? After all, this data was reported on Feb. 2nd. So the information is out there somewhere.

I started a free-trial on: [https://www.ortex.com/](https://www.ortex.com/) and from a report on there, I found the short interest values that were reported on Dec. 31, 2020 and Jan. 15, 2021.

https://preview.redd.it/xz08amp573g61.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=38fd7c8c3fca875c14f7a2586b3462342feafd06

I have no idea what the short position will hold for Jan. 29th. I also have no idea how to interpret the Days to cover column. If anyone can provide anymore information I will update this post.

**tl/dr:** Short Interest Values should be updated on Tuesday, February 9th. Not sure what time. We'll know for sure if the squeeze is coming by then, if it hasn't happened before then.

Almost all of these posts make huge mistakes that debunk their whole argument. It's really unfortunate to read an essay of what the OP claims is DD and then realizing that the OP didn't spend 5 minutes making sure the claims he's making make sense or are accurate. So here is my attempt to debunk the big posts. I won't be spending too much time on any one post. Usually the posts have dozens of little mistakes and addressing them all will take hours. So I'll just cover the main problem of each.  






**Number 1: ""15 U.S.C.A. § 78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks (Legal insight)""**




>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laferl/15_usca_78i_the_illegality_of_short_ladder/





This is the biggest thread about it but any post the mentions a ""short ladder attack"", ""ladder attack"", or ""short attack"" fall into this. ""Short ladder attacks"" and ""ladder attacks"" are NOT real and are not a term you see anywhere other than WSB and a single SeekingAlpha post by a crazy person. Short attacks are real but literally everyone on WSB is using the word incorrectly. It means something completely different from how it's being used.




This is what a short attack is:







>https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/11/27/short-activism-the-rise-in-anonymous-online-short-attacks/











>https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp 






Just shorting a stock a lot is NOT a short attack. Actual examples of short attacks are Citron's ""research"" which scares investors into selling their stock. You can even view Bill Ackman's short of Herbalife as an attempted short attack since he was public about it which made investors fearful (temporarily). This has not occurred with GME recently. Obviously Citron was shorting it for a bit but the claims of short attacks have been much more recent than that. None of these claims talk about what was occurring weeks ago with Citron because when they say ""short attack"" they mean something completely different from the actual definition. 





Also, the trading strategy that people talk about when mentioning a ""short ladder attack"" or ""ladder attack"" does NOT even work. Think about for even a second. For this type of price manipulation to happen you need either do it to a stock with almost no volume or you need to trade enough to be responsible for almost all the volume. For the last 2 weeks the lowest daily volume for GME has been 40 million. With many days having a volume double that. So, the first possibility is out. The second possibility assumes that hedge fund are willing to trade BILLIONS of dollars of stock back and forth on a daily basis. That makes 0 sense but let's say that's true just for the argument. The goal of this supposed strategy is to artificially lower the price. Most hedge funds did not short GME and have no reason to allow this strategy to happen. If BILLIONS (or millions) of dollars of the stock are traded at artificially low then the rest of Wall Street would just buy these shares and make a profit. Thus, moving the price back to equilibrium. It is impossible to manipulate a stock price with this strategy if the volume is this big. 






**Number 2: ""GME Institutions Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze is not Squoze""**






>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/








>I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. ~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.








I've already explained what short attacks mean so this is a perfect example of a completely incorrect usage of the word.









~~Also, the site the OP linked shows shares that are available TO BE borrowed. It does not show when shared ARE borrowed. So, it actually shows the opposite of what OP thought it did. Which means his whole argument is incorrect since it depended on this to make any sense.~~





~~I go more in depth about that here:~~
~~https://ns.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/le7syu/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float/gmaru31/~~



**EDIT #4 - 7PM: The second part of my argument is incorrect. I assumed the website worked in a way that it doesn't. I only realized this after tinkering a bunch. If you're interested in exactly why I was confused here's a link to a discussion I had which made me realize my mistake:** 



https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leram1/blatant_mistakes_in_almost_all_of_wsbs_dd_over/gmixka6/






**Number 3: ""Why $GME short interest appears to have fallen when in reality it has not.""**







>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lag1d3/why_gme_short_interest_appears_to_have_fallen/







Short interest does not change when short-sellers hedge with options. Short interest is the number of shares sold short divided by the number of shares outstanding. Buying an options contract does not just change either part of that equation. Short-sellers can hedge with options and lessen/eliminate their losses from their shorts but this does not change short interest at all. The OP has a fundamental misunderstanding of finance. 











**Number 4: ""https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lals8v/todays_price_drop_was_100_artificial/""**









>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lals8v/todays_price_drop_was_100_artificial/









Again, an incorrect understanding of short attacks. The SeekingAlpha post linked is a literal conspiracy theory as is the ""CounterfeitingStock"" website. There is a reason why it the ONLY website claiming what it does and does so without any proof. We do not know the author or their background/credentials. The thousands of academics that study markets have never talked about or written a paper about ANYTHING the website or the SeekingAlpha post claim. It was given 0 attention for years until WSB found it and now posts about it every 2 seconds without ever reading the contents of it. It is the equivalent of a 9/11 or JFK conspiracy website.   








Also, the OP claims that malicious naked shorting occurred. There is 0 evidence of this. Nobody that has a background in economics or finance believes this. Just the conspiracy theorists on Reddit. Does it naked shorting occur? I'm sure to some extent it does. Does it occur on a level that has an impact on markets? Nobody has evidence of that and there are a few papers on it. Did it occur here and was it malicious? No reason to believe that it occurred on a large scale or that it was malicious. 












**Number 5: ""How There is No Mathematical Way Shorts We're Covered for Jan 13th, 22nd, or 25th with GME's 69.75 Million Outstanding""**



>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/




Of all the posts I've included this is the only one that has an OP that isn't making blatant mistakes off the bat. Not that there aren't mistakes. But, they're MUCH more forgivable than the others. 








OP's whole argument depends on the FINRA short volume numbers being correct. However, they are not and FINRA even warns for people not to use them to as a proxy for short interest. The numbers include any time a firm decides to sell its own shares so that it can fill a customer's sell order easier. This is relatively common so you can't use these numbers to show actual short positions. This is why the numbers are so off  compared to any third party estimate. I talk more about this problem here : https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/gmfoih1/
























**Number 6: ""GME FLOAT 177%. Apes with the Bloomberg terminal please keep us updated with the numbers.""**












>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leby2i/gme_float_177_apes_with_the_bloomberg_terminal/










So, there's actually not anything directly wrong with the OP since it's just a post of a Bloomberg terminal. The problem is that its obvious that the OP as well as everyone commenting assumes that ""177% of float held"" means the same as ""177% short interest"". This is obviously a very weird mistake to make. It doesn't mean that short interest is 177%. It means that intuitional investors own 177% of float of GameStop. Which is something completely different. Obviously there is a reporting error because institutional investors don't actually own 177% of all outstanding shares. The reasons for this are explained here: 




>https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp#:~:text=There%20are%20instances%20where%20investors,from%20short%20selling%20between%20investors.









**Number 7: ""S3 Partner's ""S3 SI% of Float"" Metric is Total Bullshit and Here's Why""**





>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbydkz/s3_partners_s3_si_of_float_metric_is_total/








I explain why this post and posts like it about S3's data is completely in this post towards the bottom: https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5b8i/updated_short_interest_numbers_for_gamestop_gme/






Basically WSB confused the short interest calculation with S3's own short interest calculation. They have always done both and have always reported both while labeling them correctly. WSB confused the two and thought that S3 had changed the way they were calculating short interest. This never happened. They have always calculated short interest the same way. 






**Number 8: ""It is mathematically impossible that GME shorts were covered: some simple math for simple gamblers""**




>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le4c62/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/




The original post was removed but I've seen it reposted a bunch. If I find one with the original text I'll link it. Anyway, I talk about the mistakes of this post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldgn9a/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/gm66hgf/




**There are plenty more posts that are completely wrong or misinformed. But, I already spent 1-2 hours typing this out so I'm done for now. I'll get on later to answer any questions if any come up.**





TLDR: Almost every single post that makes claims about the markets, data, or GME do not know what they're talking about. These posts have many mistakes and don't ever have an argument that makes logical sense. Do not believe any post on WSB unless you actually did the work and researched everything an OP claims. Including me.









**EDIT #1 - 2:45 PM: Here are is a bit more info on failure-to-delivers and naked shorting:**








>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leram1/blatant_mistakes_in_almost_all_of_wsbs_dd_over/gmhufze/.











>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling









>A study of fails to deliver, published in the Journal of Financial Economics in 2014, found no evidence that FTDs ""caused price distortions or the failure of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis"". Researchers studied 1,492 New York Stock Exchange stocks over a 42-month period from 2005 to 2008, and found that ""greater FTDs lead to higher liquidity and pricing efficiency, and their impact is similar to our estimate of delivered short sales.""








To clarify: Naked shorting occurs and causes failure-to-delivers. However, there are many other causes. A high number of FTD's does not mean any illegal naked shorting occurred. The point I'm trying to make is that there is no reason to believe that something shady has occurred with GME in terms of abusive naked shorting.





The FTD's should be investigated just to make sure. But, I don't think a large amount of FTD's is evidence of abuse.

With the economy opening up after COVID, there's no way there won't be a surge in the need for oil. This is even more true for natural gas which is used in energy production, giving USAC a solid boost.

At present, USAC is trading below $15, where before the start of the pandemic it was trading at highs of around 18, representing about a 20% gain. The stock has had steadily increasing profit margins over the last 3 years, increasing despite the pandemic, from -96% to 5%. The stock has had its dividends increase over the past 3 years as well, and now provides a relatively stable dividend yield of 14.05% per annum.

From a technical standpoint the stock is quite strong. It has good upward momentum and has recently broken above its 20 day moving average (maroon). The ichimoku cloud is currently below the price and green (lead 1 (light green) is above lead 2(red)), and the lagging span (dark green line) is above the price, suggesting strong support for continued upward movement of the stock in the future.

I would argue that this stock is a relatively good short and long term play. It's good for playing short term recovery of the stock to pre-pandemic highs. It's also good for playing on the massive influx of energy demand once things start to return to normal, with the support of good momentum on its side. In the long run, boomers could even make decent profits from the growing dividend yield of this stock.

[http://www.usacompression.com/](http://www.usacompression.com/)

TLDR; USAC is a natural gas and energy stock currently selling 20% below pre-pandemic highs, that also offers good dividends (stable 14.05% yield). Good prospects based on increased energy consumption once the economy reopens.

**Sources used:** RKT investor relations website and company website, RKT earnings transcripts, SEC fillings, the SEC EDGAR database, sea king al pha, whalewisdom, finbox, yahoo finance, stockcharts, openinsider, Zacks, google sheets.

**Summary**

Rocket Companies (RKT) is a fintech company that operates several brands including the flagship Rocket Mortgage. I think RKT presents an opportunity to buy serious value at a cheap price, because the market has not priced in the underlying fact that RKT is a tech company akin to Square, Paypal, etc.

* RKT has disrupted the lending industry and has embraced a fully digital ecosystem, which will continue to drive customer acquisition and retention in the future
* RKT spends considerable money and resources on UX/UI development, client experience, and marketing. This will also help drive their continued expansion into the lending market.
* The RKT “ecosystem” provides a “full cycle” solution for everything related to real estate transactions and insurance. They serve real estate professionals looking to generate leads, develop those leads, better serve their clients, and make every stage of real estate transactions smoother. From the client side, they similarly just make everything easier - it’s an app, it’s online, it’s doable from home and it’s not complicated. There’s an inherent advantage in what they’re doing here because closing on real estate transactions has always been something that’s complex, unpleasant, expensive, and not well understood. You need lawyers, you need agents, there’s a ton of paperwork, it sucks. RKT is changing all of that.
* RKTs balance sheet, income, and liabilities support a stock price several times higher than the current one in my opinion.
* RKT is currently stagnant in price, and the market appears to be pricing it like a traditional mortgage company, not a rapidly growing tech company (which they are).
* RKT has been around for decades (skips the startup costs that will provide barrier to entry for newer companies looking to do what they’re doing), but somehow seems to still be leading the tech charge in the industry. That’s a unique and potent combination in my opinion.
* RKT needs a catalyst to get the market to value it as a tech company instead of a lending company. Once that happens, and I expect it to sometime within the next year, RKT should approach an appropriate valuation such as 20x earnings. That’s an estimate I pulled out of nowhere, but is commensurate with the low end of P/E ratios for companies I see as similar to RKT.

**Key Point - RKT is Priced Like a Legacy Mortgage Company**

The average estimate for 2020 year end revenue is $15 billion, and the yearly earnings estimate average is $3.85 per share. 

This estimate gives a forward-looking P/E ratio of just over 5.5. The sector median is something like 8-12, which makes RKT cheaply valued relative to the earnings it produces, *even compared to the financial/mortgage sector*. What’s key here is, I don’t think that’s really an appropriate comparison. I would place them more in line with companies like Square (ttm P/E ratio of 325x lol), PayPal (ttm P/E ratio of 69x, nice), or Fiserv (ttm P/E ratio of 24x). I used Zacks for all of these P/E ratio lookups. 

Let’s assume RKT is conservatively worth 15x earnings, and that it hits the estimate of $3.85 eps. **That would put its fair value** ***right now*** **at $57.75 per share.** I think it’s worth more than that but, we all should do well to remember that it’s really only worth whatever the market will pay for it. 

**Key Point - Catalysts**

This thing needs a catalyst. Right now I am loading up. I’m buying shares, I’m selling SHORT TERM covered calls to reduce basis on those shares, but I will be stopping the sale of those covered calls within a couple weeks most likely. The Q4 earnings announcement will be on 2/25. I am not sure that the actual earnings numbers will be enough to wake this thing up, although I expect them to be good. But if that announcement comes with discussion of their focus for 2021 and beyond, and gets the market thinking about them as a tech company first and mortgage lending company second, things will start to heat up. I don’t know when the real catalyst will hit that triggers the run-up, but I think it could start with the Q4 earnings call. I am looking at $21 as the floor for this stock, and I expect the price to double within a year. I will be acquiring OTM LEAPs, expiring next spring.

Supporting information and background follows.

**The Business**

RKT is in the business of providing solutions to financial transactions, including mortgage origination and refinancing, auto lending, and more. Specific subsidiaries and my simplistic view of how they interact:

*Home Financing*

* Rocket Mortgage - The mortgage company. This is a prominent “public facing” part of the Rocket ecosystem.
* Amrock - Amrock provides title insurance, property valuations, and other solutions. I see this as “supporting infrastructure” to keep clients within the rocket ecosystem where they would otherwise need to go elsewhere and is part of what makes RKT a one-stop-shop. 
* Amrock Title Insurance (ATI) Company - basically does underwriting for Amrock. The “business end” in my simple understanding of the world. 
* Nexsys - provides a streamlined approach to the closing process with their Clear Sign and Clear HOI technologies - taking care of closing day authentications and sharing of homeowners insurance information.
* Lendesk - Lendesk specifically provides solutions for the mortgage market in Canada
* Edison Financial - Basically the “front end” of Lendesk that Canadian clients would interact with.

*Home Sale and Search*

* Rocket Homes - Rocket Homes is a proprietary home search platform and real estate agent referral network. Basically this matches buyers, sellers, and agents, and is a key aspect of keeping clients completely working within RKT for all aspects of real estate buying/selling/financing.
* For Sale By Owner - A digital marketplace designed to let clients buy and sell real estate on their own. I think it’s absolutely brilliant that RKT owns this, but more on that later.

*Auto & Personal Financing*

* Rocket Auto - Supports rental and online car purchasing platforms.
* Rocket Loans - online personal loan solutions for clients.

*Media*

* Core Digital Media - a major advertiser in the mortgage, financial, insurance, and education sectors.
* Lower My Bills - this company is basically a “portal” business model that connects people with providers of various loan and insurance products.

*Services & Technology Development*

* Rock Connections - Basically a sales and support platform that handles appointments, prequalifications, generating leads, and data analysis among other things.
* Rock Central - I will generalize this as “business support”. HR, administration, etc.
* Rocket Innovation Studio - A tech incubator to gather and engage top talent and ideas.

**Recent Acquisitions**

RKT, through Lendesk, acquired Finmo back in October of 2020 ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-subsidiary-acquires-fast-182042594.html?guccounter=1&guce\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce\_referrer\_sig=AQAAALnvnNBoglSnmMP0O61AqgXBJokNS53LjJYuG3NvYKhayp4I6ZH2RpfmFUbSsCAU4xmnBNGMTwiEG-Ly29EabVy1-OjPIGfkYoQ3389gn3Edebs9sIwWOy1tPzqjRwOwwGA\_PWg0cNzEFCe7HBTilMwADUT\_y0QxWw8vizWecGcv](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-subsidiary-acquires-fast-182042594.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALnvnNBoglSnmMP0O61AqgXBJokNS53LjJYuG3NvYKhayp4I6ZH2RpfmFUbSsCAU4xmnBNGMTwiEG-Ly29EabVy1-OjPIGfkYoQ3389gn3Edebs9sIwWOy1tPzqjRwOwwGA_PWg0cNzEFCe7HBTilMwADUT_y0QxWw8vizWecGcv)) Finmo is a rapidly growing Canadian digital mortgage platform and this acquisition I think was perfect - it shows RKTs dedication to embracing a fully digital experience, and making sure they’re the ones leading that charge.

**Management**

I do not have much to say here, aside from this. The RKT team is not the new kids on the block, they have decades of industry experience. Also, I value leaders that make people feel valued. And on that note, under CEO Jay Farner Quicken Loans has been in the top 30 of Fortune’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” list for 17 consecutive years.

**Financials and Growth**

When it comes to the numbers, RKT is killing it. I don’t want to just spout a bunch of numbers that anyone can easily go look up so here’s a couple that stood out to me from the Q3 earnings announcement and related data:

$4.63 billion in revenue, which is 163% YoY growth. 

From that revenue, they beat EPS estimates with $1.21 for the quarter vs $1.09 expected. 

Net income was $2.4 billion which represents a YoY growth of 365%.

Closed loan volume YoY growth was 122% to $89B.

Net rate lock volume was $94.7 Billion (101% growth).

RKT has brought in $13.1 billion in revenue in the first 3 quarters and seems to be on track to close out Q4 with yearly revs above $15 billion. 

That’s awesome but what I really like is that they pair this amazing growth with **$3.5B cash on hand**. That’s great because I want them to be able to scale as they grow, and make acquisitions as needed (see Finmo) to ensure they can keep that growth going without getting overextended and failing to capitalize.

RKTs ability to recapture clients is one of the keys to their future success in my uneducated opinion. Their recapture rate is 4.6x the industry average. The Q3 earnings transcript includes a statement by the CEO on how when interest rates fall, retention rate falls, refinance activity is larger. The high recapture rate RKT has serves as a natural hedge to their retention of existing clients because their recapture is so much higher than average in the industry.

Quick aside - RKT announced a $1 billion share buyback program. They’ll be able to repurchase shares from time to time starting Nov10 2020, ending in two years. I don’t love the idea of share buybacks because I think this can be detrimental to actual business growth for the sake of shareholder value. However, with the large cash position RKT has (and it doubled from December 2019 to September 2020) I think this is a reasonable way to deploy some of that cash for now.

Ok so what about valuation using DCF, free cash flow analysis, something like that? Honestly I’m not convinced this is as useful as some people make it out to be. It’s nice to know what the numbers indicate, but I don’t spend a lot of time worrying about an exact price target based on anything like this. That said, you can crunch the numbers yourself or check out something like the Finbox resources:

[https://finbox.com/NYSE:RKT/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr](https://finbox.com/NYSE:RKT/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr)

**I don’t believe that fair value estimate for an instant**, but it's a part of the puzzle to consider. Finbox has various models you can check out, but it’s also just a nice place to view aggregate data other than directly from the SEC filings.

**Product Channels**

RKTs direct-to-consumer channel is their main source of revenue right now, but I think they will be successful in their efforts to grow their partner channels as well. Why do I say that? Numbers don’t lie:

* Direct-to-consumer Q3 growth: 131% YoY ($53.5B closed loan volume)
* Partner Network growth 127% YoY ($29.6B closed volume)
   * Adjusted Revenue for Partner Network is up 502% YTD vs 2019 ( see Q3 earnings transcript)

The partner network volume is a little over half of the direct-to-consumer volume but the growth rate is just so damn juicy. That revenue growth is hellathicc.

**Current Market and outlook**

Right now, rates are low. The average 30-yr mortgage fixed rate is 2.92% ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/mortgage-refinancing-surges-but-high-home-prices-stop-buyers.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/mortgage-refinancing-surges-but-high-home-prices-stop-buyers.html))

I cannot say how long interest rates will remain low but I believe RKT is positioned to continue to grow regardless of what rates do moving forward. They just cover so much of the space, and they do it with a focus on applied technology.

Here’s some blatant speculation. I think as we move into 2021 and the vaccine becomes more prevalent, millennials will buy, sell, and borrow against real estate with renewed intensity. I think RKT is uniquely positioned to capture that market.

You heard it here 1st. Redfin will be the #1 stock of 2021.

That's right, that shitty red website that your wife's bf keeps browsing while he hogs your shitty Wi-Fi (cause you can no longer afford the premium on decent internet service due to GME losses) is gonna be the gangbuster stock of 2021.

Why? As if you degenerates needed reasons but F it here we go.

1. The covid-so-work-from-home BS is going to unleash the biggest transformation in Real Estate ever seen in this country. As more people exit high priced SF, NY, Seattle, etc since their work no longer requires them to be physically there, many renters in those cities now find themselves in a position to be BUYERS in another city. That means a huge net gain of buyers as people from $3000/month RENT to $1600/month MORTAGE payment, most of them aged 25-35
2. Netflix, Tesla, Amazon should all have taught you this by now: the stocks that do well in the *medium* term are no longer the ones with the best financial metrics but the ones that are most popular among millenials and Gen Z. The ones people see on a daily basis and names get thrown around in Zoom meetings. Redfin is the Netflix of real estate due to its amazing website, customer engagement and disruptive fee schedule (who the F wants to pay 3.5% to sell their home when you can pay 1.5%? I sure don't)
3. Traffic to Redfin is skyrocketing. For those genius apes capable of interpreting a super simple graph here it is: [https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/redfin.com#section\_traffic](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/redfin.com#section_traffic) You get what means, retards? From 660 to 460s is a FKING huge jump at those levels. Now let's compare with their main ""competitor"" Zillow [https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/zillow.com#section\_traffic](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/zillow.com#section_traffic) See that? ZERO fking growth over the same period. Yeah Zillow site is ranked higher but that's cause boomers are still alive, the company is worth 5x more than RDFN and still has a lot of legacy crap. Do you want to invest in a company whose main growth comes from internet and sees their traffic growing ZERO over unprecedented stay at home months? I don't.
4. Valuation: can you believe the single biggest growth story of 2021 is ONLY priced at $8 billion right now?! Holy fuking shizzle, Batman! That's right. The website your wife keeps sending you home listings you can't afford after the GME losses is only worth $8 billion. That's like 2x Gamestops right now. Or 1/2 a Gamestop if you bought at $250 and still holding like a true retarded hero.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Sold a f ton of puts on  Jan 22 and used the proceeds those to buy 85, 90 and 120 calls expiring in Jan 22. Price target for 2021 is $400. Dead serious here. Or for you Papa Elon fans, $420 and funding secured.

Inb4 you all check my post history and bitch about all my WKHS posts, ya no fucking shit I’m gonna post about a stock I love. Inb4 Inb4 you tinfoil hat wearing GME/AMC fucks attack me, last time I checked there’s more than two stocks on the exchanges. Anyways here goes,

Workhorse group is a Loveland, Ohio EV manufacturer. 100% American Made (insert American Eagle boner gif) and completely electric for all you who value the environment or whatever. I’m sure you’ve all come across it at some point especially when I was the top trending stock for like a week at the end of June/July. As many of you might now, this shitshow of a government we have here in the good ol’ USA is looking to upgrade their self combusting USPS fleet via a NGDV (Next Generation Delivery Vehicle) bidding process for a contract to the tune of approximately 8 billion. When all is said and done, including maintenance and upkeep, the contract in the span of a decade or more is about 20b. This NGDV contract is the “betting” portion of this stock and despite what all the retarded naysayers claim, there is a fuck ton more to WKHS besides this contract. This is the cherry on top so I’m starting top down with this masterpiece. 

Currently, there are three remaining bids from companies involved in this NGDV selection process. Karsan (a Turkish company), Ford/Oshkosh (joint venture), and our beloved WKHS. 

Karsan - I can’t see this winning even a fraction of a percent of the contract due to it not being American. Not because it’s a bad company but if you check the requirements for the companies, they snuck in a clause that mandated 75% American made parts to be selected. Also, Biden, for the better part of his campaign and to this day has been proclaiming that he will be bringing American manufacturing to the forefront again and we will be buying American (something he and Trump miraculously had in common). For this reason, Karsan is seen as a non-factor. 

Ford/Oshkosh - The only realistic challenger to WKHS and only bear case being made against it. Undoubtedly, Ford is as American as it gets. But even more undoubtedly, they are shitty and unreliable as fuck. Millions of recalls on Ford vehicles in the past and present. Another big issue with this is that Biden was “zero-emission”. The prototype submitted for the proposal was a hybrid and not fully EV. For this reason, I think Ford receives a portion of this contract no greater than 25%. Another reason I think they’ll get only a minor stake in this is because their prototype does indeed actually fare better in rural routes where charging stations just aren’t all that practical or possible. 

The whole NGDV process has been going on for about 6 years and there’s no surprise that this inefficient government has been unable to wrap the process up at this point and then Covid took over. Yes there have been delays to the contract award as recently as October 2020. In a letter/memo addressed to the USPS Board of Governors, they were urged to not further delay this process as with the current degradation of the existing fleet, doing so would harm the project altogether and further complicate the process of removing these shitboxes that have been around since ‘87. With Covid being the last excuse to delay, and the vaccine now being rolled out, I DO NOT foresee another stalling of the process. 

Another reason WKHS is my favorite in this race is that DeJoy’s current philosophy on the USPS is to cut costs and to have the entity become for cost efficient. In case you haven’t noticed, ICE vehicles are much more costly to run and maintain that a 100% EV vehicle. Fewer parts means fewer problems and much less maintenance and repair costs. Also, in their recent financial statements, the USPS had requested a 600% increase in their infrastructure spending. I don’t see too many post offices crumbling to the ground, so this can only mean they’re gearing up to install a metric fuck ton of charging stations. By going fully EV, billions will be saved over time by the post office, an entity that’s currently burning cash like it’s their fucking job. 

THE LAST DELAY IN THE NGDV SLATES THE CONTRACT TO BE AWARDED FISCAL 2021 Q2 WHICH MEANS JANUARY-MARCH 2021. 

Enough about the contract though, let’s talk other aspects. WKHS is currently partnered with UPS in testing by out their fleet and also more importantly their drone delivery capabilities. WKHS currently owns the patents to vehicle borne drone launching technology. This isn’t talked about enough. Many people think the future of this company hinges on that shitshow of a contract when in reality the really exciting part is this drone tech. It would be extremely helpful and useful in efficient package delivery especially when there’s a whole fleet management system capabilities that the company offers. As the autonomous tech and drones sector begin to grow exponentially, WKHS has a head start on it (the commercial delivery aspect). 

Institutional holdings lies at almost 50%. The big boys and big girls (BAE Cathie Wood) are in on the company and they are in heavy. My wife Cathie must be seeing something in the future of this company if she’s grown her holding to over 2.2m shares and she’s not gonna throw some money into a gamble on a fucking government contract. 

Many claim that production is an issue but this is more a scare tactic than an actual issue. Sister company Lordstown Motors (Ticker: Ride) is led by former WKHS CEO. They have offered their factory, which has the capability to pump out about 600k vehicles a year, if WKHS needs it. Important to note that WKHS has a 10% stake in Lordstown and will receive royalties on the first 100k Endurance EV pickup trucks that Lordstown sells. So there’s another form of revenue the company has going for it. 

It’s a growth stock with a lot of potential and it’s logistically gearing up to grow. Received 200m financing from an institutional Investor during the late summer/early fall, and it entered into an agreement with Hitachi, to be assured in the logistics of the company. Hitachi is a pretty serious company to be partnered with unless you plan on slinging out vehicles. Most recently, a 6,320 truck order came in from Pritchard which totals around 250m give or take a few bucks. This is all while IKEA a company that aims to go fully electric by 2025 is testing out a fleet of WKHS C1000 vehicles. 

Connect the fucking dots and join the ride fellow autists. I’ve been long WKHS since January of 2020 and there’s plenty of room to run. High risk high reward with this growth stock but that’s why we’re all here right? 

Positions - 1000 shares, 11x $60c 2/12 (USPS BOG meeting Tuesday so these are scratch off lottos basically), 5x $60c 2/19 (see previous calls), 11x 45c 4/16. 

Let’s ride this horse to tendy town fellas 🤝

Edit: I’m a retard blah blah blah THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE I JUST LOVE THIS STOCK  blah blah blah

EDIT 2 - WKHS vehicles are being showcased at the super bowl as Pritchard is using WKHS trucks to take people to and from the super bowl and various surrounding locations. Essentially they are marketing themselves by providing shuttle services.

Edit 3 - WKHS is currently at about 30% short sold so a contract announcement in their favor will easily rocket this to 100+ as shorts scramble to cover. It sneaky made the list of highly shorted stocks.

Edit 4 - 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 (FOR THE VISUAL LEARNING RETARDS)

Edit 5 - TLDR: WKHS is 100% American made EV Last Mile Delivery Vehicle. Has Patents pending for its drone delivery tech. Frontrunner for USPS 8.2b+ Government Fleet Contract (NGDV Contract).

Edit 2: Someone let me know that I had made a clerical error, 99 billion should have been 9.9 billion

Hello, I have been a lurker of the sub for just over 2 years, this is my first DD so please don't hold back and let me know what my blind spots are.

AMC is currently trading at 6.83 when im writing this and I see it possibly going a little lower but I do believe that ~ 7$ is a good price for this stock considering the rebound it could make in the coming months/years.

AMC and theaters in general are a very important part of American culture, or at least have been for a long time, covid could change all of this I am aware; however I do not believe that hollywood is willing to give up a 9.9 Billion dollar a year industry because someone ate batman. In 2019 theaters generated an estimated revenue of 9.9B this number fell harshly and predictibly due to Covid laws, but their alternative was something no one even considered trying. Paying $30 to watch a movie via a streaming platform... This is something I think even idiots look at and think ""wow this is a rip"", and there is no alternative to this as movie studios simply cannot rely on subscription revenue to create a movie that can survive by todays standards.

One of the major things about theaters that draws people in is the sheer quality of the tech, where as we could spend 10 or 20 thousand on a tv and sound system, these theaters spend that per speaker, for an uncompromised experiance unobtainable at home without cutting edge and expensive technology that is by no means ""popular"" or ""accessible"".

My personal opinion is that AMC will probably climb past the 10$ mark when they can resume normal operation, me and all of my friends have been talking about theaters and how they are in a ""make-it-or-break-it"" scenario, this is probably my biggest worry in terms of this stock, there is a VERY real chance that people will simply not care about theaters after all this is over, but I am counting on Hollywood to not let that happen, I believe they would fight tooth, nail, and every apendage they had to keep theaters in America.

ACTUAL DD:

Old Financials: Prior to COVID-19, AMC had found itself in a small rut of sorts, their overall revenue was only up .19%, they were spending much more on advertisements than usual and they were also dealing with a lower than average operating income (down 48.68% 2018-2019) and they finished out the year in debt, they had lost 149.10M

New Financials: 2020 has been an absolute shit show for AMC, they are down across the board by > 90%, and their last reported operating income in september was -675.40M and the finished the year out 905.80M in the red. Q1 2020 obviously had lessened effects on the company as the US was undecided for a while on how seriously we were going to take it.
Their Gross profits have also fallen:
Q4 (2019): +939.60M - (+3.15%)
Q1 (2020): +616.40M - (-20.32%)
Q2 (2020): +14.20M - (-98.75%)
Q3 (2020): +84.10M - (-89.90%)
It is also worth mentioning their net income across the quarters has went from -149.10M in Q4 2019 to -3.64B Q3 2020

OPINION: I think that AMC is currently in a dangerous predicament in terms of hemmoraging money each quarter, however I do believe that Hollywood has enough of a vested interest to turn this into a possibly money maker. No one is calling for theaters to go away, people like them and they enjoy the atmosphere that comes with the experiance, we love the memes of a 20$ popcorn and a 50$ soda, but I really believe Americans like the cinema.

Position: 20 Jan 23 3.5$ call I belive in AMC long-term (at least for the next few years), I am very much so considering a LEAPs position on AMC, I wouldn't be mad being stuck with 100 shares of AMC, and considering the risk and reward, my breakeven is $8.50, I really believe that sometime between now and 2023 AMC will at LEAST go to 8.50, hopefully higher, but if lower than its DIAMOND HANDS INTO THE GROUND.

TLDR: AMC has issues and its a gamble, but goddamnit I like it

Recently they created their own streaming service (why not) and stock has responded nicely. $DISCA is up 95% in past 3 months. A portion of this is said to be due to short covering among funds (more on that later) but I disagree. GME squeeze has not picked up until mid January, Disca has been ripping since mid November.

It is the most shorted stock in SP500 and trades at a 50% valuation discount.
Discovery+ went live early January and earnings report is due March 1st, I expect even if they announce mediocre numbers, stock should pick up pace due to low valuation.

Some background:
In case you are as unaware as the cuck analysts on Wall Street apparently are, there is a nationwide gun and ammo shortage. Why do you care? The company Vista Outdoors (VSTO) is publicly traded on the NYSE. VSTO owns the ammo manufacturers Federal Ammunition, CCI, Blazer, Speer, American Eagle, and they just bought Remington’s ammunition plant after they went bankrupt. (imagine going bankrupt during the largest gun/ammo demand period in history, lmao). Besides ammo, they also make primers, brass, and other components. Primers are even harder to get than loaded ammo right now, because the manufacturers are using the primers to service their own needs first. The wide consensus across the industry is that things won’t return to “normal” (i.e. you can walk in a gun store or go online and buy ammo/primers at normal prices) for at least several years. VSTO owns the largest market share of American ammo manufacturing, followed by Winchester (Olin Corporation, OLN).


The fundamentals:
First and foremost, VSTO is a value investment. Some key metrics that make it a buy IMO (taken from ETrade data):

Price to sales: 0.86x (this means you are paying 86 cents for $1 of sales, that’s insane in a cyclical industry)
Price to book: 2.43x
Price to cash flow: 4.64x
And most importantly: Price to earnings. Now, the current number is 33.59x. This is including the quarter from a year/9 months ago where they barely turned a profit (Trump was still president, no coronavirus, no nationwide political unrest, etc).


Looking forward:
Forward P/E is difficult to estimate due to lack of analyst coverage, but if you look at the last two quarters and push forward only six months at the same/similar earnings (approx. $1 per share), you get a forward P/E of 13.5x!!
For the TA retards, if you look at historical charts, you will note that VSTO traded at $44-$50 throughout the tail end of the Obama presidency. Note that those prices were maintained when they were reporting EPS of approx.. 0.60 cents per share. Once Trump was elected and ammo demanded dropped off significantly, the stock price got hammered. (Again, they just reported two quarters in a row of over $1 per share in earnings.)


Ammo demand: according to shooting podcasts and other industry media I follow, Federal alone has over $1 BILLION worth of back orders right now. Other reports state that they currently have more outstanding orders than they got during the ENTIRE 8 year Obama presidency. Do the math for what that will look like once the market picks up on this.
Couple that with that fact that gun sales have been skyrocketing for the last year. New gun owners=more people buying ammo


Risks:
Biden administration passing/signing HR 127 into law, which introduces a shitload of retarded restrictions on ammo purchases by consumers. However, this will cause an even greater near-term spike in demand

Copper and lead prices continue to rise in relation to the inflated dollar (low risk, generally when suppliers raise prices the ammo manufacturers raise their prices too)

These are the reasons I think VSTO is the superior play on the ammo shortage- opposed to OLN, which is a much smaller market share, less profitable, and lower quality ammo in general, and P O W W, which I had never heard of until a week ago, and I still can’t figure out what brands of ammo they actually own (thats a big red flag)"|2021-02-08 10:36:58.317678|../output/raw/2021/02/08/DueDiligence_flair_DD_103659.csv|DueDiligence|['$VSTO', 'A']|[]|['I', 'I', 'USPSA', 'I', 'VSTO', 'I', 'I', 'NYSE', 'VSTO', 'CCI', 'VSTO', 'VSTO', 'IMO', 'E', 'E', 'TA', 'VSTO', 'EPS', 'I', 'LLION', 'NTIRE', 'HR', 'I', 'VSTO', 'OLN', 'P', 'O', 'W', 'W', 'I', 'I']|['CCI', 'HR', 'OLN']

Last time was right and got some juicy tendies. 

Short answer: it do go up

Long answer: Many reasons. Oil futures market is in backwardation. I know it’s a long word, but it just means that there is a short/medium term mispricing in the commodity market. Signaling a possible shortage in supply. 
Also, lockdowns are easing, I don’t have to explain to you what this means. 
Also, majority of shares took a beating after earnings report. It does not take a genius to know that stonks only go up. 

But which stock you say? 

RDS. I like it for the long term for various reasons, but it is one of the few oil stocks that has good news in the short term: it has just increased the dividend and made some cute acquisitions. Also, it’s much leaner after the post covid impairments.

$KO is one of those companies that were hit by the pandemic. As you may or may not know, their primary source of income is not the 15 bottles you swig every day, rather the franchise deals they make with restaurants, stadiums, $AMC, and so on, and in case you haven't noticed, these things have been shut down for a while, which means bad numbers.

However, with all the vaccinations going on, and Biden winning the presidency, soon Covid will be a thing of the past:

What this means is $KO will soon be swimming in money again. If you're quick you can get in before the smart money picks up on these obscure clues.

Now I'm not too good with numbers and stats (who needs it anyway, stonks go up), so instead, to show the potential $KO has let me direct you to the daily graph since 2020:

And the weekly graph since 2012:

Every time there's a big sell-off it's immediately followed by a buy-in, and since the sell-off just happened guess what's coming next?

What can I say? 🥤🥤🥤 Drink up those gains.

I am back today to share my DD on a company I have long loved but only recently started investing in. Posting this today so people can invest tomorrow if they want.  My timing is usually poor for posting my findings.

**RITE AID (RAD)**

Okay I know, robinhood is showing you it was .50 a year ago and you’re saying fuck idk about this one, it looks like I missed it.  It’s okay though, robbingyouhood is just lying again.  The truth is that rite aid had a 1:20 **reverse stock split** artificially X 20 the price.

*WHAT DOES THIS MEAN*

It means we can assume two things, rite aid has only doubled in price since its mediocre deal with Walgreens fell through.  They have trimmed the fat and beat earnings the last three quarters.

Rite aid is starting vaccinations on February 12th, along with other pharmacies.  I believe they will be seeing a significant increase in revenue.

*PROMISING NUMBERS*

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/RAD/financials/annual/balance-sheet

For those that can’t read, this tells us that rite aid is seeing close to **TWENTY FOUR** billion in revenue a year and is only being valued at a little over ONE billion at the current stock price.  They’re looking at over 6 billion in property and two billion in inventory.  

**WHAT DO I DO**

I am very bullish on Rite Aid, but I would also consider this a long term play.  I own 1000 shares and a bunch of calls spread out.  I expect a bump next week as vaccine/corona cycles back into the news.  

I also believe Rite Aid is undervalued.  It *should* be trading at 50$ right now.  It has potential to be trading at ~100.

And >50% of the 54million shares are held by institutions, with 20% being used to short.

20x 34.5 2/19 c is my immediate play

This post is just a quick reminder that the FINRA data has  some conditions:

If you read through the 05/2019 Information Notice ([https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019)) they state that the data:

""(1)  does not include any trades that are not publicly  disseminated, (2) is  not consolidated with exchange data, and (3) does  not—and is not  intended to—equate to short interest position  information. ""

In  general the short volume overstates the actual short position volume. A useful check are the  exchange short volume numbers from marketbeat for instance ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/)).

For example the total short sold volume as reported by the exchange ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/))   - \~61.8Mil -  for the week ending 1/15 does not match either the total   short volume reported by FINRA (for all exchanges) - \~84.5Mil- or even   just for NYSE - 24.7Mil.

Also, the Total Volume combined for all exchanges from FINRA for let's say the 22nd Jan (97Mil) is smaller than the one reported by the exchange \~195Mil which agrees with the Yahoo number.

For a Buy or Sell for  instance - there may be multiple trades behind the Buy that need to be  made to deliver or sell your shares - including maybe a short sale or  two. Now these shorts will be covered quickly, but they still show up in  the FINRA numbers - I think these complex trade chains are root of the  problem.

Like  always if I am wrong let me know and I can either take this down or  edit it appropriately. I just want us to be better informed."|2021-02-08 10:36:58.317678|../output/raw/2021/02/08/DueDiligence_flair_DD_103659.csv|DueDiligence|['GME', 'FINRA']|['GME']|['FINRA', 'FINRA', 'A', 'FINRA', 'NYSE', 'FINRA', 'FINRA', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']|[]

And that once the pent up demand for seeing movies in theaters is unleashed that AMC will be revitalized and soaring back to it's $30 share price from a few years ago. There is one big problem with that - AMC is already valued well above what it was leading up to the pandemic. 

For AMC to reverse course, soaring back to it's 2017 highs - a $3.27 billon market cap - that's really only about $9.41 a share based on todays number of shares outstanding. 2017 had also seen operating revenue soar from $3.2 billion to $5.0 billion (growth that it came nowhere near sustaining). The following 2 years had $5.4 billion in revenue along with increasing long term debt. 

[https://investor.amctheatres.com/financial-performance/financial-highlights/default.aspx#](https://investor.amctheatres.com/financial-performance/financial-highlights/default.aspx#)

Silver Lake converting $600 million of notes into equity was certainly a fortunate turn of events for AMC.  While this may take bankruptcy off the table,  there are still [debt problems](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/amc-entertainment-debt-soars-as-company-claims-to-have-staved-off-bankruptcy-62274670) remaining.  Long Term debt had already more than doubled between [2017 and 2019](https://investor.amctheatres.com/financial-performance/financial-highlights/default.aspx#) \- from $4.8 billion to $9.7 billion. 

I at one point bought into the AMC hype and that it would be heading for the moon - and for a moment it did. The reality is that if you bought in under $4 you've already done very well - and perhaps far better than you should have expected. 

Even AMC at $4.50 values the company about where it was January 2, 2018. Pre-pandemic, pre-Silver Lake loan and almost $5 billion less in long-term debt.  

Do you what you want.

I present to those reading this a few options plays for this week that I'm pretty confident are going to print. Rather than holding losses, these couple of plays will likely give consistent 50-100% profits. I edited out the no-no words and crude jokes after auto-mod keeps taking this down...whatever.

1. Chegg ($CHGG) puts.  

Chegg has been running up to an ATH ahead of earnings. As noted in my last post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldpc2n/chgg\_cheating\_chegg\_putsa\_decent\_opportunity/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldpc2n/chgg_cheating_chegg_putsa_decent_opportunity/)) , their guidance generally falls short. The stock is currently way overextended, and with the somewhat-near reopening of schools, there will be a damper on their growth projections. I'm predicting a pullback to $95 or so.  

Suggested options: 2/19 100/105 put debit spread (sell 2/19 $100P, buy 2/19 $105P), OR purchase the 2/19 $90P


2. Unity ($U) calls--SAFE TENDIES  

As you may have noticed, Unity (software developer, about 60-70% of mobile games use their tech) took a massive dive after earnings. Despite great profits and revenue, their slightly slower growth projections led to a massive overreaction, and it dumped 14% from $147 to $128 in a frenzy of selling that, importantly, had several spikes to $140. There is still positive buying pressure.  
Even aside from the fundamentals of the stock, guess who bought the dip? CATHIE WOODS. $ARKK acquired a nice 764,700 (!) shares on February 5th. Mama Woods is still confident in this stock. As should you--there was nothing so terribly wrong about their earnings that they deserved to dump to $128. Mobile games are still doing great, and their revenue will continue to be strong. This is a perfect dip buying opportunity, and the spikes back to $140 intermittently on Friday exemplify the buying strength. It WILL return to $140 soon unless the market as a whole dives.  

Positions: $U 2/19 $140C, 3/19 $150C.


3. Peloton ($PTON) calls--Trust The Woods  

Peloton was another company that had stellar profits, but dumped heavily on minor slowing growth projections. Revenue? Increased 128% to $1.06 billion. Subscriptions? Increased by several hundred percent each for their Connected Fitness as well as digital subscriptions. Your wife? Getting heftier each day, and mad that her $1900 bike order is getting delayed due to the massive flood of orders. Peloton has had to spend about $100 million to address these delays with expedited air shipping and the like. Aside, do NOT forget they also are acquiring Precor, giving them a solid footing in the post-Covid gym ecosystem.  
What happened to the stock? Again, like Unity, dumped solely because of minor dents in their projections. It also nicely recovered during the day (I managed to get in at $143, hehe)  
TL;DR? Peloton's bottom line is not affected significantly. Their growth is explosive, and continuing to rise. Cathie Woods again acquired another tasty 106,200 shares for ARKW. What does this mean? If she buys the dip, you need to buy the dip too.  

Suggested options: 2/19 $150C, 3/19 $165C


4. Twitter ($TWTR) puts.  

As in October...and July...and April...and February...and the October before that....Twitter earnings generally dump the stock at least 10%. Why did it do this every time? Slowing user growth, as well as uncertainty regarding ad revenue (they stopped running election ads) meant that the stock dove off a cliff every time. Now? People are (likely) leaving Twitter in droves. I had some info here about why, but I'm assuming that the auto mod keeps removing this post after I say the name of the former President, so I'm just going to leave it at that.  
Technical analysis? It's been running up to an ATH. The potential for it to dump right after earnings is INSANELY high--all it needs is a slight blemish on projections. And I'm pretty sure there will be many, many scars on their projections.  
On the flip side, their profits will likely be very good. Thing is, I simply do not see how banning the former President will help their bottom line and growth projections. Let me know what you think about this below.  

Suggested options: heck, why not 2/12 $50P for $93. You could do a longer date and higher strike, but honestly, either it dumps or it doesn't.


5. ArcelorMittal ($MT) Calls--steel gang isn't done yet  

The reasons for purchasing $MT and other steel stocks such as $VALE and $CLF have largely not changed. However, most of them have been sadly flatlining other than $X's brief rocket to $24 before pulling back...and then doing an offering.  
The normal reasons still apply--demand is high, supply is low, new infrastructure projects on the way, etc. This is pretty much just a gamble on earnings positively reflecting on the factors already in existence, and giving some momentum back to the stock. Plus, the calls are pretty cheap with relatively low IV, so it doesn't hurt to toss a little money at it. But to be clear, this is a much less assured play than the 3 I have already listed.  

Positions: $MT 2/19 $23C for $66. Could also just YOLO a 2/12 call on Wednesday at market close, should cost around $30 each


There are some other very major earnings coming up this week as well. Disney, GM, Uber/Lyft, Enphase. I might also do some weekly $DIS calls and ride the run-up to earnings, and then sell before earnings as positive Disney Plus news might already be priced in with their Investors' Day fireworks.

In any case, I might post some more DD on other things I find and research. Only slight annoyance is that barely any people see these types of posts amidst the ""har dar GME give me upvotes because I spent 30 seconds making this meme"""|2021-02-08 10:36:58.317678|../output/raw/2021/02/08/DueDiligence_flair_DD_103659.csv|DueDiligence|['DD']|[]|['I', 'I', 'ATH', 'P', 'OR', 'P', 'SAFE', 'NDIES', 'ATHIE', 'WOODS', '$ARKK', 'WILL', '$U', 'C', 'C', 'NOT', 'I', 'DR', 'ARKW', 'C', 'C', 'I', 'I', 'ATH', 'ANELY', 'I', 'P', '$MT', '$VALE', '$CLF', 'IV', 'I', '$MT', 'C', 'YOLO', 'GM', 'I', '$DIS', 'I', 'DD', 'I', 'GME', 'I']|['MT', 'VALE', 'CLF', 'MT', 'GM', 'DIS', 'GME']

\#Innovation#

The company has been recognized for innovation; for example it has developed technologies that allow mobile phone batteries to be made at room temperature rather than in expensive, heated dry rooms.

In 2010, BusinessWeek ranked BYD the eighth most innovative company in the world [\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Company#cite_note-businessweek-30) and that same year saw Fast Company ranking BYD as the 16th most innovative.[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Company#cite_note-fastcompany-31)

In 2017, PV Magazine has awarded BYD the top category of innovation on its newly launched battery storage system that advances progress in three categories: modularity, charging and discharging capacity, and efficiency.

TDLR: I think nobody talks about this company and feel price of stock will increase once more people start looking into other EV companies apart from the most popular ones.

If shorts settle T+2, and it’s only reporting shorts settled by 1/29, that would be trades executed 1/27 or before.  Missing any data from that Thursday fuckery by Robinhood etc and the following Friday with the all time high. 

Between 1/14-1/21 it traded in a very tight range 38.00-44.00 with good volume. Could that have been people covering their shorts. Is it possible the run up in price was actually just momentum off of the 1/22 trading day jump(which could of been caused by large shorts being covered and HFs booking losses). If you go back to that week and search for news regarding GME by each day. On 1/22 you see a giant spike in GMe articles, media talking about it, Jim Cramer tweeted out 1/22 that GME was a squeeze of a life time etc. this Reddit blew up etc. Will look for a large decrease in shorts to confirm that theory  but..

anyone who shorted the stock from 1/25-1/27 is going to add to the short interest number in the 1/29 report. Any shorts established between 1/25-1/27 made huge profits last week and could of been covered. Meaning the short interest data would show shorts that may actually not exist anymore. 

Because the market is reacting 100x faster to GME moves than it was prior to the 1/15 data is SI data becoming less powerful as a predictor?

They look like your portfolio before you discovered WSB. Like anything that needs to be extracted from the ground (oil 🛢, gold 🏆, etc), falling prices often mean permanent production shutdowns. But it’s time for that to turn around. [Excerpt](https://www.barrons.com/articles/covid-19-has-slammed-the-energy-sector-heres-a-hot-commodity-that-could-keep-rising-51589536800):

*Going into 2020, global nuclear utilities were expected to require roughly 182 million pounds of uranium concentrate to run reactors for the year, while expected global mine production was seen at 142 million pounds, he says. The pandemic has affected 50% of global uranium mine supply, or over six million pounds a month, so even a three-month loss would push production down to just over 120 million pounds this year, he says.*

Uranium isn’t like oil, you can’t buy significant amounts on the open market - reactor operators often have significant supply contracted out for decades. We’re at the point in the uranium cycle where reactor operators are beginning to open new contracts for supply into the next decade. And the best part is that price runs on uranium can be extremely violent, see [this chart](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/uranium) from the last time uranium went to the 🌕 from 2003-2007. Prices spiked from $25/lb to a peak of $140/lb. Excerpt from $CCJ filings:

*Uranium rallied 30% from March lows. Price upswings are normally violent and self-reinforcing because: ""History demonstrates that in general, when prices are rising and high, uranium is perceived as scarce, and a lot of contracting activity takes place. The heavy contracting that takes place during price runs, drives investment in higher-cost sources of production.""*

So much production was shut down in 2020 due to COVID that many producers have had to buy uranium on the spot market. As demand continues to outstrip supply, we might see a uranium bull cycle even crazier than that of the 2007 bull run.

What are the best tickers to express a long uranium bet? If you’re subscribed to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/), you could buy $URNM like a fucking loser. But why would we do that? I've lost money on $JNUG, I know not to play with small junior miners.

Call me a boomer but I prefer big established companies like **Cameco (ticker $CCJ)**. It’s been around for decades, and has lasted through multiple downturns. It has a market cap of $5B and even pays out a small dividend! We’re not fucking dividend investors though. My point is that Cameco is responsible for nearly 10% of global uranium production so **it’s not going anywhere**. Contracts to receive uranium with them are comprised of 40% fixed price and 60% spot - meaning that if prices of uranium on the open market moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀, you’ll see the same for their revenues.

Since no one knows when the SQUEEZE is going to happen, I suggest you buy shares or LEAP calls. Don’t gamble what you’re not willing to lose. That’s why I recommend somewhat OTM LEAP calls because of the long-term nature of this play.

But there’s some geopolitics behind this. 

There’s talk that Taiwan is essentially putting all cards on the table and push the issue of independence at all costs in a do or die effort. Essentially, Taiwan wants to pressure America into announcing full on Taiwanese independence and committing to it. This would be the culmination of the modern Taiwan issue, and essentially would be the end of the 2 Chinas status quo. 

This is basically a gamble by the Taiwanese hawks (DPP) who are willing to sacrifice their reputation and market share of TSMC in order to force support.

How? 

By forcing an artificial shortage of chips. This not only leads to shortage of automobile chips for Chinese companies, but also incentivizes America to give full support. Btw, EU feels betrayed on this especially since they supported a Taiwanese petition to block lithiogram machines. 

The reason Taiwan is playing chicken is because they feel there is a limited opportunity to force American commitment before China grows too powerful. Likewise, US hawks also want to force a confrontation since it’s “now or never” before China reaches peer state status.

TLDR:

- Taiwan is planning an artificial shortage of chips especially for the auto sector to pressure US into independent support.

- Geopoltics is prioritized over business practices, since market share could be lost and business relations strained as EU/China/Us companies feel alienated and untrusting.

- DPP is using TSMC/Qualcomm for geopoltics in a last ditch effort to force Biden admin on the China issue

Fine, although its had multiple pullbacks and setbacks throughout the year I  believe NVDA earnings seems to be the catalyst where the big big explosion occurs throughout the whole sector. However, its going to be a slow rally till then. I encourage WSB to get in before its too late and you're questioning why all the autists decided to write their AMD DD after it jumped 10% !

I'm not a financial advisor, I just been like the stock, along with CRSR and i think the gaming industry is going to have a massive incoming cycle so its best to get on the rocket early. The market diversification has gotten a little sloppy with everything going with shorts, so AMD is just too underbought in reality, which leads to one usual explanation. **THE BOOMERS HAVE NOT BOUGHT IN AS MUCH AS THEY COULD YET**. Social media trading is only increasing and all it takes is one shift into seeing AMDs retard real life strength with their products and services and poof we'll be swimming in mint. I usually would say AMD is just an **options** play for me, but I actually recommend grabbing shares now as this is probably the highest floor you'll ever see a stock have. It would be dope to do more of these and hope this helps the culture moving forward... ya boy got the 9-5 tomorrow but dreams come first couldn't put enough rockets so comment them in for me so they can reach me in my slumber all the way in VALHALLA

Also purchased $SRE and $EIX. 

**Summary**:

California utilities are undervalued ($SRE, $EIX, $PCG) and still down \~ 27% from pre-Covid levels.  I believe all are strong buys – I have positions across the board. $PCG is my most bullish. I believe it is a very cheap entry point for a company that has proven to be bulletproof to regulators/oversight.

PGE Emerged from Bankruptcy with $25.5 B settlement

PGE should be eligible to reinstate dividend in 2022. Cheap entry into a growth stock with an expected reissuance of dividend.

Wild fire risks are low in winter, spring and early summer. 2020 was actually a very intense fire season but CA utilities mostly came out unscathed due to public safety power shutoffs (PSPS).  

1) **CA Utilities Undervalued**  
 The real BRRRR are utilities. They print their own money by capital improvement deprecation based on rate cases. Due to the 2018 wildfires and subsequent PSPS, utilities are getting authorized by California and Federal regulators to do more capitalized projects than ever. What does this mean? Revenues are going to be higher than ever. In the case of PCG, they hit the sweet spot in ineffectiveness. Doing so bad not to go bankrupt, but bad enough to get all their projects authorized by the state to maximize revenue.   Again, the California Public Utility Commission authorized the highest general rate case ever. 

2) **Bankruptcy Settlement**  
 $PCG’s market cap is $23.54B and has an outstanding bankruptcy $25.5 B settlement as of June 2020. Why is this significant? For one, the optics of having a valuation larger than your settlement liability flip (due to a $5.4 billion and partial $1.35B obligation) with February 25th earnings (unless the stock goes down by 20%) but more importantly, the settlement was incredibly favorable to $PCG.  

$PCG will likely post their highest annual revenue ever. EVER—see item #1. This wouldn’t work in the real world (maybe banking in 2008), but in the California utility world, if you screw up you get more money. Fire happened 2018, 2017 $PCG had $17.14B in revenue. 2020 revenue might be as high as $18.71B. So likely 10% higher revenues two years after a colossal failure.  

This is why utilities are included in the Monopoly game. 

3) **Dividend and Leadership**  
 $PCG agreed to freeze their dividend until $6.2B in non-GAPP core earnings. This target can be met as soon as 2022—not much of a penalty all things considered especially with the cheap entry point for this stock (down 36% from pre-COVID, down 52% from post fire peak) 

Another settlement term was restructuring the entire leadership team. $PCG did that, and it’s not like they’re replacing Jason Garrett with Mike McCarthy. They got themselves someone with a proven record leading utilities in Patricia Pope, who signed a 5-year deal with PG&E starting January 4, 2021. She previously served as CEO for Consumer’s Energy which was known for safety. She’s also the first women to ever lead two Fortune 500 companies. This will be her first earnings call for PG&E. Her announcement caused a brief spike in the stock—I expect the same with her first earning call (particularly with the positive numbers). 

4) **Wildfires**  
 Why buy now? Wildfire season is officially over now that CA received a ton of rain. This should be reflected in the risk for all utilities, but hasn’t resolved yet. 2020 was a very long fire season that lasted deep into January 2021. With all the PSPS and redflag warnings, I was hesitant to pull the trigger until CA was in the clear. I also positioned my call options to align w/ the beginning of 2021 fire season for a higher ROI if my strike price comes in. So in the clear for wildfires + new CEO + high earnings—great entry point.

**Potential** **obstacles**

There are pending investigations into some 2020 wildfires. Regardless of culpability, a big chunk of this will be covered by wildfire safety fund and won’t be anywhere near the 2017/2018 fires.

Operation and Maintenance costs/regulatory fines. Most costs are not capitalized, but most utilities know how to work around the regulators to get everything capitalized. There’s always the potential for additional fines, but they’d be pretty inconsequential.

Biggest obstacle: Everyone hates PG&E—like hate hates them. But WSB seems to be cool with Martin Shkreli so there’s that.

**MOAT –**   
 Ultimate Moat. They are bulletproof and there’s no point of entry other than acquisition. They provide infrastructure to transport power. Battery storage, solar, wind, gas, nuke, etc. all still use the same grid to transport. With higher EV demands and increase investment in fire hardening measures revenues will continue to climb.

**WHY WSB?**

Get that Money! Buy the utility you hate. If you’re in PG&E territory, buy the utility you hate and are obligated to pay."|2021-02-08 10:36:58.317678|../output/raw/2021/02/08/DueDiligence_flair_DD_103659.csv|DueDiligence|['$PCG']|['PCG']|['I', '$PCG', '$SRE', '$EIX', '$SRE', '$EIX', 'I', 'I', '$PCG', 'I', 'PGE', 'B', 'PGE', 'CA', 'CA', 'BRRRR', 'PSPS', 'PCG', 'B', 'B', 'B', '$PCG', '$PCG', '$PCG', 'B', 'B', '$PCG', 'B', 'GAPP', 'COVID', '$PCG', 'E', 'CEO', 'E', 'I', 'CA', 'PSPS', 'I', 'CA', 'I', 'ROI', 'CEO', 'WSB', 'MOAT', 'EV', 'WHY', 'WSB', 'E']|['PCG', 'SRE', 'EIX', 'SRE', 'EIX', 'PCG', 'PCG', 'PCG', 'PCG', 'PCG', 'PCG', 'PCG']

Gamestop was heavily shorted last year as hedge funds though it was a dying company.  

However in September Ryan Cohen who is the largest individual hold of Apple stock and founder of hugely profitable digital per food company Chewy started buy huge chunks of GME stock and indicating he was going to turn the company from brick and mortar retailer to a profitable online gaming juggernaut.

Also Michael Burry of The Big Short fame sent a letter to the GME board 
https://www.marketfolly.com/2019/08/dr-michael-burry-long-gamestop-sends.html

Once WSB got hold of this we saw the huge inflows of retail traders which pushed the price to $480 before buying was restricted culling the potential short squeeze.

Now Gamestop's price to sales ratio (P/S Ration) is currently less than 1. https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/price-sales
(Market Cap $4.4BN /Annual revenue ~$7BN).

This seems fine for a dying brick and mortar but if the company becomes profitable (likely in next earning report in March) and starts to transform into a tech digital platform for gaming (likely as e AWS exec hired as CTO) it's P/S ratio will start rising to match other tech companies.

Square (SQ) for example has a P/S ratio of 14+ https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SQ/square/price-sales.

If GME had a similar P/S ratio (after the above happens) the share price would be well above $1000 per share.

Also remember the market is forward looking so if it seems signs of profitability and transformation then it will head to that valuation well before the process is complete.

There are many specially tuned light type arrays and intervals, which effect everything from livestock behavior/growth speed and the color/taste of produce.

There's a major growth opportunity with this tech, coupled with emerging environmental and sociopolitical climates, such as:

* Climate change is shifting the tropical rain belts in the Eastern hemisphere (Europe/Asia) more northern per the recent [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00963-x): where there's less sunlight on average, forcing LED adoption to offset crop loss from shorter days, particularly in subarctic regions.
* Climate instability: with flooding, drought, etc. climate patterns becoming harder to predict, both livestock and plant growth need moderately reliable patterning to accurately meet future agricultural output goals and projections.
* There's a growing demand for stable food security and production across Asia, as a matter of national security, especially in the wake of pandemic food supply chain disruptions.

Plants and livestock both benefit from specifically tuned LED color combos, which effect growth speeds, enhanced flavors, etc. and where a few companies are now innovating.

Additionally as user **PhotoMacro1** states:

>PhD in plant science here. Another big source of revenue will be using Red and Blue LED light post harvest. Even in grocery stores.

This snippet from the Everlight Electronics [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everlight_Electronics) is pretty good TLDR of the space:

>In 2019, Everlight's newly formed optoelectronic R&D team introduced tunable LEDs to maximize animal husbandry and aquaculture.  
>  
>For instance in poultry farming, exposing a chicken to white light takes 172 days to reach reproductive maturity, while exposing to red light reduces to 168 days, but blue light increases maturity to 182 days. Green light exposure makes poultry gain weight faster, due to growth hormone receptor stimulation and enhancement of satellite glial cells which promote muscle development.  
>  
>The R&D team also introduced UV LEDs for eggshell surface sanitization and water disinfection for waste water runoff. In collaboration with Dr. Kun-Hsien Tsai, Professor at College of Public Health at National Taiwan University, a novel ovitrap was introduced which pulses Ultraviolet C to regularly destroy collected mosquito eggs.  
>  
>In 2020, Everlight collaborated with Professor Wang Yong-song’s team of the Institute of Fisheries Science, National Taiwan University to develop a special LED lamp for grouper fish aquaculture, where specific wavelength exposure reduces cannibalization and loss of fingerlings by over 40%.  
>  
>In 2021, Everlight released new horticultural LEDs in spectrums tailored to augment the red pigment of strawberries. Strawberries rely on sunlight to produce their red color through a process called anthocyanin biosynthesis, but in areas with little sunlight horticultural LEDs can be used to catalyze this biochemical process instead.

I think Teradata (TDC) has 5x immediate upside. I could post some more in-depth DD, but I 'm trying to get this idea posted before market open so anyone who wants to can get in before the massive ripper. I think the following cuts to the chase

I was lucky enough to pitch this shitco to an investment club in college back in 2014. At the time, TDC was being disrupted by Hadoop/the cloud and all signs pointed to the slow death of this legacy data warehousing business. My idea was basically laughed off the floor and the club didn't buy, and honestly I couldn't blame them in hindsight. I followed this business for the next 7 years and saw it ripped 30% last week, and is now up 11% in premarket.

Apparently, TDC has managed to launch a cloud-based data warehousing alternative to Snowflake. This business segment just achieved $100 million in annual recurring cloud-based revenues, with yoy growth of 100%+. This compares to Snowflakes \~$400 million, which is also growing at triple digits. I would say that TDC is a pretty serious competitive threat to SNOW at this size. 

SNOW is valued at 175x sales (\~90 billion market cap), and TDC is valued at 1.6x sales ($3 billion market cap). If you were to slap a 170x revenue multiple on TDC's emerging cloud business, it would be worth $17 billion, up from $3 billion this morning.

TDC has about 20% short interest just received a buy rating from BofA. The squeeze has already started and the stock is up  37% on the week, but I believe we are in the early innings of a 500% ripper. Major sellside analysts are starting to upgrade the stock. 

Unlike GME, which is a dinosaur facing two asteroids (death of the mall, death of physical game discs) TDC is a recovering shitco with an extremely attractive cloud business that is going to compete directly with SNOW. There are some very attractive quality underpinnings to this trade - i.e. this isn't a pump and dump, it's a classic turnaround that could rip past $100 this month.  

I'm buying weeklies on open, see you fellas on the moon

On 2/5/2021 Ubiquiti announced another quarter that exceeded expectations with strong global demand for their products. The growth/adoption of their products into the enterprise demonstrate that the company continues to gain traction against the likes of Cisco (CSCO).

For those that read a headline and act: A couple of items to be aware of.

1. While the stock has a 20.8B market cap, it only trades a little over 100k shares a day or about 1.5% of the available float. This means using limit orders when buying or selling might be best. Otherwise the MM’s will take advantage of you.
2. The liquidity/spreads in the option market are horrible. Outright buying the stock is likely the way to play this stock

**A Little Background**

Ubiquiti was founded by Robert Pera and went public in 2011. This is the same Robert Pera that owns the Memphis Grizzlies. I like to think of him in the same light as Mark Cuban. He is a disruptor by nature and has an anti-establishment approach. He is not always conventional in his methods when engaging with the media and public which likely results in less overall hype around Ubiquiti.

As of 12/31/2020 there were 62.8m shares outstanding. Founder Robert Pera owns 56.2m shares or 89.6% of the company.

The company has been aggressively buying back shares, reducing the shares outstanding by over 2m in 2020. As of 12/31/20 they still had $385.2m authorized under the “2020 May Program” which facilitates the company’s repurchase program.

According to [Fintel.io](https://fintel.io/), institutions own 6.9m shares, resulting in over 100% ownership between Pera and institutions. Some percentage of these institutions represent index funds that are not actively managed. The institutional ownership may be overstated as a result of stale data and/or the company’s repurchase of 309,133 shares in the last 3 months of 2020.

Then there are the retail investors that own some small slice of this company. Some of the retail investors are self-declared Ubiquiti “Fan Boys” such as myself that have owned the stock for years and have deployed their equipment in our homes and across the enterprise’s where we work.

The end result is a float of 6.5m shares of which some percentage that is owned by index funds or owned by “Fan Boys” and not actively traded.

The company just declared another $0.40 dividend. With $1.60 in anticipated dividends over the next 12 months, Pera will be taking home an estimated $90m per year in dividends. Why is this relevant? Pera is is able to generate cash from his Ubiquiti ownership, without the need of selling shares. He just holds his current shares while increasing his ownership percentage through the company’s stock repurchase program.

**Now for the Shorts**

As of 1/15/21 there were 1.04m shares short which represents 15.94% of the float. We will have to see how these change when the 1/31 numbers are released this week. The low daily average volume results in a Short ratio of 10.38 as calculated by Yahoo finance as of 1/15.

With a great quarter behind them, a growing business, fewer COVID-19 related supply chain risks and combined with insiders who generally do not sell, where will the shorts get shares to cover their bets if the stock continues to move against them?

Pera has not shown a desire to sell.Mid-Cap index funds are not actively managed.“Fan Boys” are not selling anytime soon.The Company continues to repurchase shares.

I believe short covering could result in a monumental short squeeze if the stocks momentum continues an upward trajectory.

**Why not a leveraged Buy-out**

Now I am certainly not an expert on leveraged buy-out’s, but what would it take for Pera to decide to take the whole thing private. Like Michael Dell taking his namesake company private in 2013 before going public again in 2018.

The company is generating great cash flow, actively reducing the number of shares available and is predominantly owned by a multi-billionaire.

With $385.2m still available to repurchase shares, at a current market price of $330, this could remove another 1.16m shares from the float, making it that much easier to buy-out the company.

Is the stock repurchase program a precursor to something bigger?

**Conclusion**

You could conclude this continues to be a growth story of a company looking to disrupt the status quo. They are profitable, growing, pay a dividend and demonstrated good cash flow all the while repurchasing their stock.

This could be a massive, short squeeze in the making as the short ratio is 10.38 and float continues to be reduced as a result of the share repurchase program.

The endgame could be a leveraged buy-out that sees Ubiquiti taken private resulting in a handsome reward for Pera’s loyal followers.

I Love Ubiquiti’s products and this stock.

I have been long since 5/22/2014 and have added to my position as recently as 2/5/21

Edit1: Clarification based on a comment. Leveraged Buyout may be the incorrect term for my thought process. I intended to imply that Pera could just take the company private as he owns a significant percentage of the outstanding shares and is reducing the percentage he does not own through the stock repurchase program.

Since the GME hype has calmed down a bit, I present you with my first DD on this forum.

First of all, no financial analyst here. This is no investment advice and do your own research.

I will take you trough each step in my DD. Sorry for the long post, but I want to have a discussion with you on my DD, possible flaws in my research etc. Therefore, I will post everything I do.

**Okay here we go:**

I have a background in economics. Since the market nowadays is quite high, I am trying to analyze every investment I make thoroughly to minimize the risks. After November last year it was quite easy to make a return on investment. However, we have increased a lot and I feel the urge to deep dive in every company I invest in.

**Step 0, find an interesting company to analyze.**

What my ritual is, is to analyze the list of next week’s earnings. I analyze every company on the list, think about possible market conditions which have changed in favor or disfavor for the company, read news articles, and look at the earnings.

While doing this, me and my team have picked Enphase Energy.

**Step 1, look at the previous realized EPS and Revenue vs. forecasted EPS and Revenue:**

  The WSB I subbed to is not the same as the WSB today, so for the newbies: GME NOK BB 🚀 💎 🚀. For everyone else:
  
  Within the global economy, there are several emerging markets. Asia, Africa, and Latin America have experienced and are on the cusp of unprecedented growth. Pretty much every industry is booming, but not every industry is easy to invest in. 
  
  The three fastest growing industries within these countries (mainly Brazil, North/ South Africa, SE Asia) are consumer products, infrastructure and development, and financial infrastructure. Consumer goods and development are extremely segmented industries; it would be almost impossible to dependably buy stocks that cover a large market share. However, due to corruption and ease of communication with foreign entities, the banking industries within these countries are fairly centralized. 
  
  The banks I have mainly been looking at are BDORY (Brazil), SGBLY (South Africa), IBN (India), among others. Most of these banks haven’t fully recovered from the initial coronavirus drop so if you’re like me, and think pretty much every US stock is overpriced, this could be the play for you. For consumer products, my play is Coca-Cola. These are long term plays so don’t expect 30% in two days. Of course, invest at your own risk.

General: 
During a recession energy consumption always decreases relatively, and even more so with Covid, due to lack of office spaces, lack of recreation, and lack of travel / commute. You can look back at the ‘08 ‘09 crisis and view how energy and c02 emissions skyrocketed after Michael Burry got famous. [1]
   
  

Next, we have the catalysts, Joe Biden. According to his administration there are only 9 years left to stop the worst consequences of climate change. Biden will act quickly, and aggressively. He’s working with Congress to enact in 2021 legislation and plans that will put America on an irreversible path to economy wide net zero emissions. While also rallying the rest of the world to pursue clean action through leadership and action. Not really lastly, but also make $400bn as ONE part of a broad mobilization of public investment in clean energy and innovation (relatively old news, but relevant) All while creating 10,000,000 new jobs in clean energy. This is within his “Biden will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment” which also pertains to the auto industry such as EV gov vehicles, see WKHS as an example.[2][3]  
    

Energy has already gone up alot this last 6 months. It's too late! False. So has everything, even giants like Apple are up over 100% since March lows.   Clean energy has been supressed these last 4 years, and are only going back to where they belong.
  

Hydrogen: 
Recently Mercedes-Benz spins off it’s truck unit due to ever changing landscape in industrial and commercial vehicles. While premium sedans have largely been adopting the EV mantra, commercial trucking has seemed to go the way of hydrogen. “..while the truck business is investing in hydrogen fuel cell technology. [6] Recently Ballad power Systems $BLDP signed a deal to make the hydrogen fuel cell for hydrogen power boats as well. [7]

  

Nuclear::
Now, we have Solar, Wind, Hydrogen and what else? Well, reasonably speaking you also have Uranium to Nuclear energy. Did you know that The world has largely put most of their uranium mines on hold and in maintenance mode? Right now there are 442 Nuclear Reactors operating within 30 countries, primarily in US, France, China, Russia and Japan (rip) this consume 200 MILLION pounds in Uranium per year. We are currently sitting at a 20 million pound deficit and could reach as high as 50 million pounds.     
  

Utilities have been underbuying Uranium since 2014 than they need to produce nuclear energy, the difference (or deficit) between what they are buying and what they need to produce Nuclear energy has been filled by drawdown of existing inventories. We also have Elon Musk talking about Nuclear Bull case https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKH-uVqg9OI [4][5]
  



# If I had to choose a single ticker from each, I would choose **$FCEL** for Hydrogen, **$NXE** for Nuclear, **$ENPH** for solar

The tides in energy have changed, we are seeing huge pushes globally to adopt these new technologies. If you rub your couple of brain cells together really hard, this shit is the future.    

Tickers: $FCEL, $BLDP, $PLUG, $NXE, $ENPH or if you want ETFs, $TAN, $FAN, $PBW (shout out to $ICLN gang) 
  
Final: This was way longer and harder than I anticipated to put together. We still have Energy Storage, Wind, and I didn’t even address Solar reasons, Biofuels or NatGas. But these are my big bets for 2021. I'm aware EV is beast, but so is everyone else, bringing new information to light that may be less represented. 
I'll do a part2: if you enjoy this expanding and adding extra details.

The size of the move depends mainly on two things:

\- The market cap of the company: for a huge company like JNJ, any event will generate only a tiny move, whereas the value of a penny stock can +10x after a successful event.

\- Size of the addressable market: does the drug treat a rare disease or a common one? The larger the size of the market, the larger the move would be.

Drug approvals are a long process that can take years, but in some instances, the FDA grants priority date to certain drugs. These are referred to as PDUFA events.

Here's a list of the ones (with market cap > 1 billion to avoid my post being removed) coming up this month:

I have added what the drug does (from a quick google search) + addressable market size (basically just my intuition, without any data to support):

* 11 Feb 21 [$REGN](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/REGN) Evinacumab (high cholesterol), addressable market: small
* 15 Feb 21 [$GTHX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/GTHX) Trilaciclib (designed to improve outcomes of patients who receive chemotherapy), addressable market: large
* 25 Feb 21 [$SRPT](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SRPT) Casimersen (Duchenne muscular dystrophy), addressable market: small

* 28 Feb 21 [$ATNX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ATNX) Oral Paclitaxel (metastatic breast cancer), addressable market: medium

My positions:

I have invested some money only in SRPT and ATNX. In SRPT, because it had a huge drop recently and I hope an approval will trigger a recovery. ATNX because I think the treatment being in the form of a pill is a winner. I haven't researched the rest.

Somehow, against all odds, a large number of you autistic fucks have made some life changing gains on GME. This post is in no way encouraging you to sell your positions or even open new ones. Thats because I'm not a fiduciary advisor and know fuck all about what you should or shouldn't do. All I will say is welcome to all the new members out there and if there's one piece of advice I can give you, its to trust your gut.



Now lets get into it. This post is my DD that I wanted to share on $VIRT, not because I am recommending you to do anything, but because I enjoy researching shit because its fun and I figured this would help organize my thoughts. 



So lets get into it. I'm sure most of you have noticed the new exposure this sub has been getting on a worldwide scale. If you've been here even since Dec. in 2020, you'd notice this sub has even gained over 6M subscribers in the last month. I'm not going to tell you I've been around since the start, I've just been lurking and a post or comment every once and a while since I started following a few years ago. The sub count really means fuck all to be honest, the real numbers that are important here are the #'s of new retail traders joining the markets while bringing in new money by doing so. Give this Reuters article a quick read (promise it will only take 5 minutes, 10 if you're a true retard): https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-numbers-idUSKBN29Y2PW




For those who are lazy fucks who don't want to open the article: with no fee trading, retail traders have flooded the market. To what extent you may ask, and why the fuck does this matter? Well back in Jan 2020, before the March crash, retail made up ~17% of trades on the market. By July/August, this shot up to 25%. Some analyst in this article noted their prediction for 2021 is 30%+ of volume will be made up of retail. **THE TREND IS INCREASING** for those of you who couldn't pass your 2nd grade math class. So why did i even mention GME to start? Well according to an analyst from Piper Sandler, this past Wednesday set a new record for volume traded for US cash equities of **24.5 Billion** . Thats volume traded, not a $ amount. Options volume also hit a record high in volume at 57.1 Million. For both stocks and options, this supposedly is double the record in volume traded in a single day from 2020, or triple in 2019. One last important #, its estimated amongst the top 6 brokers, there are 100 Million+ retail traders. **100 Million** thats a fuck ton of regular Joes' and retards joining the game gambling away their $600 stimulus checks. 



TLDR: Retail trading #s are going the fuck up, and fast. This in turn mean a fuck ton more volume traded on the market.



OK Cool. Why does this matter? Well aside from Melvin Securities (Melvin Capitals Market Maker/scum of the earth), there are other Market Makers that do the same thing (provide liquidity to brokers allowing autists like us to buy and sell stocks and options). Companies like $VIRT, Virtu Financial, that are publicly traded. Lets take a look at the breakdown of trading volume across market makers, Brokers, Liquidity providers etc:


https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BjrX0/1/



$VIRT has showed a consistent increase in trading revenue and EPS since their IPO in 2015. This growth is due to various synergies on their platform from previous buyouts, volume spikes (due to volatility) and you guessed it, an increased amount of retail trading. According to their 2019 full year report, they supported approximately ~30% of all retail trading. This is up from 25% the previous year. 
https://s21.q4cdn.com/422114427/files/doc_financials/2019/ar/Virtu_2019_AnnualReport_Final.pdf



Ok so why does all this matter, if this trend in increased retail trading continues, that means more trading income for $VIRT. And turn, higher earnings. Why? This is because those Ask/Bid spreads you see when buying/selling are typically provided through market makers. They make money off of these spreads. 1 cent here or there, maybe a little more for wider spreads times **millions** of trades/day equals out to big money for them. An even bigger wet dream would be if Melvin Securities went under and that portion of the market making sector being open for the taking. Then again, that probably won't happen but regardless **Fuck Melvin**.



So what else? $VIRT has provided a $0.24 dividend for **22 consecutive quarters** and also announced $100 million in buy backs on their Q3 report released in Nov 2020, also making a statement to ""meaningfully enhance shareholder returns"" with additional buybacks and dividends moving forward. And a shout out to the true gambling addicts who love earnings plays, $VIRT has earnings coming up on **Feb 11th**. Thats this Thursday. Lets even take a look at their revenue growth. According to their 2019 full year report, Virtu took in $1.5B in revenues. Fast forward to the first 3 quarters of 2020, that totals over $2.5B and we still even haven't seen Q4 results yet. While yes, the volume in March/April played a part in this, Q3 revenues were still over $650M, which is still over a third of the full 2019 year. Their current market cap is only ~**$5.4B** with a PE of **6.6**. Talk about nice returns. Time to bet on the Casino instead sitting down at the fucking roulette table. 



TLDR: More retail trading = more $$ for market makers like $VIRT

THIS IS NOT STOCK ADVICE, JUST EDUCATIONAL/ENTERTAINMENT (maybe lol) AND MY OWN THOUGHTS ABOUT WHY I LIKE THIS STOCK.  

SGMO TLDR 

1. Low risk verus very high potential reward (The chance of any major setback obliterating stock price is super low for multiple reasons better explained below and many opportunities and paths for giant gains.

2. Growing patent cataloge in a new rapidily growing feild of genetic treatments and cures. (This adds both locked in value irrelevant of any company success and akes them a more desirable aquisition target from a giant pharma brand)

3. You like CRSP this is CRISPR 2.0. At most few research cycles behind crspr success seems inevitable and despite being years behind crspr it could catch up soon based on technology and computing leaps and the experience gained from successful CSPR treatments and trials.

4. CRSP comparison even if you disagree places focus on this company from people With crspr FoMO.

5. ANY significant advance on any of the multiple severe conditions/diseases they are working on that alone could cause a doubling or more of the low stock price

6. Very juicy looking target for acquisition by a larger pharmaceutical company looking to get into gene editing with a relatively/currently cheap acquisition (the reasons it’s a good stock are exact reason why it’s a good acquisition for a giant pharma brand)

I meant to post this on the weekend but shit happens lol.

**What is CLNE?**

Since this is pretty googleable information, I'll keept it short. CLNE provides natural gas solutions for transportation throughout the US and Canada. They started out with compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified natural gas (LNG), which are both good, but more importantly now have renewable natural gas (RNG). They sell RNG under the name Redeem and you can read all about it [here](https://redeem.cleanenergyfuels.com/) The important thing here is that RNG is carbon negative.

CLNE also has a large infrastructure for natural gas refueling. They currently have a shitload of stations around the US and Canada, which is great because the candiates for using natural gas most are things like 18 wheelers and other stuff that just make big long trips. It's too bad for them that they were so early, because no one was using natural gas till more recent times (unless you look at other countries, but...).

CLNE is also on a recent uptrend after [getting an upgrade from Credit Suisse to $17.](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/02/19463411/credit-suisse-initiates-coverage-on-clean-energy-fuels-with-outperform-rating-announces-price-target)

**Why Natural Gas?**

As I mentioned before, RNG is carbon negative. More and more commercial vehicles are being converted to natural gas use in order to reduce carbon footprint (70% decrease according to CLNE's own website). More companies are going to be converting their vehicles to use natural gas (in fact, Amazon is already making the move [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-engines-natural-gas-exclusive/exclusive-amazon-orders-hundreds-of-trucks-that-run-on-natural-gas-idUSKBN2A52ML)). This is an easy stepping stone right now, since doing electric fleets is a non-trivial matter (but will eventually happen). In fact, RNG has a lower carbon rating than electric batteries, [according to Commiefornia's Air Resource Board](http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/17518/rng-helps-reach-carbon-negative-milestone-in-california). With demand for natural gas ramping up in the transportation sector, who else but CLNE who provides both RNG and the facilities to refuel with more, which are already established.

**Increasing Natural Gas Demand**

Companies are not changing their fleets to start using natural gas out of the goodness of their hearts. With Buyden now in office, we can expect more sweeping green policies. Most of these policies in the past have focused on a carbon tax, which means carbon intensive fuels will get more expensive. I'd imagine you also get a tax credit for going carbon-negative (hey there's that word again), [which RNG will assist with](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-lauds-passage-of-alternative-fuel-tax-credit-by-congress).

We also see an increase in demand for RNG happening right now. [CLNE last December reported signing deals for 58 million gallons of RNG](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-signs-deals-for-over-58-million-gallons-of-redeem-tm-renewable-natural-gas-to-meet-growing-demand-for-carbon-neutral-fuel-01608030439?tesla=y), which is quite good because in the entirety of 2019 [they only sold 143 million gallons](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-delivers-143-million-gallons-of-redeem-renewable-natural-gas-in-2019-a-30-jump-from-last-year-strong-finish-in-transit-and-solid-waste)

[Lastly, we have new trucks coming in that run on natural gas from Volvo and more](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2020/11/08/natural-gas-vehicles-are-making-inroads-and-want-joe-biden-to-get-aboard/?sh=34de9bfb2d5e). I believe we will continue to see more companies move to natural gas fleets which will continuously pump this stock.

**Partnerships**

CLNE has entered partnerships with BP and has an upcoming one with Total. With BP, [they are joint owning and operating RNG facilities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-to-make-more-carbon-negative-fuel-available-for-transportation-with-bp-01608567431?tesla=y). With BP that will share half the control, and BP fronted $50 million to fund the costs of the join venture. 

With Total [they have a memorandum of understanding](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-and-total-to-develop-additional-carbon-negative-fuel-and-infrastructure-01608548752?tesla=y) to develop more RNG infrastructure. They will similarly be having a 50/50 joint venture, with more support coming from Total. I believe Total is providing $50 million as well for this venture, with an additional credit support of $60 million. 

These deals were fairly recent, so CLNE is on the upswing here with big oil coming in and backing them up for natural gas.

**Expansion**

Well, CLNE was already early to natural gas infrastructure, much to their detriment to be honest. Luckily it's paying off now. I would think they would continue to expand with more refueling stations, and more ways to produce RNG (the joint ventures seem to be pointing in this direction so that's good).

I know there have been some rumblings for an expansion into Hydrogen, which honestly would be huge if their refueling stations can support that. However after talking to some people more familiar with hydrogen fuel, this might be unlikely. Apparently swapping natural gas infrastructure to also support hydrogen is not easy, on account of the fact that hydrogen is pretty liable to explode, plus some other issues (like leaching issues??). I would actually hope they DON'T expand into this area because I believe what they have is currently very strong, and hydrogen stations themselves are negative ROI. 

**The Numbers**

Honestly these don't look bad and if you want me to map this out more I'll do it if there's interest. I'm too lazy to do detailed analysis on this right now though.

**The Play**

As more news comes out this stock will pump further and further. If you want to get a small position you can do that now, and then just load up on any dips. I do expect retracement from today's price a bit. Conservative price target is $22 by Summer, and the bull target is $60 end of year. 

[I am holding 50 contracts of 3/19 $13c, and 50 contracts of 6/18 $17c which I purchased last week (These are printing hard). I also hold 7500 shares at a cost basis of around ~$6.](https://i.ibb.co/CJM6fDY/image.png) I will personally probably roll half my 3/19 $13c's into  4/16 $17c or something like that.

I was skeptical about investing in [BioNano Genomics](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/) after the run-up which saw that share price move from **$0.50 to $10 in two months**. But, I got interested - I read, and I read, and I followed what the scientists were saying, the results of their tech, and I got hooked.

Without going into the science which won't mean much to most of us - it's a company that runs human genome mapping at scale, and allows doctors to detect genetic variants which can lead to new cancer treatments, and a bunch of other cool stuff that reads like science fiction, but is become more and more a reality.

I became a believer after seeing this - they are helping solve children leukemia, for crying out loud:

That story is from their [investors website](https://ir.bionanogenomics.com). There are many others.

Analysts are starting to like them more and more, because of the promise of a $100 genome map:

[If analysts raise PT to $15, market is probably gonna take it to $30](https://preview.redd.it/4hecjqm6hbg61.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b0edb1352e0c7e254b4834bffa2a2c1b2d6b979)

There's plenty of speculation on whether or not ARKG is going to take them on, but honestly, I don't really care. People over at r/BNGO seem to love to debate that, but, personally, I really believe that this is going to enable next generation cancer treatments and move the needle in medicine overall, that I plan to HODL this for years, whatever happens.

Finally, here are my positions. It's not much, but I'm working on it. I sold far dated puts to collect cash premium and invest it into shares. I described that here, if you're interested: [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BNGO/comments/lada1i/selling_bngo_puts_for_shares_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I don't want to speculate about price going to $X in Y months, so I can't suggest any long calls and I don't know if you'll make 10x on this in a month. Probably not, and there's risk here like in anywhere else. Also, I know, this is not r/investing and I should fuck off and take my shit there. That's fine too. I'll just leave this here and people can decide if they want to buy in or not.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) is the #1 nationwide online casino company and the #3 or #4 sports book depending on the state. Short selling, unwarranted institutional wariness of share dilution and the general market focus on sports book instead of online casino has left $RSI grossly undervalued. A massive blow out at Q4 earnings will result in analyst upgrades and a rapid repricing by market makers and institutions seeking exposure to the emerging sector.

&#x200B;

\*\*Overview\*\*

""Sports book is really just kind of a warm up in a lot of ways for an online casino where the real money is made"" - Niccolo De Masi, CEO dMY technologies

&#x200B;

Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) operates the [BetRivers.com](https://betrivers.com) online casino and sports book. They are now fully licensed and operating in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia. They own and operate a casino in New York and already have a New York license making them well positioned for liberalization there. They merged with a dMY Technology Group SPAC on Dec. 31st 2020 with 240 million on the balance sheet to spend on growth.

The online casino business is fundamentally more profitable than sports betting because the average value of a casino player is estimated at $600 while a sports book player could be as little as $20. Estimates put the online casino market at DOUBLE the size of the online sports book market and the online casino industry is really just getting started as more states liberalize.

$RSI is expert at new market entry; they have been first to market in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado and even when they aren't first they are capable of capturing market share in competitive markets such as New Jersey. They also have products which women play which accounts for at least half of the market in online casino. The female market is one that the pure sports book plays miss out on.

Also for some fucking reason they operate a casino and sports book in Colombia ([rushbet.co](https://rushbet.co)) and may make large expansions into other parts of south America as legalization continues. This means they have the expertise necessary for global expansion in the future although the states remains their primary focus and growth driver.

&#x200B;

\*\*The Financials and Strategy\*\*

Unlike other companies in the space Rush Street is already profitable in 2020 and has a strong focus on Return On Invested Capital (ROIC). Q3 gross revenue was $71.9 Million. Q4 revenue is going to be a blow out. Combing through state gambling revenue data and breaking that down by market share my estimate is that Q4 revenue could be as high as $120 Million.

Paired with this blow out will be a \*\*guidance raise to $500 Million for 2021\*\*, which is 2/3 of DraftKings 2021 guidance of $750M.

[https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayC](https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayC)

&#x200B;

What is striking when compared to $DKNG is that their advertising spend was only a quarter of revenue in Q3 while $DKNG spent 155% of their revenue. This will change as they begin to focus on growth, but it shows they are very good at getting return on ad spend. This company should actually be valued close to $DKNG based on growth potential once guidance is raised.

[https://imgur.com/a/RQQXtGg](https://imgur.com/a/RQQXtGg)

&#x200B;

Their focus on attracting \*\*female gamers\*\* is also important to their long term growth potential. The sports book plays with cross sells to casino such as $DKNG will not be able to grow through the female demographic in the same way. \*\*This cannot be understated\*\* as one of the major strategic advantages of $RSI.

[https://imgur.com/a/xzJj26n](https://imgur.com/a/xzJj26n)

&#x200B;

As I said before I expect their trend of rapid growth to continue for Q4 earnings, certainly going to be a blow out based on looking at state gambling revenue numbers. My estimate is that their revenue will be around 110M for Q4. I also expect guidance to be raised to 500M for 2021 due to strong performance in existing markets and the recently opened Michigan market as well as their sports book launch in Virginia.

[https://imgur.com/a/ckTqHhh](https://imgur.com/a/ckTqHhh)

&#x200B;

\*\*Short sellers have entered the chat\*\*

The short interest on $RSI sits at 5.08 M shares as of 01/14/21 representing a 30% increase. Now why would a company already valued at 2.8 Billion and with a comparative valuation of 8-10 Billion compared with $DKNG and $PENN be so heavily shorted at such a low market cap? My conclusion is that an institution with 10s of millions to throw at shorting this stock wants to take advantage of fear of share dilution from warrant calling or to establish a better entry prior to earnings.

&#x200B;

\*\*Commander in GILF Cathie Wood is Bullish on the sector\*\*

On Feb. 2nd ARK disclosed that they had purchased 620,300 shares of $DKNG. This is extremely bullish for the sector. I am highly confident that after Q4 earnings ARK will be purchasing shares in $RSI as well due its strategic advantages relative to $DKNG and exposure to the female demographic. For such a small market cap company this will be a major catalyst.

&#x200B;

\*\*Institutions are bullish\*\*

Fidelity has increased their holdings to 14% as of today: [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf)

Alliance Bernstein holds a 6% position reported today: [http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/e883778d-e759-4a85-91c1-3242ed110720.pdf](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/e883778d-e759-4a85-91c1-3242ed110720.pdf)

&#x200B;

\*\*Final notes\*\*

Jerome ""[The Bus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeNLuN7PKTo)"" Bettis, Steelers legend and hall of fame running back, is their brand ambassador... This company knows their target audience and how to appeal to them, likely more 'classic' ambassadors to come to attract even more boomer and Gen X degenerates. Keep in mind these are the gamblers with big money to spend, the average age of an online casino gambler is 42.

This stock has been grossly underpriced due to short selling. The terms of the SPAC deal were not unfavorable and all the insiders held their shares through the merger banking on growth in the market - \*\*management owns 77% of the company\*\*. This is a true value play on a well managed company in an emerging industry with a market size in the hundreds of billions. I plan to hold shares long term.

&#x200B;

I will post a part 2 breaking down their latest S-1 filing and Q4 revenue by state when they release their Q4 earnings date.

&#x200B;

Do your own research.

(CLNE)** 🚀🚀🚀

  This is not financial advice, do your own DD before investing. Yada yada. 

I have made huge gains over the course of my time on this sub, upwards of $400,000. I consider myself a heavy weight investor ready to put in my next bet. I feel this is important so you can understand the weight of my conviction I have for this company.

**Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is a company that prides itself in being one of the leading providers of clean fuel for the transportation market in North America. 

As of right now they are currently involved in:

* Regional Fleets of Trucks

* Commercial Airlines

* Public Transit

* Construction Vehicles

* Ships/Cargo Boats/Vessels/Cruise Lines

**Argument #1**

Undervalued. At it's current price of $17 a share and 600% price movement over the last 3 months, it's a no brainer that this will continue to climb this year. [3 month graph](https://imgur.com/BNB6mnx) 🚀🚀🚀

**Financials**

* Market Cap - 2.94B

* P/E Ratio - 79.62 

* Cash on Hand - 96 million

What causes a companies value to go up? The potential for future catalysts. With Biden in presidency, CLNE is a huge candidate for getting a large piece of the clean energy stimulus and providing eco friendly alternatives across North America. It's reign has just begun.  



**Argument #2**

Biden plans to pump $2 trillion into clean energy alternatives. He plans on creating 10 million jobs in clean energy sectors. He's only been in office since January 20th, the momentum will pick up shortly don't miss the rocket. If you read [President Biden's Plan to build a sustainable clean energy future](https://joebiden.com/climate-labor-fact-sheet/) you will immediately understand why this is one of the clearest investments to make right now

 **TLDR:** Biden will make **far reaching** investments into clean energy transit methods by reducing fuel emissions in public and commercial transit systems.

While Electric Vehicles are definitely the long long long term play.  **Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is the realistic solution in a shorter period of time to achieve Biden's goals.

**Argument #3**

The recent hype and growth of the opportunities in Clean Energy are very apparent with the large stimulus packages including a lot of subsidies for clean energy companies. The company itself has recently been partnering with well-known industry leaders that want to be first-movers in the space to transition to greener consumption of transportation.

The [CEO, Andrew Littlefair](https://imgur.com/eKOQD7Z) owns 0.7% of shares outstanding. Current shares outstanding are 198M, and of this, the CEO himself owns approximately 1.38 million shares. He definitely believes in the company!

**My Price Targets**

I believe the momentum for this company is just beginning. $40 by June, and $65 by end of year are my conservative estimates. Today we saw a 40% price movement because of a deal made with [LA transit bus systems](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-alert%3A-clean-energy-fuels-corp.-adds-30-after-striking-deal-with-la-metro-2021-02-08?amp)

The potential for e-commerce companies, transit systems, airports, shipping companies and trading ports converting to Clean Fuels is a huge game changer and allow for *MANY* more catalysts in the future. The surface has only just been scratched.

[My position, $30,000 in shares](https://imgur.com/UE6y8Qx) Yes I bought at the top, today. I'm sure this is only the beginning. I will add more to my positions later to average down and add some leaps as well.

*\*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This is not investment advice. All information stated in this post is my own opinion, and some information may be unknowingly inaccurate or outdated. Please do your own due diligence before investing your money. I currently hold a long position on various Altria LEAPs.\**

  


 Nicotine products have been in continuous use in North America for thousands of years [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tobacco). Upon the arrival of the Spanish to the New World, tobacco use spread rapidly throughout the globe, becoming hugely popular not only across Europe, but also in far-flung Asia and the Ottoman Empire. The only comparable product to conquer the world so thoroughly is the ubiquitous, similarly addictive, mighty coffee bean.

 By the 1900's, smoking had become a huge commercial enterprise. Glitz and glam surrounded the tobacco industry. All of your Grandmother's favorite actors smoked [\[2\]](https://www.dw.com/en/famous-smokers-on-screen/g-19021895). Many high schools had smoking lounges for the students (of course, your Nana still regularly snuck out behind the bleachers to have a private puff with the quarterback). Nicotine use was a normal and accepted part of life.

We are all, of course, familiar with the rest of the story. Studies came out showing just how damaging cigarette usage was on the human body. Campaigns were begun, laws were enacted, and Big Tobacco became Public Enemy #1 [\[3\]](https://www.thetruth.com/about-truth)

Fast forward to today. For the past few decades, despite decreasing cigarette volumes, the tobacco industry has remained immensely profitable. Big players in the cigarette industry have been able to compensate for declining cigarette volumes by raising prices. Cash flows from cigarette smoking have never been higher. Yet looking at the stock market performance of the tobacco industry over the past 5 years, you would think that the industry was on life support.

No company has lately fared worse than Altria ($MO). Despite growing income at a 5.9% CAGR since 2017 amid a backdrop of stabilizing declines in cigarette consumption [\[4\]](https://s25.q4cdn.com/409251670/files/doc_presentations/2021/01/28/Presentation.pdf), the company's stock remains 45% off its 2017 high. Much of the underperformance can be attributed to investors losing confidence in the company's management after a series of questionable investment decisions, including taking a 35% stake in JUUL, a 45% stake in Chronos (a Canadian marijuana company), and a 10% stake in Anheuser-Busch.

These investments have performed poorly over the past few years. High-profile teen deaths from illicit THC vaping products were widely linked to JUUL usage by our sensationalist media [\[5\]](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/e-cigarrettes-vaping-lung-injuries-deaths-top-science-stories-2019-yir), causing Altria to write-down its initial $12B investment in JUUL to a value of only \~$2B today. The bubble in the marijuana stock market popped in 2018, causing a 30% reduction in the value of Altria's Chronos stake. And the rise of the craft beer industry has continued to weigh on the profitability of Anheuser-Busch.

Despite the short-term pitfalls, I will argue that it is reasonable to believe that Altria has positioned itself very well for the future. And with all of these factors weighing down the stock over the past few years, I believe $MO is ripe for a turnaround.

**I have a 2023 price target for $MO of $90 which, given the low IV Altria enjoys, implies a 30x (3,000%) return on MO Jan 2023 65c LEAPs.**

My thesis relies on four key beliefs:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

1. The company's core business is under-valued
2. Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes
3. Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized
4. Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO

**1) The Company's core business is under-valued**

Altria enjoys a stunningly low forward P/E of 8.7 and a stunningly high dividend yield of 8.1% [\[6\]](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MO). Various online discounted cash flow analyses of Altria give it an intrinsic value between $62-$72 [\[7\]](https://www.stock-analysis-on.net/NYSE/Company/Altria-Group-Inc/DCF/Present-Value-of-FCFF) [\[8\]](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-mo/altria-group/news/are-investors-undervaluing-altria-group-inc-nysemo-by-44). These analyses are very conservative in that they only take into account Altria's current business, which is predominantly smokeable tobacco products.

There are also bright spots in Altria's miscellaneous businesses that these DCF models don't account for, such as the fast-growing ""on!"" line of nicotine pouches, or the likely reinstatement of Anheuser-Busch's dividend after it was paused last year due to Covid.

We'll ignore these bright spots for now and give Altria's core business a conservative price target of $65.

**2) Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes**

*\*Please note: I am not a doctor. All health claims made in this post reflect only my own opinions.\**

Nicotine has gotten a bad rap in the past 50 years, but on its own there isn't much research I've seen to suggest it's any more dangerous than caffeine. The big problem with nicotine is simply the delivery mechanism. Smoking large amounts of anything is bad for your lungs. Vaping exposes your lungs to far fewer ancillary chemicals in much smaller doses than traditional smoking. For instance, Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., director of clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease, says about vaping “there’s almost no doubt that they expose you to fewer toxic chemicals than traditional cigarettes.” [\[9\]](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/5-truths-you-need-to-know-about-vaping#:~:text=1%3A%20Vaping%20Is%20Less%20Harmful,many%20of%20which%20are%20toxic.)

Altria surveyed the landscape in 2017 and determined that acquiring a stake in JUUL was its best way to position itself for the future. Since then, JUUL's name has been dragged through the mud and associated with many teen deaths. However, these deaths were later determined to be caused by unauthorized THC products unlinked to JUUL [\[10\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/25/cdc-most-people-who-died-vaping-linked-disease-used-products-containing-thc/). JUUL's case for harm reduction in the nicotine space is still intact.

The FTC filed an anti-trust case recently attempting to block Altria's stake in JUUL [\[11\]](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/191-0075/altria-groupjuul-labs-matter). This case is due to be heard this spring. The uncertainty around JUUL's future has weighed on $MO, but in my opinion all outcomes of this case are positive:

1) Altria is forced to divest its stake in JUUL

This is not ideal, but as part of the JUUL acquisition, Altria agreed to not compete in the vaping space against JUUL. If Altria is forced to divest, it can capitalize on the recent decline in the quality and brand value of JUUL (just check out r/juul to see the declining sentiment around the brand) to bring its own high-quality product onto the market.

2) Altria is allowed to keep its stake in JUUL

In this case, Altria can capitalize on JUUL's troubles by acquiring a larger stake in the company at a discount. Altria can then flood JUUL with the cash it needs to help rebuild its quality and brand. This is the ideal case in my opinion, for both JUUL and Altria.

Setting aside JUUL for the moment, Altria has the exclusive rights to distribute in the USA Phillip Morris's FDA-approved IQoS product [\[12\]](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/altria-and-philip-morris-iqos-3-device-wins-fda-ap/). This is a ""heat not burn"" product that is more similar to existing cigarettes than vaping, but still reduces the number of harmful chemicals inhaled. This product is already popular in Europe and Japan, and is just beginning to be marketed in the USA. One major advantage of this product is that it produces no smoke, and so may potentially end up being allowed in restaurants, bars, and offices.

**3) Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized**

Altria is the one company with the regulatory experience and distribution networks necessary to gain substantial market share in the nascent marijuana industry. Altria has been quietly filing patent after patent for THC and CBD vaping devices [\[13\]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisroberts/2020/10/02/tobacco-giant-altria-is-securing-technology-in-new-frontier-marijuana/). In fact, people in the fledgling marijuana industry are so worried about Altria's entry into the market that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, when speaking about his upcoming federal legalization bill, recently said ""I don’t want to see these big tobacco companies coming in and shoving everyone out"" [\[14\]](https://mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/). (Note however that, while this position may play well with Senator Schumer's base for now, having a marijuana industry that is run by well-established and responsible companies is ultimately the best outcome for public health, and so it is unlikely that any steps will be taken to bar Altria from competing in the free market of marijuana products).

**4) Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO**

Would this really be WallStreetBets if I didn't mention Michael Burry? Burry's fund Scion Asset Management had 5% of its portfolio in $MO as of Q3 2020, making Altria its 13th largest holding \[\[15\]([https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM](https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM)). For context, this is about half the weight that Michael Burry's fund had in GameStop during the same quarter.

If nothing else, this is a good sanity check on the analysis here.

**Summary**

In summary, it's likely that the true value of Altria's core business is closer to $65 than the current price of $43. Add on top of that the potential for success in the vaping category, and the potential for growth into the marijuana market, and it is easy to see $MO adding an additional 20-30B in market cap to reach a price of $90 by 2023.

IV for 2023 LEAPs sits at \~20%. MO Jan 2023 65c's are currently priced at $0.77. If Altria reaches $90 by 2023, these options will be worth at least $25. This would represent a &amp;gt;3,100% return.

For this reason, I believe that Altria LEAPs represent a unique opportunity for asymmetric upside. Please let me know your thoughts below, I'd appreciate counter-arguments that highlight any flaws in the reasoning outlined above."|2021-02-09 09:14:11.474467|../output/raw/2021/02/09/DueDiligence_flair_DD_091412.csv|DueDiligence|['HUGE']|[]|['IV', 'I', 'I', 'CAGR', 'JUUL', 'THC', 'JUUL', 'B', 'JUUL', 'B', 'I', 'I', '$MO', 'I', '$MO', 'IV', 'MO', '$MO', 'E', 'DCF', 'I', 'M', 'D', 'M', 'P', 'H', 'JUUL', 'THC', 'JUUL', 'FTC', 'JUUL', '$MO', 'JUUL', 'JUUL', 'JUUL', 'JUUL', 'JUUL', 'JUUL', 'JUUL', 'JUUL', 'USA', 'S', 'USA', 'THC', 'CBD', 'I', 'I', '$MO', '$MO', 'B', 'IV', 'MO', 'I']|['THC', 'MO', 'MO', 'MO', 'MO', 'THC', 'MO', 'THC', 'CBD', 'MO', 'MO', 'MO']

# Are they making good money?

EPS (TTM) is 116.69, it's actually earning A LOT OF money compared to GME (GUH). I found this stock filtering for high earning companies because of my GME shares lol.

# How do they fare against all the other bio testing stonks?

Let's see how many PCR machines they sell compared to others. IMO, it further highlights how absurdly discounted Bio-Rad is compared to other suppliers.

[These are from Thomas.net, an unbiased source talking about finding suppliers for various industries. See bio-rad on #9 top supplier. But Qiagen right above it at #8, trades at 67.29 PER \(yahoo finance\) compared to Bio-Rad's 5.18.](https://preview.redd.it/ikvfqh3njcg61.png?width=2085&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9e1e7fefa729e46a16c188660aa4b669142822e)

# So is Bio-rad actually selling equipment??

Let's ask the scientists.

A scientist chick called Mary Johnson at labome? (some weird science organization) analyzed how many science papers cited using Bio-rad / other suppliers to see what PCR equipment labs should buy.

>Three suppliers dominate the citations. They are Thermo Fisher, **Bio-Rad** (including brand MJ Research) 🚀🚀 and Roche. The most cited models are Thermo Fisher 7x000 series, iCycler/MyIQ from **Bio-Rad** 🚀🚀, and LightCycler from Roche.

&#x200B;

What is HUYA?

HUYA Inc. operates live game streaming platforms in China. Its platforms enable broadcasters and viewers to interact during live streaming (emotes, donations, subs). Its live streaming content covers a library of games, including mobile, PC, and console games; and other entertainment genres, such as talent shows, anime, outdoor activities, live chats, online theatre, and other genres. The company operates Nimo TV, a game live streaming platform primarily in Southeast Asia and Latin America. It also provides online advertising and marketing services. In addition, the company provides software development and Internet value added services. As of December 31, 2019, its live streaming content covered approximately 3,800 games. The company was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Guangzhou, the People’s Republic of China. HUYA Inc. is a subsidiary of Tencent Holdings Limited.

&#x200B;

* With Tencent's backing, Huya is merging with the second largest game streamer in China, DouYu (estimated 80% market share behemoth post merger).
* Huya is still growing strongly on its own with or without said merger.
* 31x 2020 forward earnings does not seem too expensive for a company currently showing strong growth in sales and earnings, while being the game live-streaming leader in China.
* News broke out that China has anti-trust concerns with said merger between Huya and DouYu. The 8.5% drop today happened swiftly and the stock price is hovering above the 20 SMA.

$SKLZ is the only straight play on an American company with online gaming esports streaming potential. Their website is basically yahoo games from early 2000s. Recent NFL multi year contract with no mobile product yet. The only possible reason why valuations like this exist is their profit margins on their Bingo, Pool, Solitaire... yahoo 2000s games. Careful with this one as once NFL takes a cut from the licensing agreement the margins won't be so gravy. Otherwise this is a house of cards on 15.83B valuation based on 162M revenue grossing 153M. Great profit margins, but valuation is beyond insane with no NFL mobile app. For the smooth brains, you need to multiply 162M x 100 to even get close to the 15.83B valuation.

Gross Profit **153.59M**

**Conclusion**

Huya trades under 4x revenue (Revenue **1.53B |** Market Cap  **5.77B)**  for being a leader in online esports streaming in the most populous country with the most gamers in the world. Where else can you find such a gem in this market? The 8.5% drop today from anti-trust concerns is simply smoke and mirrors. With or without the merger between Huya and DouYU this stock is a buy at the current valuation. China and anti-trust concerns are a joke. BABA had anti-trust concerns in Dec 2020 for not reporting prior takeovers and were fined $75k. BABA is valued at 710.47B.

I wanted to include as many pictures in my DDs as you guys have chromosomes so please...

Enjoy retards. and oh yes: Fuck the tutes.

TLDR - refer to the end of the Google doc above.

Edit: this stock will be at least a 6 bagger 10 years from now. That said, we don’t know how long the tutes will control RKT. It may be safer to buy RKT shares and RKT calls that expire in June or later. You guys will make money on this trade trust me - just don’t be greedy and go for weeklies; making money off those is far from guaranteed.

Double edit: with over 40 percent short interest, a $1B buyback (that cuts RKT’s float in half) zero insider selling and potential catalysts - RKT could easily squeeze into the $50s in the near term if the stars align. And if it doesn’t squeeze, this shit is still going to melt up.

This is my first DD so please leave feedback. 


I believe Qualcomm has been brutally oversold. I expect a large rebound in the following months. 

Following their [most recent earnings report Q1 2021](https://investor.qualcomm.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001728949-21-000022/0001728949-21-000022.pdf) on the 4th of February their stock dropped 10% in 2 days. However, their earning report was strong and they maintain confidence that they will have a strong Q2 earnings too with an EPS of $1.65 (analysts were expecting an EPS of $1.57). The Q1 ER had an EPS of $2.17 per diluted share which is more than double their Q1 2020 $0.99 EPS. Although their ER beating high estimates of $8 billion in sales by an extra $200 million, [their licensing division brought in $1.35 billion of an estimated $1.43 billion.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/qualcomm-stock-earnings-chips-apple-51612390489) Their equipment and services division brought in $6.440 billion. They had an operating income of 2.5 billion.


Qcom has a healthy balance sheet with $7 billion in cash and very little short term debt. They do have $15 billion of long term doubt, which would be entirely covered by their cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. They can chip away at this debt slowly in this low interest period whilst focusing on R&D.


All sounds good, so why did the stock tumble so bad? I’ve looked at different sources and have read that business analysts are worried about the limited manufacturing capacity across the semiconductor industry. However, I believe this is bullish. With demand higher than supply, it allows for the flexibility in price and larger profits whilst reinvesting back into manufacturing. Furthermore, I do not believe the dip is for this reason as other US chip producers such as Broadcom, Nvidia and the likes also are experiencing the same chip shortage and their stocks have not dipped in the same way. AMD has dipped in a similar way after beating earnings in true fashion and is showing signs of recovery which makes me bullish of a rebound. 

 It is possible the sell off may be due to [citi downgrading their PT to $165 from $194.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/qualcomm-stock-gets-a-downgrade-at-citi-after-earnings-2021-02-04) This is still higher than the current price by a bit but is slightly more bearish. Qualcomm has 77% of shares held by institutions, so you’d expect less volatility considering recently they have been loading up on shares, however, this data is prior to earnings. Updated figures on institutional holding reports are filed within 45 days after calendar quarter end - the 21st of March. [The most credible reason for the dip may be due to analysts having higher forecasts for the licensing division, however, I do believe the reaction has been very disproportionate especially when following EPS for the next quarter remains strong.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/04/why-qualcomm-stock-is-falling-today/)

The biggest thing with ON is institutional ownership. So if you don’t want to take my word for it, take the over ten-billion down that vanguard, fidelity, Blackrock and a number of large brokers collectively have on this company. 

I’m a big fan of Hassane, this dude is making some moves to better position the company marginally to capitalize on the majorly emerging EV, Alternative Energy, Aerospace, and 5G markets. With demand currently outweighing supply, semiconductors whether ON or not will be strong investments, and are key to most alternative energy methods, so both markets will grow and evolve in tandem with each other. 

ON in comparison to the other semi stocks is much lower priced, and with institutions holding a majority of the float, a large amount of 2023 convertibles, and still increasing their share positions, once a majority of the general public moves to semi’s it will explode similar to PLUG power, which was a near identical situation. Although there may be some convertibles causing a degree of share dilution, with the increases in broader market investment the impact should be fairly small. 

Most importantly to all of this the options are cheap as absolute shit. I believe we are going to see a large spike in Theta value by April, making calls now a much better deal then the near future. You can get ATM contracts for $250, meaning it only has to cross 42.5 by April to break even, which is a fucking joke, and what I’d call a great options deal.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**; Teradata (TDC) was THE longtime leader in data warehousing until 2014, when it failed to pivot to the cloud, so Snowflake stepped in. As of last week, it would seem that TDC is back with a sexy cloud offering that will compete directly with Snowflake (see last week's earnings release [here](https://s23.q4cdn.com/501457330/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/TDC-4Q20-Earnings-Release-(1).pdf)) TDC stock is worth $70 in the immediate near-term, possibly $150-300 if valued like Snowflake.

\*\*\*CEO Steve McMillan even suggests that TDC is winning customers back from Snowflake. **This is HUGE** (more below)

**Overview**

Teradata is an enterprise data warehousing business, i.e. TDC enables customers/businesses to access/manage data, generate insights, and use these findings to make informed decisions.

**Data Warehousing Industry / Tailwinds**

* Data warehousing is the process of capturing, storing, managing and analyzing data. Pretty catch-all phrase but this is a catch-all business, fam. It applies to literally everything.
* Companies use data warehousing software to acquire, aggregate and integrate data from multiple sources (different geographies, business units, etc).
* Analytical services are layered on to help businesses make informed, data-driven decisions
* Total addressable market is $81 billion, according to Snowflake in 2020.
   * Snowflake’s S-1 filing: “...the markets for Analytics Data Management and Integration Platforms and Business Intelligence and Analytics Tools, which we believe we address, will have a combined value of **$56 billion by the end of 2020 and $84 billion by the end of 2023.**”
   * That’s an industry-wide CAGR of \~15%

**Company History**

TDC was a pioneer in data warehousing. The company launched in 1979 and developed a cutting edge relational database platform by 1984. TDC was acquired by AT&T (NCR) in the early 90’s, and created the world’s first 1TB database system for Walmart in 1992. In 1996, it spun off from AT&T in ‘96 as NCR Corp. TDC spun off from NCR in 2007 as an independent company and the largest standalone data warehousing biz. So 40+ years of experience in data warehousing.

Chief Technology Officer Stephen Brobst has been involved in some shape or form since the NCR days in the early 90's. He has been CTO since 1999. In 2014, Brobst was ranked the top 4th CTO in the US - yea up there with Tesla and Amazon CTO's ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/teradata-executive-stephen-brobst-named-one-of-top-four-chief-technology-officers-in-us-276001651.html)). Brobst is clearly a visionary and top mind in the business.

TDC was historically focused on the legacy server construct. Back then, the thought of a utility-like public cloud (AWS) becoming the industry standard was laughable. Companies ran their own servers and relied on on-prem solutions. TDC deployed on-prem database software, servers, analytical software and related consulting services.

TDC was a well-known name in the business world; in 2008, customers included Coca-Cola, FedEx, Wells Fargo and a long list of other boomer stocks. Historically, IBM and Oracle were listed as top competitors. Pre 2014, Teradata was considered THE data warehousing leader (ahead of ORCL, IBM) by Gartner. Today, it’s cloud product is back at the top (yes, above Snowflake, see below).

Over the years TDC shifted focus from the legacy data warehousing business to upselling big data analytics and marketing solutions. This was the investment case in \~2013 when I pitched the stock to my college investment club (shoutout CIG). However, TDC’s legacy offering wasn’t well-suited for the cloud, which was starting to gain a lot of hype and traction. This rustled everyone’s jimmies and TDC started to collapse from 2012-2014, when Snowflake launched its cloud-based offering and started stealing market share. Emerging tech like Hadoop and Amazon’s AWS native offering (Redshift) were also major threats.

So there you have it, TDC was king of the “data warehousing” hill, failed to pivot to the cloud, lost to Snowflake and was in decline...until now.

**TDC today**

Teradata has rebranded itself as a “hybrid cloud analytics software provider,” meaning it can run its database software (Teradata Vantage) on-prem, in the public cloud, private cloud or all of the above. Literally exactly what Snowflake does, perhaps even better (more on that later).

TDC was purpose-built for complex queries. The company spent the past 40+ years leading/ innovating and accumulating 600+ patents. This IP is the result of massive spending and effort over the years - the result was a company that eventually enjoyed 25% cash flow returns on capital before Snowflake went and punched them in the balls. Now TDC is coming back with a vengeance.

TDC Vantage is a fixed-cost, scalable software platform. The company is basically taking decades of research and refined technique, and migrating it to the cloud. R&D has already been spent and TDC claims to be multiple years ahead of Snowflake (see below). Now it just needs to move this IP to the cloud and print cash.

The company is now run by CEO Steve McMillan, who previously tried to compete against TDC at IBM (19 years) and Oracle...and failed (his own admission, see article below). McMillan was brought in to turn the company around after it failed under previous leadership to pivot to the cloud. Now, he  is executing better than anyone expected.

Last week, TDC shocked investors when it broke out cloud-based annual recurring revenues (ARRs) of $100 million, up 160% from a year prior. This was the first mention of their success in the cloud and a surprise to longs and shorts alike.

In the most recent earnings call, sell-side analysts were glowing:

**Cloud Implications**

* Cloud-based subscriptions are cheap to deploy. They don’t involve massive up-front costs to acquire a perpetual license/on-prem deployment. For those that don't know, this is like subscribing to Netflix vs. buying movies yourself. the former is much cheaper up-front.
* TDC users pay based on their computing needs, so revenues are NOT recognized ratably like other SaaS stocks. Revenues are recognized as customers compute, so revenue growth is directly tied to the volume of usage of the platform. This is a VERY attractive business model and effectively a toll bridge on cloud computing.
* TDC’s legacy on-prem business **WAS** lumpy because of the large upfront cost, which resulted in long sales cycles and required executive/CEO-level approvals to complete a sale. New cloud-based offering is lower-cost up front and easier to sell. This will enable shorter sales cycles and faster growth.
* Large scale data warehousing requires a lot of human touch/tailoring. TDC is very experienced in helping big businesses with these large database transitions. They have a solid consulting business purpose-built for this. These consultants didn’t get stupid overnight - TDC can leverage its years of experience to offer a more tailored experience vs. Snowflake, which has only been doing this for 6 years and doesn’t have a massive consulting effort.
* While TDC has been in decline for years, it’s bled customers at a slower-than expected pace. This is because many TDC customers spent a shit load of money upfront to integrate their business data on TDC databases. These customers still fork over $1.5 billion to TDC per year - they will probably be converted over to the cloud-based offering (which results in more attractive economics and earnings visibility). This last part is a crucial aspect of the valuation (below).

**Competitive Advantages**

* *Network effects*: as customers move data to the cloud, the more easily data can be exchanged between customers that share the same platform
   * Snowflake cited this as a competitive advantage, it applies to TDC as well
* *High switching costs*: adopting a large database is a time consuming process that is also a pain in the ass. Once complete, people don’t want to leave. This is evident in TDC customer retention even in spite of cloud disruptions.
* *Cost savings*: data insights result in cost savings for the customer. this is the difference between life and death of business these days
* *Intellectual Property*: Decades’ worth of IP (600+ patents) and reputation as an industry pioneer

**\*\*\*\* Competitive Positioning \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* (READ THIS IF YOU READ ANYTHING AT ALL)**

Not only is TDC pivoting to the cloud to survive, but research suggests that it might even be better than Snowflake.

In a recent interview, CEO Steve McMillan said the following

>“I’m going to say a couple things that will surprise some people,” he says. “I think our 40-year heritage in helping organizations get the best out of their data \[gives us\] a set of experiences and a set of capabilities and a set of technology advances that ***Snowflake are going to have to take a long time to catch up with us***\*.\*“Look, if you want to set up a simple data mart with a little bit of DSS \[decision support systems\], Snowflake is going to work fine for you,” McMillan continues. “For companies that want to operate at enterprise scale–and I haven’t met a small company that doesn’t want to be a big company–and they want to operate at scale in a really cost-effective way, ***Teradata is a better choice than Snowflake.”***

He goes a step further

>“We have differentiation that we think is ***four or five years ahead where Snowflake*** \[is\] in terms of things like workload management and data governance and some of the core, deep SQL engine capabilities that we have in our product that just aren’t replicated inside Snowflake,”

And the finale

>“When we see customers making that transition, making that migration to cloud, they’ve not been able to get the same level of performance and scale, either from the native cloud providers or the likes of Snowflake, in terms of just operating at that level of scale and consistency,” McMillan says. “So it’s really interesting as we double down on the \[cloud\] message and we’ve taken it back to ***customers who may have moved off Teradata and tried these cloud providers, we’re seeing those workloads start to come back to Teradata in the cloud***.”

**\*\*\*\*\* IN OTHER WORDS, MCMILLAN SUGGESTS THAT TDC IS STEALING CUSTOMERS BACK FROM SNOWFLAKE. THIS IS HUGE. (LINK BELOW) \*\*\*\*\***

Gartner also suggests that Teradata Vantage is superior to Snowflake in every use case:

* Gartner scored Teradata higher than Snowflake in every use case of its Cloud Database Management Systems
   * [https://www.teradata.com/Resources/Analyst-Reports/2020-Gartner-Capabilities-for-Cloud-DBMS-Analytical-Use-Cases](https://www.teradata.com/Resources/Analyst-Reports/2020-Gartner-Capabilities-for-Cloud-DBMS-Analytical-Use-Cases)
* Teradata Vantage was listed as a market leader ahead of snowflake in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Database Management Systems:

&#x200B;

**Valuation**

*Snowflake (SNOW)*

* Snowflake IPO’d in 2020 at an \~$80 billion valuation. They claim that they are chasing an $80 billion end market (annually), which has people excited, and rightfully so - this is a pretty exciting time for cloud-based data analytics.
* In the trailing 4 quarters, Snowflake posted $480 million in revenues. The stock trades at $300, or an $80 billion market cap. This implies a \~160x price-to-sales ratio (which is frankly ridiculous imo).
* During its first earnings call, SNOW reported 119% revenue growth

*Teradata (TDC)*

* As of close (2/8/21), TDC was a $5.3 billion company.
* In its earnings report last week, TDC reported that its emerging public cloud business reached $106 million in annual recurring revenues, up 165% from a year prior...this is ape shit growth. The type that rustles people’s jimmies.
* TDC is guiding for another 160% increase in Q1 2020, and a 100% increase in FY 2021.
* In total TDC reported $1.4 billion of recurring revenue, most of this is the legacy business.
* Before the earnings announcement, which caught Wall Street/Snowflake investors off guard, TDC was valued at $2.7 billion - so it’s fair to say this is what the legacy business is worth. This is your valuation floor.
* At 160x revenues (what Snowflake is being valued at), TDC’s public cloud business is worth $17 billion. I’d also point out (again) that TDC is a 40-year innovator here and is rated higher than Snowflake by Gartner in all use-case categories.
* Now, I think it’s fair to say that in growing the cloud business, TDC is going to convert legacy customers from the on-prem solution to the public cloud solution. If it converts another $100 million of its $1.5 billion to the cloud biz, that’s another $17 billion valuation. Now we’re looking at a $34 billion business.
* 34 billion / 5.3 billion = 6.4x upside

**Price Targets**

* Base case: $7 billion ($64 stock price). This is below JMP’s recent price target ($70). At $7 billion, TDC’s cloud biz would be valued at $4.3 billion (43x revenues, or 75% lower than SNOW's valuation).
* Bull case: $17 billion ($155 stock price). At this level, TDC’s public cloud biz would be valued at 170x revenues (same as SNOW).
* Moon case: $34 billion ($300+ stock price). At this price, TDC’s public cloud biz would get the same valuation as SNOW, but we would also value another $100 million of revenues at 170x revenues, which would represent future conversions from the company’s existing legacy customer base to the cloud-native solution.

**Near-term catalysts**

* Recent earnings results shocked investors in a positive way, but not all of the gains have been made. It takes the average buyside investor 2 weeks to complete DD, so we're still getting ahead of the big money here.
* TDC has 20% short interest, so 1 in 5 shares are sold short. These shorts are going to cover ASAP because the recent earnings report was nothing short of transformative. TDC never broke out its cloud-based annual recurring revenues until last week - this basically killed the short thesis and turned TDC from a deep value stock into an aggressive cloud-based saas business overnight.
* People are realizing that TDC was a hidden gem and is the cheapest way to play the parabolic growth market of cloud-based data warehousing/analytics. (see yesterday's Barron’s [article](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teradata-rally-continues-as-investors-discover-a-cheap-cloud-software-play-51612823248?siteid=yhoof2))
* Given the massive valuation spread between SNOW and TDC, and the apparent technological superiority of TDC, we could be on the right side of a popular hedge fund pair trade (long TDC, short SNOW).

\#1 Covid Vaccines- there is a potential for CVS to open up a section of there locations to administer Covid Vaccines after the increasing pressure on current administers. Meaning money from the government to cover this. Secondly,  Have you ever gone to CVS and just picked up your meds? I sure haven’t. I leave with that much Sh!t I didn’t need its not funny. SO imagine more foot traffic and more random impulse purchases. Like “Oh wow, my wife’s boyfriend could use these 10 packs of Gatorades and vibrating Cuck Ring”.  So, increase in sales 

\#2- Fundamentals- skip this is if you don’t believe in the F word. 

· According to a number of research houses it is trading roughly at a 50% discount to it’s fair value

· PE Ratio is 11.9X which is lower than the industry average of 19x and Market 25x

· Future earnings estimated to grow at 9% on current conditions 

· Long term Assets $173.68 B vs $101.74B Liabilities

· \*Concern over short term assets $59B vs Short term Liabilities $62B

· Debt has been reducing since 2019 (not bad during a pandemic) 

· Interest payments on debt well covered by EBIT (6.4x) 

· Dividend pay out that has been stable and Is well covered by earnings 

\#3 New CEO Karen Lynch- I am not going to put her whole credentials in but it is quite impressive. There are many indications that she wants to revamp to the traditional offering- with the likes of delivery services and further unique ‘in house’ offerings. 

\#4  Institutional  Ownership 

· Vanguard $6.4 B (8%)

· BlackRock $5.6 B (7%)

· State Street $3.4B (4%)

· Capital Research $2.8 B (3.5%)

· Morgan Stanley $1.5B (1.8%)

\#5 Bureau of Healthcare working on their side

Amazon’s disruption is still quite some time away as- it will still require doctors to designate it, and patients to request it, when writing prescriptions. At some practices, switching prescriptions from one pharmacy to another has to be done during an office visit -- and many patients are avoiding those for now.

\#6 More than a Pharmacy 

· Aetna – Health Insurance plans 

· Minute Clinic- providing access to doctors within or close to their stores 

· CVS intend to add dietitians and yoga to their locations along the lines of their healthhub 

· Potential Vaccine Adminsting stations. 

Earnings are expected on the 16th of this month. It’s not looking like they are going to shoot the lights out but this has been factored in. 

TLDR

· High Ownership from mutual Funds

· 10% of Michael Burry’s portfolio

· Potential to be the location and service to administer the COVID vaccine. 

· In house Doctors to prescribe medication (Amazon still requires visit to the doctor) 

\- A company that is resilient and continues to find a way to keep moving forward

This will only change once batteries are dense enough to make electric planes - we're not there and even if we'd come up with the technology tomorrow, it'd still take many years to replace all planes.

GEVO is still a small cap, but they might totally play along XOM (200 billion), Shell (120 billion) or BP (74 billion) in a couple of years. Worst case at this point is that they will stay where they are, I just don't see how the stock could go down given the circumstances - the next 4 years will be smooth sailing under Biden.

Also I should mention that you're basically helping the environment by investing in this. You'll make it easier for the company to raise cash and be successful.

Yearly revenue up about 58%. But that's not even the main draw for me.


**THE BEST PART**

They are expecting nearly **$2 billion** in revenue for 2021. And the current market cap is $4.16 billion. They are literally trading at only about twice the 2021 revenues. Which is the cheapest valuation for a company growing at this rate. [AMD is trading at over 10 times their expected revenues in 2021...](https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e44df3ff133f4000628a0be/960x0.jpg)

For such a small market cap stock, CRSR is an absolute steal 

And they are profitable quarterly and yearly! Planning to launch a bunch of new stuff this year. 

Potential acquire target which will sent them over 40% up overnight.

The stock will double in no time..buy! 🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

**Major Highlights**

* 55% increased revenue YOY
* Over 100% increased revenue
* Full year of surpassing earnings expectations
* Outlook to increase revenue by another 5-10% throughout 2021

**Competitors**

* Primary competitor is LOGI.  CRSR outpaces LOGI in earnings growth.  CRSR operates at a market cap of 4B, compared to LOGI's 15B, despite having a revenue approx. half of LOGI's, pointing to CRSR being undervalued.

**Issues**

* Low float, leading to higher volatility.  Can be a benefit if looking at playing options spreads (keep that IV crush away from me)
* IPO Lockup.  Ends on March 22, so expect a potential decrease as early investors take profits.

Overall, CRSR has another quarter of showing a quickly growing company with a huge chunk of their market.  Bullish

This is my first DD so let's see how it goes!

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and these are my own opinions.

So, where to begin with $BB? We have seen the rise and fall of so-called, ""meme stocks"" to which $BB was grouped in with. Shortly thereafter, we saw some of them drop off ($BB, $NOK, etc.) while the focus remained on $GME and $AMC.

I am writing this because I, personally, believe in a huge rebound for $BB because they are the forefront of modern technology when it comes to autonomous vehicular design. In the article below we see that $BB's QNX technology is being utilized with Motional's autonomous vehicle design. This is as of Feb 9, 2021 (TODAY!)

[https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberrys-qnx-black-channel-communications-to-be-used-in-motionals-driverless-platform](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberrys-qnx-black-channel-communications-to-be-used-in-motionals-driverless-platform)

Here we see, ""[BlackBerry Limited](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en) (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) today announced an expansion of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX® Neutrino® Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.).""

For those of you who don't know, BAIDU is a Chinese multi-national corporation valued at over 573 Billion dollars. This is HUGE news.

As if that wasn't enough, they also mentioned in Dec of 2020 a partnership with AWS to utilize their software to accelerate their innovation with new intelligent vehicle data platform.

[https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform)

I find this all super promising as it appears that $BB has drawn away from the idea of phones and has started investing time and resources in their software for the future of society which in my opinion is autonomous vehicles.

Whether this is short or a long term play, I LIKE THE STOCK!

Look at this pretty picture. It's got a gold heading because it's about to *print.*

Sony's most recent Game Developer acquisition is *insomniac games*  which includes spider man, Ratchet and Clank ❤️, Spyro ect ect.

&#x200B;

Sony's Aim is to get everyone on their ecosystem, and once that happens they win the game. In a year that price to earnings could decrease due to the increase in their earnings, at which point they will become severely undervalued.

&#x200B;

PS5s are being sold at a loss, because the game is in the ecosystem now. Once people are locked in, they start printing cash boys. What am I saying, they are already printing cash.

Here some notes for the real nerds:

Sony's biggest segment (in revenue) - Game and network services. which include PlayStation consoles and Software sales (games). Operating magin around 12%

Next biggest in terms of revenue is their financial services. Operating margin of around 13% and growing steadily for the past 6 years.

Semiconductors - Swings wildy, actually only 11% of total revenue but has done well on the back of the semiconductor shortage.

Music - Sony signs hugely popular artists, operating margin at a solid 17% average. 

Pictures - Sony pictures is huge, and owns really popular brands, but only comprises of 8% of the companies operating income. Operating margin a rough 3%.

I will keep this post really simple. Canopy is a weed company in Canada that has lost money for the past 2 years after being semi-acquired by their parent company Constellation Brands. **Canopy is worth 17 billion dollars despite never producing a profit.**

Canopy has burned 1 billion dollars of direct cash burn over the past year and invested roughly another 1 billion in United States and Canadian businesses. These investments have amount to 1.9 goodwill and a horrible cash position at 673m.

&#x200B;

[Sept 30th](https://preview.redd.it/nwnon28ungg61.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4cbe3bd3bae43ca3b36673ace4e81af09cff3a1)

Canopy reported earnings today and stated that they have 1.5B in cash and cash equivalents, a loss of .39 billion (hilarious wording or $390 million) at the end of the quarter today. They have not uploaded their current balance sheet to SEDAR.

So they either have less investments or spent another 170 million in direct cash. Putting us at around 500 million in direct cash.

Hidden in today's earnings/press release -

*As additional consideration for the assets being transferred and the termination of the royalty agreement, Canopy Growth will make a cash payment to CRC of $115 million and issue an aggregate of 3,750,000 commons shares to CRC.*

Canopy will need to spend another 115 million and dilute shareholders to divest from another horrible Canadian business they acquired back in 2018 or whatever. This will hit the books next Q as Canopy Rivers has to vote/agree to that consolidation of capital.

From there, we have $500 million - $115 from this settlement = $375 million in direct cash after this transaction set up for next quarter, and projected cash burn from operations at another $100 million. **To be fair, the CEO has been cutting costs and it is all over the press releases about their efforts.**

Either way, they are at to be fair $275 million in direct cash and 1.2 billion in investments going into next quarter. **They are going to have to raise capital.**

\----

Topic change, well Canopy is in a growth sector. Sales must be booming in Canada, with a population of 35 million people! Yea well, they were. In November, it actually started to decline.

&#x200B;

Okay, so what about Constellation helping out Canopy. Well If you look at the actual agreement, Constellation extended the payment tranche out to November 2023. So they hold the option to deliver 5 billion dollars to Canopy by November 2023. That's amazing flexibility for Canopy, right?! Yea you would think so, but the reason it was extended is directly related to Constellation's balance sheet right now.

Constellation's last Q:

&#x200B;

[They have 152 million on the books right now. ](https://preview.redd.it/bckpgtjmqgg61.png?width=2161&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a06aac3dff38aa251ec2adaf74b82debfb8a92a)

Now, no one is doubting Constellation's ability to raise cash. They have immense liquidity, but if you actually look at their balance sheet. They have 10 billion in debt. They can either provide shares to Canopy and royally fuck over current STZ shareholders, or take on debt to provide it. **The deal is going to get restructured.** They will never provide 5 BILLION dollars to a company that can turn a profit.

Options Chain:

There's my position. I am all in bitches. Weed cannot go up forever. The company is worth 17 billion dollars. STZ is not going to provide 5 billion dollars to a company that already accumulated 1.9 billion in goodwill, will need more cash to fund US legalization, and cannot even turn a profit.

Let the puts fly.

So stop gnawing on your crayons for a second and pay attention.

First off, quick summary for people who can read an 8-K. If you only understand 🚀🚀🚀 , don't worry, I explain it in more detail with more emojis.

**TL;DR:** PTON just finalized sales of convertible notes and they're using $71M from the proceeds to buy call options on themselves to negate any dilutionary effects. They state in their 8-K  that the option counterparty is going to be buying PTON stock IMMEDIATELY to hedge risk. However you cut it, that's likely 300k-1M+ shares that need to be bought this week.

[https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-interactive-inc-announces-pricing-upsized-offering-8750](https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-interactive-inc-announces-pricing-upsized-offering-8750)

## The Play

If that was gibberish, I'll try to spell it out. PTON just sold $1B of convertible notes to wall street.

***What are convertible notes?***

Convertible notes are a type of debt, but instead of just offering to repay the debtor with cash, you give them the option of converting their loan to newly issued shares at a price established before hand. You could also think of it as a call option but, if it's out of the money at expiration, you can get your premium back, and if it's in the money you can ask the company to issue new shares for you.

***What's a call option?***

GTFO

***But wait, isn't creating new shares bad? Wouldn't that dilute the stock?***

Congrats on following along, normally yes. Normally shareholders react negatively to announcements of convertible notes. But PTON is simultaneously buying call options that will accrue value if their common stock gains enough value for the notes to be ""in the money"".

***What's the ""strike price"" for PTON's convertible notes?***

This is called the conversion price. The notes are only worth more than their face value if PTON closes above **$240/share**. 🚀 That's 65% upside from today.

***How big is the loan?***

PTON initially offered $600M of notes with the option to purchase an additional $90M. Clearly there was so much interest in that they expanded it to $875M with the option to purchase an additional $125M.

***Is there an expiration date?***

Neither party can do anything before 2024, between 2024 and 2026 investors can convert their notes.

***What's the interest rate?***

Get this, it's **0% interest**.

Let me repeat all that, as it's insane. **The debtors agreed to let PTON owe them $1B for 4-6 years at 0% interest, in exchange for the privilege of converting their investment into PTON shares at $240/share in 4 years.**

Meaning who ever is making this loan not only thinks PTON shares are going to be worth AT LEAST $240 in 4 years, but above $240 enough that this will beat inflation and any other safer investment they could make with that money.

***What's the significance of PTON using call options?***

They state in their 8-K that **they expect the option counterparty (the seller of the call options) to purchase PTON common stock to hedge their position, concurrently or immediately after pricing**. Pricing was finalized this morning. This will happen this week. In order to reach a delta neutral position the option counterparty has to purchase a lot of shares. How many, I don't know, depends on the delta of the spreads, but since they're buying $70M in call spreads that are $116 wide, I assume anywhere between $50M of shares to something like $150M. That's about \~300k-1M shares. That's a big chunk of the average volume however you cut it.

🚀🚀🚀🚀

**How to play this?**

🚀🚀🚀🚀

Buy call options and shares. I am personally going with 6/18 $160c. I will likely roll these 30 to 60 days to expiration as I see PTON as a long term play. You can choose something closer to expiration.

Caveat, the short term play may not work out. If you buy FDs you might lose your money. The counterparty may do an OTC transaction that gets reported at a later date. I don't really know how any of that works, and you're reading a non-professional's analysis.

If you buy longer expiration options or shares, even if the price doesn't go up this week, it will go up eventually.

## LONG TERM BULLISH STUFF

This is going to be a subjective argument. As a general piece of advice, reading random laypeople's number crunching on the internet is not going to serve you well. I'm being honest with you that I've neither put in the work nor am I qualified to be estimating future earnings or giving you a price target.

That being said, I have some financial advice for you: PTON is going to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀 🌝🌕 and you should take a bullish position if you like money.

Yes, I've read all the bearish crap about their financials. The thing is, companies look risky until they don't. I think this one will break out. Clearly lots of wall street institutions think so as well.

## Fundamentals

***Institutional ownership?***

70%. Wall Street is bullish af on this. 🚀🚀🚀

***Why would someone buy a $1500 exercise bike with an ipad?***

I mean this in a non-judgemental and nice way but if you don't understand why someone would purchase a $1500 exercise bike, you are probably poor.

PTON really is the first luxury product in this category. They really succeeded in making the product aspirational. People *want* to own this bike. There is a certain Apple like feel to it. It's a class signifier. It says something about the owner. It looks pretty. You can display it in your living room if you want.

It's cheaper than an Equinox membership. Yes you could go to planet fitness for cheaper but you could also drink ketchup for dinner.

If you have the money, it doesn't make sense to skimp too much on exercise equipment. If you're gonna hate your janky bike from AliExpress, you won't use it.

PTON keeps reporting quarter after quarter that **they are supply limited:** they're selling these bikes as fast as they can be made. This is flying off the shelves like Teslas.

Their subscription plan has the lowest rates of churn in the industry.

***End of the pandemic?***

Your view of the pandemic is short-sighted. The changes in the economy are not temporary, the pandemic really accelerated trends that were already there. I don't expect people to go back to gyms. Lots of people bought exercise equipment during this period, including myself. I hate gyms so much. People stare at you, it's far away, you have to change in public like it's high school.

The experience of hopping on your bike and joining a spin class or doing your own routine is 1000x better. I have become evangelical about how great owning a home spin bike is. Gyms lied to you with their stupid machines, whatever they have at gyms is easily replicated with a yoga mat, a set of  dumbbells and an exercise bike. That's really all your gym needs. Gyms were a flawed concept that relied on making cancellation difficult and making you feel bad about it.

***Positions***

6/19 160c 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Shares 🚀🚀🚀🚀

**tl:dr;** Some options writer has to buy a million PTON shares this week, maybe. Also long term PTON is the future of exercise and it's going to the moon.

**Disclaimer**; I am long PTON. I will gain money if this goes to the moon.

**EDIT:** Please don't downvote people who share bearish views in a polite and reasonable way. It doesn't help anyone to suppress opposing view points. Pic for the thumbnail:

Entire automative factories have been shut-down due to constraints on on getting chips in their vehicles. This phenomenon was predicted to be less unrelenting, but recently, many manufacturers (particularly Microsoft regarding the Xbox Series X) have basically admitted that they simply can’t sell their products due to the limits on chips designer’s limits of wafers of a given process node.

As a rundown, Intel, TSMC are the “big fabs” that you hear about in advanced computing technology. AMD uses TSMC, but AMD is on a 4-front battle with its console, desktop CPU, server CPU, and GPU market, as well as mobile chips. Essentially, any company in the position of AMD (even Intel and Nvidia are facing this problem) that can sell its products like hotcakes, but can’t get the nodes they need for their top-of-the-line products is bound by what they ordered months or years in advance. It is very likely that this will resonate as a prime reason to use lesser-utilized nodes by other companies for various other components (Internet-of-things, 5G etc...)

Essentially, chip *designers* are being constrained by their ability to gain access to various chips. But the fabs behind these “big-name” computing technology companies that you’re used to hearing about are essentially bidding with eachother for these same advanced process nodes, kicking smaller (and by *smaller* I don’t mean *small*, I mean literally anyone that isn’t trying to +1 extremely advanced computing products).

TSMC is producing process nodes that perform very well. Except, their supply is very limited. Keep in mind, Chip *designers* will often times outsource their designs to be made on different nodes. Intel uses TSMC, even though it has its own fabs, for instance. And Intel also rents out their own fabs.

This is where $UMC and various other lesser-known semi-conductor manufacturers come in. They will likely fill the massive demand for *any* process node that chip designers can get their hands on to fill the unprecedented shortages which seem to be pushed back farther and farther.

Eventually, your average, run-of-the-mill devices will need chips in them, and they are likely to have difficulties working with more well-renowned chip-makers to actually put their architectures on a given node. In general, chip-manufacturers have had the lion’s share of consistent performance over the past year due to increasingly innovative products from high-profile designers. It’s quite possible many device-manufacturers will opt not to use larger semi-conductor fabs as big-names like AMD, NVidia, and even Apple are competing for the same nodes.

At the very least, a lot of the previous success of semi-conductor manufacturers and chip designers may potentially trickle down to lesser-utilized and less glamorous fabs.

There’s already a precedent that very specialized chip designs will often go to these manufacturers, and now that the big names literally are fighting for these advanced nodes, many chipmakers have used Global Foundries and other “less sexy” fabs to meet demand for chips that they *need* now.

In general, companies with semiconductor fabs are likely to do well, simply due to the fact that the world in general needs more wafers, substrates etc... as infrastructure becomes more complex, digitally.

I recommend researching semi-conductor manufacturers who have long been underdogs.

EDIT: [semi-wiki](https://semiwiki.com/) has very in-depth descriptions of various companies, many of which you’re familiar with.

Made it last night but other than a collab between CGC and APHA, news about the merger seems to be the same this morning.

This is my first DD so please bare with me in case I set something up wrong; I'm happy to edit if so but this took me a while to gather.

I just joined this sub about two weeks ago amidst the GME hype. I've been investing for a few years now ever since the Tilray IPO at $17. Bought, sold, and reinvested consistently (pulling out my principal each time) right up through the almost $300 peak and backed out. I left Tilray alone for a while until recently when the news regarding the merger with Aphria started popping up because I actually love Aphria and I've owned it for a while now, so I wanted to post some DD regarding the merger. Hope this helps some of you.

**For the business:** Reverse merger is taking place where Aphria is absorbing Tilray and will own 63% of the company, continuing to use the name Tilray due to better brand recognition and its nearly eponymous representation of the cannabis market. Aphria has a strong presence in Germany which is the only European country with medical marijuana, so Aphria has an advantage in that sector for if/when other European nations start following suit. With both Aphria's and Tilray's international relations along with slowly migrating into the US they may grow into the largest cannabis company worldwide just in terms of revenue.

Over the previous 12 months, Aphria put up $443 million USD in revenue compared to Canopy Growth's $377m USD. Tilray has put up $201m USD in the last 12 months, and which combined with Aphria is $644m USD, or markedly higher than the $377m USD posted by the ""industry standard,"" Canopy Growth. (I don't hate on Canopy as a company whatsoever I just think they're overvalued and their stock should not be in the $40s).

Stats from the merger indicated a $685 million annual revenue, adjusted for combined sales, and the company itself, named Tilray, will have a roughly $3.5 billion valuation.

Also, many forget that Tilray has a business partnership with Anheuser-Busch and Aphria owns the craft beer company SweetWater. (Which, personally, is fucking delicious.)

**For the shareholder:** Each Aphria share will convert to 0.8381 shares of Tilray. As of today (Monday, 02/08/21) the closing price of Tilray was $30.09 and the price of Aphria was $18.98. In accordance to the **1 : .8381** conversion rate, the implied price of Aphria is $25.22, which has a 33% upside compared to the current share price.

I don't know the current borrowing rates (if anyone does please feel free to comment), but in January of 2019 the shorting cost for Tilray was above 900% and has been known to remain very high on this stock, as after it's $300 rally a couple years ago it became a favorite among the shorts. There is a way in which to capitalize on the merger by being long on Aphria and short Tilray, but the 30% profit may be outweighed by the crazy high costs of borrowing.

The two biggest risks appear to be the possibility that Aphria shares will crash days before the merger, or that that Tilray has simply been overvalued this entire time and its share price will fall. (*The strategy is listed in the sources here* [*https://seekingalpha.com/article/4404265-tilray-aphria-30-merger-arbitrage-is-tough-to-play*](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4404265-tilray-aphria-30-merger-arbitrage-is-tough-to-play) *& here* [*https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401101-aphria-and-tilray-option-strategy-enhances-returns-and-mitigates-losses*](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401101-aphria-and-tilray-option-strategy-enhances-returns-and-mitigates-losses) *but you can only open the articles once without a subscription*

**For everyone:** The general consensus on both stocks is bullish, however, more focus is placed on buying into Tilray than Aphria, seemingly just due to the belief that people may jump ship days before Aphria shares are converted into Tilray (even though Aphria still owns the operation). The company will also have easy access into the United States as our president restructures drug scheduling, so moving forward, I feel that Tilray is going to be a strong global competitor in the cannabis industry for some time

I try not to go balls deep on anything that has a lot of hype on it, but Tilray made me BANK right when I first started investing a few months before Canada legalized so I may be biased. However, as objectively as I can be, I do think this merger is both a very strong short and long option.

I don't really know if it's a necessary disclaimer or a joke but I'm gonna go ahead and say no, none of this is financial advice.

**My positions:** 100 APHA @ $11.13,  2 TSLA @ $408.66,  3 GME @ $165,  10 AMC @ $17.04,  100 SNDL @ $1.13,  100 22 RIGL @ $4.40

Edit 2:  Added the following list below of supporting info for legalizing marijuana nationwide.

A trio of U.S. senators has given investors the green light to invest in  marijuana stocks, an endorsement that suggests the volatile sector might finally  blossom into something as acceptable and regulated as alcohol.

More details will emerge when Sens. Cory Booker (D., N.J.),  Ron Wyden, (D., Ore.), and Chuck Schumer (D.,  N.Y.) introduce legislation to legalize and tax marijuana.

""In the early part of this year, we will release a unified discussion draft  on comprehensive reform to ensure restorative justice, protect public health and  implement responsible taxes and regulations,"" they announced Feb.  1 in a joint statement.

The marijuana sector has, naturally, advanced higher. The sector proxy, the  ETFMG Alternative Harvest exchange- traded fund , has seemingly entered a new,  higher trading range. The ETF holds 35 stocks, including Aphria(APHA) , Canopy Growth(CGC) , and GW Pharmaceuticals(GWPH) . The fund has about  $1.4 billion under management, which makes it the largest ETF  that targets the global cannabis industry.

In anticipation of the pending legislation, and in an attempt to harness the  momentum of other investors, aggressive investors can consider buying ETFMG  Alternative Harvest. The ETF is trading near a record high, but an options  strategy can potentially reshape the price.

With the ETF at $27.82, investors can sell the March  $25 put option for $1.90 and buy the March  $29 call option for about $2.80. The ""risk  reversal"" -- selling a put and buying a call with a higher strike price but  similar expiration -- positions investors for agreeing to buy the ETF at  $25 and for participating in gains above $29.

If the ETF is at $35 at March expiration, the call is worth $6.

The trade's risk is predicated on the pending legislation. The trade obligates investors to buy the stock at $23, or to cover the put  or roll the position, if the stock price is below the strike price at  expiration. For that reason, only do this trade if you have the resources and  willingness to buy the ETF at a lower price and a belief in marijuana's pending  legalization. If something happens in Washington that derails marijuana legalization  efforts, the trade falls apart.

Still, the trade is a good way for investors to gain exposure to the  legalization of marijuana, which seems like a good bet as federal government  contends with massive deficits caused by the 2007-09 financial crisis and the  Covid-19 pandemic.

The ETF was chosen over component stocks to potentially reduce the investment  risk that is inherent in picking stocks in an unusual sector with companies that  have a history of extraordinary price volatility.

During the past 52 weeks, the ETF has ranged from $8.81 to  $27.90. The fund gained about 45% over the past year and is up  some 67% this year. The percentage returns seem stellar, but it is important to  remember that the fund has advanced off a low price, and that many of the  components weren't much better situated. The sector could be facing a critical  moment, and this trade puts investors into the center of the industry with a  strategy that can be reset as each month passes.

Being an IT person, their products are best in class and rock solid. They also sell routers & switches as well as a ticketing platform for IT departments/companies. When they first launched their IPO a few months ago, I bought some shares and have been following them since. Their network equipment reminds me of Cisco Meraki, just at the very beginning of their launch(I did the same w/ Ubiquiti $UI, and have rode it from $55 to $350/share).

They are about to release their 2nd earnings report on 3/11. This is where I found a pretty good options play. Share price is roughly $24.87-$25 right now, and the 3/19 call options at $22.50 is trading around $4. This means the stock only has to rise to $26.50 or $1.63 during their earnings report timeframe to win on this. Given this is their 2nd earnings release(their first one was right around their IPO, so it was pretty buried), if they have good news, this could be a big winner. I believe the $20 call options may have an even smaller gap to cross, likely closer to $25.75, or $1.10.

&#x200B;

The bonus is that their equipment is generally sold in contracts, so the likelihood of them having a poor quarter is minimal. I have bought call options and own shares. Not financial advice, I just like the stonk.

**TLDR: I believe DoorDash (DASH) is the greatest short opportunity of the year, and what’s more, rather than just having a general feeling, there are specific timetables enabling us to profit bigly. The company even admits themselves that they have peaked as a company.**    
    
# Analysis:
    
> “Food delivery with third-party apps like Grubhub and Uber Eats is booming, but no one's making money.” – Business Insider.    
    
DoorDash is wildly overvalued. This is true by any metric, were it in essentially any industry. Add to that its in food delivery, which is a horrific, no margin industry in what has become a commoditized business and offers essentially no differentiation with its competitors.  There is near zero differentiation between Uber Eats, Postmates, Caviar, Grubhub, DASH, or any local provider. In Austin we have Favor, for example. And nobody cares which company delivers their food, they only care which one does it cheapest.     
    
If you view stock (as you should) as buying the entire business as an owner, how much would you be willing to pay for an undifferentiated company in a no margin commoditized business that has peaked (see below for more on that)? Because it’s currently selling for an insane $56 billion. Outrageous.    
    
So how can we get a banana for scale to understand what that $56 billion means in terms of valuation?    
    
Well, all of DoorDash’s competitors have either sold at or are trading at, or raised money at, a capitalization of 3x to 6x sales. **DASH is trading at an absolutely insane 20+ x sales.**    
    
Just six months ago [Postmates was acquired for $2.65 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/uber-takes-out-postmates) which put it at 4x sales. **At 4x sales, DASH would trade at $32.**    
    
DASH used to be the business leader in this industry, but over the past 2-3 years Grubhub has exploded in size to take on nearly the same 33% of market share, and after Uber Eats bought Postmates, it too now has about a third of market share. So you now have three giants of roughly equal size battling it out in a business in which customers don’t give a motherloving frick about branding.    
    
### But don’t take my word for it on valuation, take smart money’s word    
    
[DoorDash raised money just a couple months ago at a $16 billion valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/after-ipo-delays-doordash-confirms-400m-raise/#:%7E:text=DoorDash%20has%20confirmed%20that%20it,money%20valuation%20of%20%2416%20billion). That is truly a stunning fact. In just a few months the WSB type day trading call buyers have bid this company all the way up to $56 billion from $16 billion without any material change to the business and completely ignoring the coming vaccine-induced reopening of restaurants. Again, the stock trades for a 300% markup to its recent smart money capital raise based on nothing but unfounded hopium.     
    
You don’t have to take my word for it, your beloved Jim Cramer has even said the same thing, in his own idiotic, covering my ass, round about say nothing way. “It’s true that people using market orders took DoorDash to levels that maybe ... were far higher than they thought they’d have paid.” - Jim Cramer    
    
I don’t care about his commentary, but you people seem to love him, so there you go. 😘      
    
## The Company, according to The Company, has peaked. It’s over.     
    
There are two extremely interesting things buried in the S-1 we’re going to get into in a moment. One of them is that you don’t have to take my word for it that this company’s business has peaked. **The company says so itself in its own S-1.**   
    
>“The circumstances that have accelerated the increase in Total Orders stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may not continue in the future, and we expect the growth rate in Total Orders to decline in future periods.”    
    
To put it simply, COVID numbers are falling, vaccines are rolling out at an impressive 1-2 million per day which puts our stated goal of 100 million vaccinated in 100 days within attainable reach. The economy will be opening up, people will want to be getting out of the house, restaurants will be reopening, and there will be huge pent up demand by people who have had extraordinarily high savings rates over the last year. Big chains will no longer have the need to get help from third party delivery apps at a 15% markup. We all know this is the case, and DoorDash even stated as much in its own filing. This stock is toast.    
    
 >“Delivery via smartphone is one of those venture-funded sectors where business executives appear to have taken seriously the old joke about “losing money on every transaction but making it up on volume.”” – New York Magazine    
    
[“DoorDash and Grubhub and Uber Eats... it’s a tough business for them. It’s very competitive. I think the business model is hard.” - Panera Bread CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzQJdBHo3tw).    
    
## And Now the Fun Part     
    
There are some wild share lockup expirations coming up. For those that don’t know, when you get these massive IPOs, insiders aren’t actually to sell their shares on IPO day. They are locked up and the insiders just have to hope for the best that the stock will not lose value over the comping months. If the stock skyrockets in value, but the insiders know the business is trash or has peaked, you get the perfect recipe for a rush for the exits.     
    
I love playing share lockups. I make a lot of money on them by selling spreads. A common question I get when I post them here is “if you know a drop is coming, why doesn’t the market just price it in?” The answer is because it can’t. No matter what the share price does, the lockup expiration date is the lockup expiration date. Insiders have to wait until that date, and it doesn’t matter whether the stock falls 0%, 5%, or 50%, they will all have to wait until that day to sell.     
    
DoorDash has two share lockup expirations coming.     
    
The first lockup expiration is an early release (heh) and hits 90 days after the Dec. 9 IPO, or around March 9, as long as the stock trades 25% higher than the IPO price for five out of 10 consecutive days of trading.  That is to say, so long as DASH trades above $127.50 right before March 9, the lockup is triggered. The good news for you with this insane run up in price is that if the lockup isn’t triggered, it means the stock has already fallen from $180 to $127. It’s important to know March 9 is not a hard date exactly...some insiders can be allowed to go a few days prior. Also if they release earnings early the lockup could potentially occur at the end of this month.    
    
I was talking to some folks on WSB about the lockup last week, and someone mentioned they thought only 20% of insider shares will be eligible. DoorDash's management and board members can sell up to 20% of their shares in that first wave, but other insiders can sell up to 40%. This means 113 million shares are eligible for sale in early lockup expiration. DoorDash’s daily volume is only 3-4 million shares. The current public float is roughly 123 million shares. This means you’re about to suddenly double the number of shares on the market.     
    
Door Dash’s second lock-up expiration hits either 180 days after its IPO, which means around June 9 (more or less), or after the release of its first-quarter earnings report (whichever is earlier), and will free up “all remaining shares” according to the S-1, which if my math is correct is roughly 50 million shares.     
    
These two expirations could spark violent sell-offs throughout the year.    
    
## Positions     
    
### FDs
        
I never buy FDs. I’ve never once bought them in my entire life. But I’m putting 1% of my portfolio into them on DASH because I’m confident big drops are coming. Unfortunately for you guys, the stock has already started falling this past month from its 🤡-level highs in the $200s, and worse yet the pricing/IV of all options has gotten more expensive. This means, I’m sorry to say, that you’re not going to find any options trading for pennies, or even anything less than $2. For your FDs, I recommend you buy puts at whatever the lowest strikes are that actually have any volume. The strikes go as low as $75, but most days show 0 volume and of course the bid/ask spread is enormous. There has been some volume at $95 recently, and you can get the $75s if you’re patient enough and willing to pay up for them. Expiration dates would be any time in mid to late March (again, looking for whatever has volume) so that it occurs after lockup 1, and the August 20s, which unfortunately are the closest expiration to the lockup occurring around June 9. I wish there was a closer expiration, but hey, more time for the stock to collapse. Plus you could always sell your puts after the June 9 drop with lots of theta meat still left on the bone.     
    
### Puts
I own March 12 $160 puts. I think the stock will drop healthily below this, but IV is high. I’m normally taking big swings with spreads, so when I buy puts outright, which is rare, I want to play it a little safer.    
    
I also own the August 20 $145 puts.     
    
And finally, I have six figure credit call spreads open at the $175 level. For newbies, this simply means I:    
Bought (yes bought) the March 12 $175 calls, and     
Sold the $172.50 calls.    
    
I went huge on these because all I need is for DoorDash to trade below $172.50 after the lockup expiration and I’ll be having a Merry Christmas. That’s as close to risk free gains as you’re ever going to see in your life.    
    
### Bull case    
The only bull case is that we’re in a raging, record-setting bull market and all stonks go up. The economy is opening back up, vaccines are rolling out, and stonks go up. But I think if you look at the DASH chart you can see that that is already starting to not be the case.    
    
### What are the negatives?    
I plagiarized liberally [from an old Citron Research report](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DoorDash-The-Most-Ridiculous-IPO.pdf), although it doesn’t even mention share lockups. Yes, that Citron. For those of you who are newer members, I will tell you this; the little smart money social circles in and around WSB do not hate CItron, Hindenburg, or any other short selling firms. We respect them and welcome bearish cases on high flying stocks. Any intelligent trader does. It’s only the pump and dumpers who have a hatred for short reports. You should welcome contrarian views.    
    
### Parting Words.   
I would welcome anyone pointing out where they think I may be wrong. I don’t care about saving face, I care about not losing money. If I’m wrong, I want to know it. I welcome constructive criticism.    

# Give Me One More TLDR At The End    
This stock is going to collapse because it’s wildly overvalued, employees got in super cheap with shares they are waiting to sell, know the business has peaked, and they want to cash the fahk out. So swallow the high IV and buy puts today as fast as you can.     
    
Love you guys."|2021-02-09 17:04:35.193857|../output/raw/2021/02/09/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170436.csv|DueDiligence|['I', 'I']|[]|['DASH', 'I', 'DASH', 'DASH', 'DASH', 'DASH', 'WSB', 'I', 'COVID', 'I', 'IPO', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'I', 'I', 'IPO', 'IPO', 'DASH', 'I', 'WSB', 'IPO', 'I', 'DASH', 'IV', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'IV', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'DASH', 'I', 'IPO', 'I', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'TLDR', 'IV']|[]

Verizon, Centurylink, AT&T, Frontier Communications

None have increased in price since 1999. Only Verizon is near its peak in 99; AT&T is half the price it was then. Centurylink is 1/5th the price. Frontier is 1/500th the price.

All of these companies have something in common: They all own Bell's old wireline assets. And they've done nothing with them. For the twenty five years or so they've held them.

These companies are, collectively, the biggest service providers for rural ""broadband"" (it's an oxymoron) in the United States. They are also all reporting dwindling landline subscribers year over year, due in large part to the poor service and poor price point for a service that no longer works as well as it once did, due to crumbling copper infrastructure and failed (and/or refusal to commit to) fiber replacement.

Verizon and AT&T have both offered very substantial dividends for years (and received hundreds of billions in taxpayer subsidy) as opposed to reinvesting those billions of dollars into necessary upgrades to infrastructure and maintenance. They have also reported consistent layoffs of technical personnel in every passing year. I suspect Centurylink and Frontier have reported the same. Great way to pad balance sheets in failing companies!

Now, Verizon and AT&T both own wireless systems; Verizon being the self-proclaimed 'largest nationwide provider.' But there's a problem here for both of them. T-Mobile is blowing them out of the water in urban areas with faster speeds and truly unlimited data, and in rural areas, where they have a stranglehold, the ROI is not very good. To make matters worse, competitors like Starlink, and later, OneWeb and Project Kuiper, are coming online and the telcos are not prepared to compete against them in their rural regions.

The fact that both AT&T and Verizon attempted (and more or less failed) to move into the media sphere with acquisitions over the years seems to imply they weren't very interested in staying telecommunications companies. In fact, I believe their goal, long term - and there are articles supporting this out there - was to let the old ATM/copper network rot completely, and become solely wireless companies. No more unlimited data landlines, no more telephone subscribers. That's a much bigger chunk of their current revenue than people may realize.

If these companies keep losing ground in urban areas, they will face insurmountable monetary challenges in the next decade due largely in part to their own hubris. They figured wireless would be the solution to everything, but as it turns out, if you don't run fiber to the farmland, wireless might as well be dial-up.

**tl;dr** The telcos are quickly running out of time and resources to make up for their mistakes over the last twenty years. If they don't act soon, it will be lights out."|2021-02-09 17:04:35.193857|../output/raw/2021/02/09/DueDiligence_flair_DD_170436.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['T', 'T', 'T', 'I', 'T', 'ROI', 'T', 'I']|[]

Using the US tickers. Holding 500 shares of APHA, not giving advice just putting out details.

Prices at time of writing:

* **TLRY** - 42.39

* **APHA** - 23.19


**Background:** Tilray (TLRY) and Aphria (APHA) are two companies based in Canada that sell marijuana. A few years ago both of these companies went to the moon, especially TLRY which reached $300 a share before crashing back down. 


**Current Catalysts**

*Merger:* Recently they announced a merger, set to finalize this year. The combined company will trade under the TLRY name and ticker, but APHA is acquiring TLRY. Those holding APHA will get ~0.84 shares of the new company (TLRY) for each APHA share they hold.

*Arbitrage gap:* Both companies have skyrocketed since announcing the merger, boosted by other news such as the Dem majority, Biden's election, and opening new deals in the UK. Oddly, TLRY has outpaced APHA, leading to a massive gap in share price. At the 0.84 share conversion APHA shares should be currently trading at $35.60. 

*Market share/Cap:* The combined TLRY/APHA will be the largest weedstock in the world by sales, with one of the highest margins as well. However, they are currently undervalued compared to CGC, the largest weedstock by market cap, by about 5 billion dollars, or ~50% of their current market cap. You may remember CGC was awarded a 5 billion dollar investment a few years back by Constellation Brands.

**Future Catalysts**

* Merger - Not finalized, but very likely to be finalized soon

* Partnership - Likely, as they will be the largest company and have the largest global footprint. Who the partner will be is unknown, but it is likely that they get one

* US Legalization - Dems could hold this up, but all signs point to reform coming

* US Banking reform - This will allow all sorts of money to flow into the sector that is current prohibited because marijuana is still illegal at the federal level

**Stupid Questions I keep seeing**

* No, this isn't like last time. When TLRY went to $300 it was shorted 33%. It is currently shorted 50% and has actual catalysts and sales behind it now

* The price looks different on Canadian tickers because they trade in Canadian dollars. It is still the same company

* If you own APHA, when the merger comes you will get 0.84 TLRY shares for each APHA share. It is that simple. If it isn't an even number you get some cash back. If you own calls, the calls will be bundles of 84 shares instead of 100. Seriously, this isn't hard math

* Yes they can still run, they are undervalued compared to CGC and the US market is bigger than Canada, UK, and Germany combined.

* Yes they can still drop. If I knew for certain it was going up I'd have more than 500 shares and be much less poor

* TLRY could drop to close the gap, or APHA could rise. No one knows which will happen. APHA is likely the safer play at this point, as it is cushioned by the gap in share price.

Today there is a very important report coming which will let us know updated numbers on the number of shorts that major hedge funds still have.

**This report will most likely be artificially skewed in an attempt to shake out the rest of the long-term SS holders.**

***How can the report be skewed?*** Say you have 1000 shares in short positions in a company that only has 1000 shares available. That means that your hedge fund has a 100% short interest in that company. Say, some random trove of wandering monkeys notice that your hedge fund has 100% short interest in that company, and you and your billionaire friends are all spooked because there aren't enough shares for those monkeys to buy (the short squeeze narrative). What do you do?

You somehow have to amass enough shares to drive that short interest percent down, because you want to appear that you've closed your short positions and scare the monkeys away. So this is what you do. You buy 800 shares in long positions (using call options), and suddenly the short interest is only 20%. You have made it appear that your hedge fund is no longer unreasonably short on that stonk.

&#x200B;

**HOWEVER, YOU HAVE STILL NOT CLOSED YOUR SHORT POSITION!** You still have to buy back all of those shorted stocks, and you've effectively thrown a rug over the giant shit stain in the middle of the room. It's worth it for you to do this though, because the monkeys who are expecting a moon will paper-hand and stop the short squeeze from being as severe.

&#x200B;

What does this mean? Hold, despite what the report says. If the report shows high SI, then the hedgies are actually 100% boned and have not even had enough time and/or money to offset that SI number. That's huge. If the report shows low SI, HODL. The big players simply have not had enough volume to cover all their short positions, and are trying to manipulate us into thinking the MOASS was a hoax.

Today $CRSR earnings released. The numbers were killer as they have been all year (I'm not going to dive into deep DD on the earnings report itself as other posts have already done),. Future guidance is conservative but still very bullish. 

This stock has everything going for it, yet the price tanked. 

**Why?**

Because its 2021 and every stock is doing the same thing post positive earnings. 

Check out [LOGI](https://imgur.com/D0FoKHV)....earnings call on 1/18, dipped for a day, bounced back to ATH 2 weeks later and climbing fast. 

CRSR is currently at the bottom of that curve right now.

Was it an IV crush? Honestly this morning it was more like a bunch of short-selling in expectations of an IV crush followed by a bunch of panicky paper hands.  It's already up 5% on the day's lows

Every $CRSR financial metric is extremely positive, huge gains over last year.

""But but but /u/dontmicrowavecats , are you sniffing glue? The price of CRSR already rose from $36 to $46, the earnings was already priced in. There will be no moon for you.""

No, wrong. Why? Because the price was only at $36 due to pressure from the GME squeeze.

**Citadel owns 2% of the $CRSR Float. On 1/13, the same day GME rose 57% for the first time, CRSR tanked. CRSR was oversold in direct reaction to GME**
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRSR/holders?p=CRSR

So the price tanks from $41ish to $36, starts recovering, then CRSR issues a secondary PO for 7.5 million shares...price drops again. 

The stock is currently BARELY trading above the previous averages right now. The entire ""runup"" to ER wasn't a runup at all, but rather an upward price correction to where it should be.

The stock is still undervalued, and currently trading at a big discount. Today and *possibly* tomorrow will be the best day to buy CRSR you will get.

We are likely going to see $60 within 2 weeks, $70+ soon after that.

A potential shill erased all his posts regarding negative sentiment on $GME earlier. I asked him why he had deleted his posts. He hit me with he did not.

This is an obvious attempt at gaslighting, which is a form of unethical manipulation.

Please, be vigilant out there, apes.

A very easy way to spot shills is by looking at their submission history.

Bot accounts or people making accounts to sell will go into subreddits that allow karma farming like WSB and /r/FreeKarma4U delete those posts and act like it's because ""they scrub their history"". Fuck off.

WKHS is it all time highs, and Reddit loves to pump the stock. Me? I was one of the biggest workhorse bulls with hundreds of shares in my portfolio. I rode the wave until today, where I sold the last of my shares. So... why?

Well, **90% of this company‘s value is based on them getting the USPS deal. People love to think the company is a shoe in for the USPS deal, but that’s simply not the case.**

For starters, the Biden administration doesn’t have nearly as much control over the United States Postal Service as you think. See: https://twitter.com/bradplumer/status/1354831900939079680?s=20
Even if Biden‘s number one goal was for the USPS to go all electric, he’d have to move hell and earth to have any control over that happening. And, with the contract supposedly being decided by the end of March, there simply isn’t enough time to do that.

But it gets even worse. People say “well, workhorse is the only all electric option, so at least it has that going for it.“ To that, I Bring you a conversation an analyst had with Oshkosh:

> “Your bid is based on the Ford's transit, I believe. And we just heard the announcement of the new Ford e-transit coming out here in 2021. For your comment that you can address whatever the USPS' needs are as far as powertrain, is it as simple as just substituting the transit for the e-transit? Or do you have to have a special reopening of the contract and new approval to kind of make that switch?”

Oshkosh’s reply: 

> “So there's limited things that I can say about this program, not because I don't want to, but because we're under a pretty tight confidentiality with the USPS. We don't have to reopen anything to address the needs as they evolve with the contract. I really can't comment on the transit van because of the confidentiality. But I can say that we don't need to go back and have some arduous task of reopening an agreement if the contract goes one way or another, we will not have to do that.”

In other words, Oshkosh theoretically has no issue with amending their bid for the contract into a bid including all-electric vehicles. Oshkosh, with their powerful connection with Ford, has all the resources they need to win this contract, and their long track record as a successful company protects their stock from plummeting. Workhorse, on the other hand, is a fledgling company with no infrastructure to build a large number of vehicles and a product that is not particularly unique or special.

Let’s get to the point: the contract will either be decided by end of March or be delayed once again. Either way, WKHS will likely plummet (like it did the last time the contract was delayed). **Buy mountains of WKHS puts expiring in April. Buy OSK shares or, if you’re brave like me, calls expiring in April.**
