[Top 15 Options Activity from Friday \(1\/29\/2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/50atl3uc1pe61.png?width=1373&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e0b4faeda15be0c6e6cf70d0dff3a1bd9d01b0a)

Due to the exponential increase in membership in WSB I have started to see a lot of misinformation, favoritism, and overall divisiveness going on within the community. I decided to do my own Due Diligence (DD) to determine which stocks I will be holding next week, and hopefully this can start up a meaningful conversation in the comment section to help out our new friends who mostly want to know what to invest in.  I pulled the top 15 stocks with the greatest Options Volume from Friday (1/29). You can see all 4 of the $BANG stocks make this list. Despite understanding that GME is a heavily shorted stock with a Short Float greater than 100%, it is important to look at the Put Volume as well. This is the numbers of option contracts that are shorting the stock. GameStop is the only company of the batch that has a Short Float of greater than 100%, which is why this short squeeze is working so well, but it’s also the most heavily shorted on the options side. I think it’s important to see all 4 of the BANG stocks are heavily shorted on the put side too. If you look up who is buying these Put Contracts, it is mostly big institutional investors, whose best interest is to artificially depress the stock price so their puts pay out (look at what happened to BB and NOK on Thursday and Friday). This is why we have to stand together as a community and embrace the $BANG index that we created.

**GME** \- This is a short squeeze. Not much to say here. Buy, hold, don’t sell.

**BB** \- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. 66% of the float (shares available) are owned by institutional investors, so while the float might seem big (550M), we are only dealing with 34% of the shares. Buy, hold, don’t sell.

**AMC** \- Also a short squeeze. The Short float isn’t above 100% but this is still a great potential candidate.

**NOK** \- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. This is the weirdest one to me because everyone was claiming this was “bot” propaganda last week and then has the 3rd highest option volume on Friday. Not sure how to feel about this one, but hey its popular.

**Defining some terms:**

**Short Float:** Percentage of shorted shares in relation to the total number of floated shares (shares available to be traded)

**Options Volume:** Total number of **option** contracts bought and sold for the day

**% Put:** Percentage of total option contracts that are puts (think the stock will go down)

**% Call:** Percentage of total option contracts that are calls (think the stock will go up)

**Put/Call Ratio:** Ratio of puts to calls option contracts (higher the ratio, higher the short %)

I had my first 6 figure day in the market on Friday when NVAX went from 134 to 235 overnight after reporting great efficacy data. My weeklies were up 9000%, it was incredible. I want to send a thank you to u/Upstairs_Speech for his posts in the past, I would not have thought of the trade if it was not for him.

Now before you all tell me ""I wish I saw this before the stock went up 70%"" let me explain to you why this is still early innings. Sure, this might not be as sexy of a trade as round 1 was, but now that data concerns are off the table this thesis has a lot less risk. This one is more of a low risk, high growth play as opposed to a get rich quick one.

Let's do a mental exercise:

The day is December 31, 2020, everyone is excited to be moving on to 2021. NVAX share price hovers at $110, a $7B market cap awaiting UK phase 3 efficacy data. There are real concerns as to whether NVAX actually has a vaccine that works given their prior 30 years of failures. The market prices this risk accordingly and NVAX's market cap is only **17%** that of MRNA.

Fast forward 4 weeks. NVAX has released data on 20,000 patients, shows the highest efficacy of any vaccine against wild type COVID. NVAX shows strong efficacy against UK strain which no one else has. They show that the South Africa strain is a real concern with efficacy at 60%, and there is 0 reason to believe any vaccine will perform better against that strain. 

And I can't overstate this part enough, the **really** important detail here is that NVAX is the only protein vaccine on the horizon. The only other protein vaccine coming any time soon is MAYBE GSK/Sanofi and they already showed terrible data. They blamed it on dosing but there are major question marks there and they are delayed 6 months minimum. The reason protein vaccines are important is because they are the only ones that can offer coverage against multiple strains in a single shot. This is how the flu shot is done (which NVAX just passed phase 3 of in March). The flu shot is a protein vaccine that covers 4 strains in a single shot. What is becoming very clear is that we are going to need the same for COVID. The future of COVID vaccines is that in your annual shot you get coverage against wild type, SA strain and Brazil strain for example. NVAX is the **only** company that can do this right now. RNA vaccines are too reactive to handle multiple strains. You can already see how many symptoms people get with the current vaccine.

This [thread](https://twitter.com/PeterKolchinsky/status/1354929042965864451?s=20) is gold and helped me to understand the situation.

The market clearly has not digested this sufficiently yet. How do I know? Let's go back to the exercise from the beginning. Given NVAX's advancements in the last 4 weeks their market cap has doubled, up to 14B. What do you think Moderna has done in that same time frame when their COVID platform continues to weaken? Up 5%? 10%? 20%? They are up 67% in that same time frame! After everything that has happened NVAX still only has **20%** the market cap of MRNA. It basically hasn't even caught up. The reporting from mainstream media on NVAX was an abomination, especially compared to how they covered J&J's bad data. The truth will emerge. The market will realize it and will see NVAX is still deeply undervalued.

I am obviously not saying that NVAX will inevitably be as valuable or more valuable than MRNA. MRNA technology is very valuable and they are an extremely ambitious company. BUT, NVAX is about to play catch up due to the glaring discrepancy. In addition to COVID don't forget that NVAX has an incredible flu shot, likely at some point to be the first RSV vaccine ever and their Matrix M adjuvant is now very valuable. Quick recap of differences between the two vaccines:

My belief is that NVAX gets to a 20B market cap very soon (50% upside) and I can't imagine a world in which its not at 30B minimum by year end (100% upside). Upcoming catalysts are finalizing 200M dose deal with EU, emergency use authorization in the UK and other countries will quickly follow, production partnership with Merck or GSK/Sanofi and others.

IMO this week will be very telling, if it is up on Monday buy and don't think twice. If it pulls back maybe give it a couple days to get a better price on options as it might consolidate for a while.

**Positions:**

75% allocated to 1/21/22 280 calls. If it gets to 30B market cap by expiration its over a 300% return and I think market cap gets there by end of summer so it would be even more profitable. Don't mess with the July calls at this point, they are too expensive. You basically get the same value and more time going with next January. IMO this one is free money.

25% allocated to 4/16/21 240 calls. If it gets to 20B market cap by expiration this is a 150% return. I think there is a somewhat decent chance it could be there by the end of this week but we will see."|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|['NVAX']|['NVAX']|['I', 'I', 'NVAX', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'NVAX', 'B', 'UK', 'NVAX', 'MRNA', 'NVAX', 'COVID', 'NVAX', 'UK', 'I', 'NVAX', 'MAYBE', 'NVAX', 'COVID', 'COVID', 'SA', 'NVAX', 'RNA', 'I', 'B', 'COVID', 'NVAX', 'MRNA', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'I', 'NVAX', 'MRNA', 'MRNA', 'BUT', 'NVAX', 'COVID', 'NVAX', 'RSV', 'M', 'NVAX', 'B', 'I', 'B', 'M', 'EU', 'UK', 'IMO', 'B', 'I', 'IMO', 'B', 'I']|['NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX']

I am a fucking retard so my math is probably wrong, but if its not it proves that $DB is MASSIVELY overvalued and presents an enormous short opportunity for retail investors like ourselves. Also, it just happens to screw over one of the most evil and corrupt banks in the United States, if not the world. (They also have more than 300B in Debt)

Overshadowed by the recent infinite money glitch known as $GME and $AMC, $DB experienced THREE gigantic scandals in one week.

1. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-regulators-press-deutsche-bank-090221050.html?.tsrc=rss](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-regulators-press-deutsche-bank-090221050.html?.tsrc=rss)

Now that we are aware of the fraudulent and scammy work conducted by these assholes, lets analyze their share price.

**Current Share Price:** 10.12

**Historical (12 Month) Earnings Per Share:** \-0.89 (0.1 Q3 2020)

**Annual Sales:** 28.9B

**Annual Dividend per Share:** 0.10

**Historical Price/Earnings (Median):** 16.70

**Book Value Per Share:** 0.2939

([https://smallbusiness.chron.com/calculate-companys-stock-price-21802.html](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/calculate-companys-stock-price-21802.html))

I used two of the formulas presented in the above article Benjamin Graham & P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)

1. Projected Price using Benjamin Graham Formula

1a. SQR ((15)(1.5)(.1)(0.2939)) = 0.81 (actual value per share)

2. P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)

2a. ((16.70)(0.1)) = 1.67 (intrinsic value)

&#x200B;

This means the actual *value* of the stock is *Drumroll Please...*

Between  $0.81 - $1.67

&#x200B;

If my math is correct (and it probably isn't), then this means that Deutsche Bank's stock is MASSIVELY overvalued and is due for a market correction (hence the AMAZING shorting opportunity). Also, if I am wrong please correct me - I only would like to learn more about the market, so I can eventually lose $5,000,000 in an earnings call.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Current Price = 10.12

&#x200B;

I do not want to mess up the momentum of $GME or $AMC, I am only posting this because in the same way that we LIKE those stocks, I think we should also be open to DISLIKING some of the worst stocks on the market. Especially stocks with ties to CNBC and the other hedge fund assholes who have enslaved us with debt.

&#x200B;

\*Full Disclosure: I do not have access to margin with my brokerage therefore limiting my ability to make this trade. I also lack the capital to do so. This post is not intended to be financial advice, rather an analysis of current market conditions.\*

40 shares of some crappy penny stock (Frontier Comm.) @ $0.24

I just got off a conference call with all your wives' boyfriends and I got some DD to drop on you. Everyone here knows about the big four stocks right now. If not, GTFO.

What I’m here to tell is to not focus 100% on these four and let other great opportunities pass you by. (Note – What I am NOT TELLING YOU is to sell your GME. Hodor that sh\*t). While you all have been foaming at he mouth over your GME games, you’ve likely missed what is going on with the rest of the market. Several great performing stocks have been dumping since this GME craze began. Oh, need examples?  To name a few you may have heard of: 

AAPL – Down 5.11% 

AMD – Down 7.7% 

BIDU – Down 7%

DOCU – Down 8.7%

F – Down 8.6%

PINS – Down 6.25%

NIO - down 8%

Wondering why this may be? Two theories They both might be right, or I might have a really smooth brain. 

1) These hedge funds everyone here is so keen on financially ruining need to cover their losses somehow. What better way than to liquidate stocks that have had crazy runs the last few months.  If this is true it will be extra enjoyable to watch them pay more to re-enter these positions when the stocks inevitably bounce back.

2) You people selling your shares in other stuff to buy more GME. (again, great job holding the line) I have seen several posts on here from other smooth brains selling their shares of some of those listed here. I applaud your enthusiasm for the cause and wish you the best. 

With these two combined, you end up with tons of shares dumping from these 401K stocks, with the buyers foaming at the mouth for more GME, NOK, AMC, BB. 

Once this is all over and the world of normies forget all about the GME madness, they are going to put their money back into their boomer stocks and standard 401K stocks. What does this mean for you? Don’t miss the dips happening all around you while the world is focused on 4 stocks and a shiba inu. If you have any extra money and cant afford GME, check out the rest of the market for buying opportunities. 

TLDR – Keep holding the line! If you have any money left, buy the dips on others for bonus tendies

See how retarded you are?? Everyone else is also just as retarded if not more. Most opinions you read and news you hear and rumors about anything are wrong, and genuinely dumb or ill thought out. I too may very well be retarded. 

Most of the takes on Robinhood are wrong. It’s a traffic jam. The same guard rails that are supposed to protect the plumbing of the system in an off ramp on the left side of the chart are slowing the system in the on ramp on the right side of the chart. You just can't open up millions of margin accounts a day trading stocks that move 300% a day. Even the most liquid brokerage quickly becomes very illiquid holding all the liable accounts. By Tuesday they will have enough liquidity and shares will have settled and retail will be able to buy en masse. Robinhood is the #1 app in the WORLD right now. This is only going to accelerate. They will get the plumbing right and add lines of credit. Credit markets are fine, so Robinhood can access capital. To the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀 

In addition, all the folks transferring accounts OUT of Robinhood cannot sell. It can take 3-5 days for a journal to clear. That is forced 💎🙌, which reduces the tradeable float of GameStop, increasing the short interest as a percentage of the float. 

We will see more buying pressure this week, forced holding by transfers, more institutional buying, and algorithms from quant funds like Renaissance Technologies analyzing everyone’s autistic thoughts, and following!!

**Breakdown of Restrictions by Brokerage: Worst to Best**

**RobinHood: (Worst)**

\- Trading restrictions limiting purchasing power to as little as 1-5 shares on over 50 stocks

[https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys)

\- Allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of GME and AMC during Thursday's trading rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\- Liquidity issues: RH is racing to raise 1$ billion from its existing investors as of Friday as many individuals are withdrawing their funds in protest of restrictions

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

**Interactive Brokers (garbage)**

\- Trading restrictions on GME/AMC/BB allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of these securities during Thursdays trading Rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\- CEO stated in CNBC interview they imposed restrictions to help out hedge funds (and stabilize the market)

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

[https://www.investopedia.com/robinhood-latest-broker-to-restrict-trading-of-gamestop-and-others-5100879](https://www.investopedia.com/robinhood-latest-broker-to-restrict-trading-of-gamestop-and-others-5100879)

**WeBull + ETrade (garbage)**

\- Trading restrictions on GME/AMC/BB allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of these securities during Thursdays trading Rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

**Schwab/TD Ameritrade (reasonable)**

\- Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\- Limiting short selling on volatile tickers (limiting trades with unlimited risk)

\- Raised margin requirements on many securities

\- Allowed trading of volatile securities once cash deposits were verified (many new accounts experienced this issue as new funds were not settled)

Both of these restrictions are reasonable as they have unlimited risk and are not trying to be liable for any substantial losses

**Fidelity/Vanguard (Best)**

\- Raised margin requirements on many securities

\- Limiting short selling on volatile tickers (limiting trades with unlimited risk)

Both of these restrictions are reasonable as they have unlimited risk and are not trying to be liable for any substantial losses

Thousands of upset retail investors will be fleeing RH, IBRK, Webull and Etrade over the next couple of weeks. Switching to Fidelity and Schwab/TD Ameritrade.

I would also go long Fidelity investments but it is not publicly traded.

**Schwab Analysis**

**User Growth:**

The amount of brand new retail investors opening up accounts over the past week is ridiculous. GME + AMC + BB pump has been blasted across every media station. Every online brokerage was experience server lag and strain over the past week due to the increased volume from new retail investors. Traffic on these sites were 3-4 times what they normally were during the recent trading frenzy.

RH/Webull/Etrade/IBRK transfers - many retail investors will be transferring over their accounts as a result of the trade restrictions and collusion with hedge funds. Listed below are the total accounts at each brokerage

RH: 13 million accounts

Etrade: 5.2 million accounts

Webull: 2 million accounts

IBRK: 700k accounts

Even if only a small portion of users switch brokerages 5-10% we are still looking at 1-2 million new accounts up for grabs between TD/Schwab/Fidelity/Vanguard

More users = more deposits/commission = more profits = stonks go up

**Reputation -** RH/Webull/Etrade/IBRK have had their app ratings and reputation destroyed thanks to reviewing bombing as a result of market collusion. These low reviews will discourage any new retail investors from using their platforms and push them towards TD/Schwab/Fidelity.

**Discount:**

$SCHW is trading at a 17% discount (as of PM on Friday) from its January high all while new retail investors and user registrations and deposits reached an all time high over the past week. Negative media coverage and market sell off this week has caused every publicly traded brokerage company to sell of from their highs. With a market rebound and new user registration data for January this stock will fly past its ATH's and run into the 70's.

**Average Daily Users**

The average daily website users has seen almost a 20% increase from the October 2020 numbers to December 2020 alone. The January numbers will even be substantially higher with TD Ameritrade and Schwab both reporting network strain due to the influx of new investors signing up last week to get into GME/AMC/BB. This trend wont be stopping anytime soon, the retail investor's strength is gaining. Just look at Wallstreetbets alone we had 2.2 million members as of Monday and now we are sitting at 7 million.

**Upcoming Earnings**

$SCHW is going to crush their upcoming earnings for Q1 2021 in April. They acquired TD Ameritrade on October 6. The amount of new retail investors has exploded over the last couple of months. Just look at last years growth in new accounts most brokerages have seen a over 100% increase in 2020 traffic. Their next earnings report for Q1 2021 will be the first quarter with 3 full months of combined revenue from both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab. There will also be a mass exodus of upset traders fleeing Webull, Etrade and Robinhood by the thousands and transferring their assets into TD Ameritrade and Schwab.

**Future/Longevity of Brokerages:**

TD Ameritrade/Schwab will be one of the few brokerages not being slammed by class action lawsuits as a result of the manipulation today. E Trade, RobinHood, IBRK and Webull will have users fleeing in the masses to new brokerages. Do you really want to leave your money sitting on a brokerages that may have pending lawsuits against it and possible liquidity issues? (looking at you Robinhood)

**Price Target:** Bank of America just upgraded $SCHW on January 12 giving it a $68 target. Stating their has been mass growth in retail users. This was prior to the new user explosion the past 2 weeks. This stock will easily run to $70 once data comes out for January 2021 on the amount of new users and transfers.

**TLDR:** $SCHW will crush its Q1 2021 earnings thanks to an explosion in new retail investors as a result of the media coverage on GME and AMC. Retail traders on platforms that halted trading activity on Thursday will also be transferring their holdings to Schwab + TD Ameritrade. $SCHW is at a discount thanks to the market sell off and will rebound to $70+ once registration data comes out for January.

Position: 02/05/2021 & 02/12/2021 $57 Calls

Calls are dirt cheap as this stock is seen as a boomer stock with low volatility.

EDIT: A few people saying TD/Schw/Fidelity were no allowing GME/BB/AMC trading. This may be a result of your cash not settling. New accounts needed their funds to settle before trading these higher volatility tickers. Any errors popping up may also be due to server strain, I was using TD and RBC in Canada and had issues finding tickers/entering into positions

EDIT 2: Schwab will be giving its winter business update on Tuesday at 11am. I expect them to discuss the massive growth in retail investors which should help this stock bounce.

EDIT 3: talked to a online agent about transferring over investments into Schwab. He mentioned that there has been more transfer requests in the last couple days then all of last quarter causing wait times/rep times to go from 5 minutes on hold to over a hour on average."|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|['DD']|[]|['TD', '$SCHW', 'TD', 'GME', 'AMC', 'RH', 'GME', 'BB', 'CEO', 'CNBC', 'GME', 'BB', 'GME', 'TD', 'GME', 'RH', 'IBRK', 'TD', 'I', 'GME', 'AMC', 'BB', 'IBRK', 'IBRK', '$SCHW', 'PM', 'TD', 'BB', '$SCHW', 'TD', 'TD', 'TD', 'TD', 'E', 'IBRK', '$SCHW', '$SCHW', 'GME', 'AMC', 'TD', '$SCHW', 'A', 'AMC', 'I', 'TD', 'RBC', 'EDIT', 'I', 'EDIT']|['SCHW', 'GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'SCHW', 'SCHW', 'SCHW', 'SCHW', 'GME', 'AMC', 'SCHW', 'AMC']

Tendietime, memes, 🚀emojis🤝💎, whatever motivation you think you still need for tomorrow and the days after to just HOLD, **its actually much simpler.**

So mute your evening drawing class for a minute, chew your crayons to help you concentrate and focus on what im telling you.

We know:

**A) Shorts** [**bleed**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9dukq/its_working_melvin_capital_lost_53_in_january/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) **by holding short positions. Shorts desperately want to close positions.**

**B) To close, they have to buy stonks from us;** *saw a post earlier (help me find it?) saying we hold most of the shares.*

**C) If they buy, price goes up because we dictate the ask.**

so by easy, 2 braincell logic, whoever sells first, will automatically be the first to miss out on the tendies that follow.

Now idk about you guys, but my 3 braincells seem to only exist to make me think about what i missed out on,

>""why didnt i buy earlier"", ""why didnt i buy more"", ""why did i not take out a fucking loan"".

Im more okay with holding too long than too short

(fuck short anyways right?)

The essence is: what will you tell your 3 friends when they ask how much you made?

>""yea nah i sold at 600 haha, i know it went to 5000 but you know that old boomer who said you cant time the market haha? now lets go celebrate at wendys i'll let you guys choose anything you want from the dollar menu haha""

Dont be that guy

Now go back drooling at your art teachers cutout, delete your limit orders and when your artificial mistress Alexa wakes you up tomorrow with the generic ""I love you my lovely toilet-tiger"" and your old notification to sell on market open, tell her shes not real and ask if she allows you to stay in bed for 10 more minutes

TL;DR:

As soon as you sell, it drives the price up further because shorts have to cover and buy at our ask, therefore the sooner you sell, the more potential gains you will miss out on.

The board's objective is to make this a long-term win. It is not to either pump the price or burn the shorts. Burning the shorts is fun for them, but not their job. A significant cash infusion via capital raise (around $1 billion or so) would increase their positive outcomes a lot. There are a few ways to do this, but I think the best is a rights dividend/warrant offering where current shareholders get warrants. This would have some unpredictable effects on the stock and possibly cause some unpredictable short-term volatility, but would ultimately reduce volatility a lot..**

*Disclaimer: Not financial/investing/tax advice. I'm not a sell-side expert and don't have investment banking experience, but if any sell-side experts give me commentary on this thread I'll integrate and credit. I probably got some details wrong. I'm short-term bullish on this stock, but have a tiny long-term put position.*

Gamestop as a business would long-term benefit from more cash right now. They have 949m of long-term debt, and a bunch of leases they'd like to cancel (and severance payments they'd have to make with those store closures to laid off employees specific to those stores). They also would like to accelerate their development of more profitable businesses (such as eCommerce, any new ideas, and the rest). Extinguishing this debt completely, ditching bad stores, and investing in growth would all make sense to an extent, even if they turn around and issue new debt (at a much lower interest rate since their financial situation will be improved).

To do this, they need to raise capital. While they could use debt, I don't think that makes sense with equity at these values. Therefore, they will try equity if they do. The three approaches that make some sense (Also the three most frequent approaches) are to do a secondary offering (similar to an IPO, which is a primary offering), do an off-the-shelf offering (which they technically can already do $100m of), or do a rights distribution.

Additionally, GME will want to regain control of their stock. Tilray's founder commented on this recently, but basically, when the stock is like this, there are a lot of side effects  - more legal risks, any options or RSUs you issue employees stop being long-term motivating, a lot of early retirements as people cash out their options, and just a huge amount of press that is unrelated to your business goals. It's not actually good for the business to have a stock this volatile.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/tilray-ceo-brendan-kennedy-issues-a-warning-to-gamestop-amc-bosses.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/tilray-ceo-brendan-kennedy-issues-a-warning-to-gamestop-amc-bosses.html)

Here is some more detail of my non-professional understanding of these fundraising methods. I think a rights distribution is most likely.

**Secondary Listing:**

This would involve them bundling a bunch of institutions and offering new shares out, just like an IPO. The problem is that to do this, they have to offer at a discount. This will enrage current shareholders. This also will allow shorts to cover more or less immediately, which also will enrage the current shareholders. I think this one is bad press all around, and I think they'd have to offer a very large discount to get institutions comfortable with doing it given the daily volatility. They also open themselves up to lawsuits, because the price is very volatile, and if GME is, for example at $100 3 weeks from now, it's an instant lawsuit. by both current and new shareholders because the losses are so large. I think this is their worst option.

**Off The Shelf Listing:**

GME already has a $100m authorization for this. I suspect (but don't know) they already used it I believe there are some timing issues here, but this is the second best option. I think there are some timing delays on being able to use it, and there may still be some legal risks I'm unaware of. Optically, I think it looks not great because it will run contrary to the fervor gripping the stock right now and be seen as giving the shorts a bit of a lifeline.

**Public Rights Distribution:**

A write-up on this in general here:

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rightsoffering.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rightsoffering.asp)

I think this is their best option. In this, they would dividend out warrants to shareholders (this is an option, except you pay the company for the share and they make a new share, instead of someone having to sell you an existing share - so it dilutes. Usually this is done as 1 warrant per X shares. So for example, they might dividend out 1 warrant for every 5 shares held. They could then set a warrant exercise price that is low compared to the current price, but obviously not lawsuit bait, such as $20. Dividending out two warrants per 3 shares long at this price would likely result in full conversion right now, and raise them $1,000,000,000 roughly in cash.  Because these ONLY go to existing shareholders, it ends up not being dilutive in the same way other offerings are - everyone can preserve their share if they put capital in - does not punish longs. **Realistically though, they'll want to issue the fewest warrants possible at the highest price they can justify and avoid danger because the more warrants they issue, the more it increases the value of puts and can create unintended consequences.**

The way this would play out is that they'd first announce the rights distribution, probably a few days to a week before. This will result in some interesting market dynamics that I'll describe in a moment.

Then, you'd get the rights distribution as a GME long. As a GME short, you'd have to SERVE UP THE RIGHTS DISTRIBUTION to the long you borrowed shares from.  Because there are a lot more longs than shares, this would have some chaos, which the market makers would have to sort out.

Then, there would be a short time during which people have to elect to exercise the warrant, which you'd be able to do through your broker They'll want this as short as possible so that the price doesn't fall below the warrant price.

Then, they clear all the warrants, and a day or two later, deliver all the shares to people.

This is their best approach I think because it gets them capital without being pain to existing longs, while also reducing their lawsuit risk compared to the others because they are just distributing a right at a low price to existing longs on equal footing, who are the ones who have standing to sue them in the first place.

I don't know how the laws would work on insiders - I think they can exercise these, but I'm sure there are a lot of details on the timing of it. They probably need to do it well ahead of q4 earnings lockup to be clean.

**Rights Market Dynamics:**

I find this very hard to predict, but this would have a few effects.

1. Upon the warrants/rights being granted (NOT declared), stock will fall in price significantly, but longs shouldn't actually lose money because they also were granted warrants. In theory, warrant value + stock value for a given number of shares (plus their granted warrants) should be the same as the prior stock price. In other words, I don't really see it as bearish or bullish.
2. You would not want to be long call options through this. Very ITM calls and calls that expire before the distribution would be largely and completely unaffected respectively, but OTM longer dated calls would get destroyed the moment this is announced. If you do have an ITM call, you will want to get out of it before the distribution by either exercising to get shares, or selling it. If you sell and are still bullish, you can then go and buy shares. Would not recommend trying to buy OTM calls after this repricing, though I guess you could.
3. Puts are the reverse. Puts that are shorter dated than the distribution don't change. Puts that are longer dated go up in price a lot even though the total value of the company didn't change.
4. You could be short through this, but it's a little annoying. Most likely, you'll be marked short the warrant, so the warrant share structure will kind of mirror the current long structure, but this has to be closed out before the exercise date, so warrants will all get called in at some point. **In a sense, it's forcing shorts to cover a good portion of their short** since the warrant will arbitrage such that the warrants granted + stocks originally held = same value as the stock alone was before. They'd have to get the cash to buy warrants on the market to deliver to people you borrowed from. Likely a bit of a mess. Would cause some short covering, alongside that call selling. Would this be more buying or selling? I don't know, the stock is super levered. I don't think it would matter a lot initially though.
5. After the distribution happens, the stock should reduce volatility after the initial price renormalization of warrants distributed + original stock = same market cap (but stock price down). This will be more the case after shares delivered. The reason the volatility reduces is that this will reduce the leverage in the stock - calls on one side, short on the other. It also eliminates the bankruptcy thesis that shorts were in on in the first place.
6. GME would regain control of their stock and be set up for a faster turn-around.

The only downside of this is it's a bit less intuitive and will require significant explaining to people. But I think it's the most fair to existing shareholders, causes the least legal risk, and puts the company in an excellent position to do their turn-around.

What I'm uncertain on is if there are weird gamma squeeze dynamics from the share price being implied to be lower after a distribution. They may want to distribute more modestly than I'm suggesting for this reason.

**Other Unknowns:**

I don't know what restrictions are on how many warrants they can toss out and if shareholder votes are required. It seems to me it's close to a stock split, so maybe none? Any investment bankers have thoughts on this - minimum price they can offer a warrant if equal distribution to all shareholders? Maximum dilution? In situations where they have to issue warrants at or above current price, this obviously would not work at all. My sense is they can be at a discount, and can dilute, but may have maximums. Anyone able to confirm who is an expert?

**Timing**

My understanding which may be incorrect is they can’t do this before earnings. Their fiscal year I think ends this week? So they’d have to hurry to do this. Would not be surprised at an early earnings in order to facilitate. Early earnings is a tell that capital raise incoming."|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|['GME', 'I']|['GME']|['A', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'IPO', 'GME', 'I', 'IPO', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'I', 'X', 'ONLY', 'GME', 'GME', 'SERVE', 'UP', 'THE', 'IGHTS', 'UTION', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'NOT', 'I', 'ITM', 'OTM', 'ITM', 'OTM', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

You're not wrong, but theres some major issues.

It's a 1.5 Trillion dollar market cap. There is a hard case for the WSB, if acting in collusion which it shouldn't, cause that's naughty, to move silver.

Citadel, et al own a real stake in silver. Maybe deal with one issue at a time.  They would be enriched by this play, which effectively undoes doing them dirty.  Do you really wanna give them a reach around while you're savaging their red little asses?

Think about who owns the physical good.  This would cause physical silver to rocket, enriching some pretty nasty despots (both political and financial). None of this exists in a vacuum.

Every time someone has tried to mess with the silver market at scale it's blown up in their faces. Especially the Hunt brothers (Silver Thursday in 1980).  They literally lost their billion dollar family fortune in the mid 80's (from the stuff stemming from 1980)

Precious metals are a far more liquid market, with far greater trading times, and more world markets effecting price.  This means there are more players.  WSB was the David in the GME story, and won't register on the Silver market. You have COMEX & LBMA.

JPM is one of the big Market Makers.  Citadel et al aren't even a blip compared to JPM.

I'm saying it's not even bringing a knife to a gun fight.  It's bringing a rubber band gun to a nuclear arms meeting.

These MF's are gonna eat all your tendies for an appetizer and want more.

That said, the existing DD has had very very valid points.  Silver is logically a sound investment, especially after QE Eleventy Billion.  I'm saying bleach your mind of the thought of attempting to impact the silver market.

Let's talk about the theory behind using magic lines; Momentum in stocks can be somewhat predictable, and 'Elliot Wave Theory' depicts just that (Figuring out what a reasonable Price target to set and how long these rallies can push for is more complex and we wont talk about it.) 

Follow along as you look below: Stonks go, ""Up, dip, up, dip, up"" before going ""dump, bump, dump."" 

![img](1ddqqikagpe61 ""Think of these depicted trends as - Swingable trades / Multi-week / Long term.        
 (When we are looking at GME charts below, imagine the charts are Starting right after the 'support' was found at the number '13' on the Long term trendline.)"")

&#x200B;

How do we relate this to GME? Bullishly, I would say we are about to enter the last 'impulse wave' (Top trend line in the picture above,) and that price movement on Monday/Tuesday this week will say a lot about how drastically this squeeze will truly be pushed upwards. (Rising wedge depicted below)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[If there is a dip into the 300-320 range in P-M, I would load there; if below $300 is broken, beware, as it very well may act as a neckline break of a H&S formation. With that said, I love that volume that can be seen picking up late Friday; another bullish look.](https://preview.redd.it/d6xbmnkoipe61.png?width=1518&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b68b8faa4bf6a3342ca6910331053e24411324e)

&#x200B;

Now, I'm not in love with the wave cycle above  and that we appear to be on relative to the Long term stages of this movement to be completely honest, and after including the PM/AH price movements... It appears that on Thursday morning GME had started the first move in it's final impulse wave higher to find the peak; Meaning, the *squeeze was very likely to be squoze* going into into Thursday's Open Market had retail not been almost totally restricted from buying.

 (See chart Below; (5) would've been 'peak' - perhaps around 1k/share.)

[Think of it this way - without restricting buying, retail would've bought the PM\/opening dips like crazy, solidifying the first impulse wave & sending us off into another Gamma Squeeze\/Short-Squeeze combo. This was already AFTER the drop in the general markets on Wednesday, what I suspect to have been a result of big-boys liquidating longs.](https://preview.redd.it/e7ng28xsjpe61.png?width=1518&format=png&auto=webp&s=704cd948d59d85cf149eba94ba49a60f1cfc6c0f)

Finally, a bit of AMC analysis.... Here we see a similar story to GME, appearing to be within a rising wedge, ready to start its next impulse wave upwards. 3-6 mo PT of $28

Many of us are probably watching the short interest % of float to indicate when the short squeeze is squoze. At this point, the hedge funds clearly know this, given how hard they've spent the last couple days using their MSM shills to announce ""WE HAVE EXITED OUR SHORT POSITIONS!!! YOU WIN!""

There is a chance we're going to see that short interest % of float number go down at the same time as the price drops. Failure-to-delivers may also go down, at least in appearance.

# This is probably a lie.

Failure-to-deliver numbers and the short interest % are just the tip of the giant dildo they're trying to fuck us with. If this thing is actually what it looks like, they have way, way, *way* more exposure to this shitstorm than they are letting on.

There are ways for hedge funds and their colluding market makers to hide their exposure to a counterfeit stock scheme / naked short / short attack. You can read all about it here: [counterfeiting stock 2.0](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) (again, credit to johnny for bringing this to our attention)

If you don't know how to read, just scroll down to the picture of the iceberg.

If you **do** know how to read but don't have a lot of time, still scroll down to the picture of the iceberg, and start reading from there.

**TL: DR**\-- using a bag of dirty tricks, hedge funds can ""unwind"" their *disclosed* short positions, without ever having to exit their *real* short positions-- the ones that are actually super dangerous and putting them at risk of insolvency. They are going to do everything they can to get us to sell, **up to and including fucking with the disclosed short interest % of float-- the number we're all watching.**

So watch the short interest with a titanic-sized grain of salt. It could go up, it could go down, but it's likely not anywhere close to their real risk exposure either way.

My GME positions:  4 @ 329, 2 @ 325, 13 @ 272.

I originally bought in at $14 and sold at $19 like a paper-handed bitch.Now I'm holding until $10,000.

*I'm an ape, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, this is not financial advice, do your own research, etc.*

**EDIT:** if you have a lot of time on your hands and want some more research on how this works and maybe a little peek into what we're in for, see u/Sleavitt10's comment [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9jbc5/listen_to_me_we_cannot_trust_the_short_interest/glib7cs/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

**EDIT 2:** people are pointing out that that source I’m using says short squeezes aren’t really possible anymore, because counterfeiting can overcome any amount of buy-side pressure. And normally I would agree, but there are exceptions.

Like when a counterfeiting scheme runs into a multi-million-man army of enraged retail investors who are willing to buy the stock at any price, for example. And remember, the longer this goes on, the more they lose, so they are highly motivated to produce a quick resolution. The desperate moves on Thursday and Friday that ultimately failed are proof of what a serious situation this is becoming for them.

The sheer number of retail investors who are buying this stock just to fuck up the short attack is absolutely mind boggling. So long as we maintain our numbers and resolve, they must spend more and more money to get out of the hole.

Hold. The. Line.

**EDIT 3:** [IT'S ALREADY FUCKING HAPPENING.](https://twitter.com/jonpeterswrites/status/1356019766624923654) 6 hours ago shorts weren't covering, and suddenly they've covered 30 mil on 50 mil volume? I don't fucking THINK so. And even if they are, that doesn't unwind the 2-3x as many shorts built on top of imaginary shares.

So far so good.

The problem with SLV is that silver IS NOT A CENTRALIZED MARKET!

The biggest silver market is COMEX, which is a futures market. See, futures markets aren't the same thing as single stock markets, they are much bigger, have more institutions rather than retail investors and they are much more complicated.

When a typical retard buys gme, they hit buy market and that's it, they now have 1 share. 

In futures, it's different. You buy contracts, these contracts are standardized and the most popular contract for silver is : SI . SI has a contract size of 5000 troy ounces!! One contract is equal to  135000 $ worth of silver. You don't need to pay 135k for a contract, you can buy it for 14k if you close the position before you need to take delivery of the silver.

Some of you might have 14k, but the risk is very high: if silver moves down 1 dollar you lose 5k.

Another problem in the silver market are the participants: goverments own silver, hedge funds own silver, investment funds own silver, too many people own too much silver!! Gamestop is at about 30 billion dollars marketcap ( and that's now ). 

The open interest on the latest SI contract is 135 960, giving it an open interest value (which admitedly is not marketcap) of 18.354.600.000 usd. 18 billion usd in just open interest. 

Open interest is how many positions are open at any given time.

Silver is a much bigger market, with more big players.

GME - there weren't so many hedge funds (poor Melvin, that was the one big hedge fund shorting gme) and so it was a subreddit against a fund, and we won.

Silver is a different story - JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi, hedge funds, governments, a lot more money is in silver than gme.

For these reasons, don't go into SLV, you will just play where the big boys want you to play, they have the advantage there.

tl;dr : Silver won't moon, banks have advantage, hold gme to 10k."|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|['SLV']|[]|['SLV', 'IS', 'NOT', 'A', 'LIZED', 'ARKET', 'COMEX', 'SI', 'SI', 'SI', 'GME', 'JP', 'SLV']|['GME']

Before breaking down why this is important, let's quickly recap some of the highlights of last week:

GameStop had one of its first big pops to open the market Wednesday and remained volatile all day. Thursday, it opened with another significant pop, and then HFs employed some perfectly timed and very illegal market manipulation tactics. Some of the largest brokerages with the most retail investors blocked the purchase of GME shares, and only allowed the current investors to sell the stock. HFs coupled this restriction in free trade with what is commonly referred to as a short ladder attack, which is another form of market manipulation to fabricate the illusion that a stock is plummeting. Newly invested retail traders watched this play-out over the course of the day, and with only the option to sell and seeing their initial investment plummet quickly probably sold the shares, freeing them for Hedge Funds to scoop up. 

Friday morning opened with another pop and the SEC issued a statement that they will be closely monitoring the price volatility of certain stocks, which put HFs on notice, and publicly acknowledged that they are paying attention to the situation. Meanwhile, trade across many of the brokerages that had previously blocked their customers from buying reopened the option to buy, but with significant restrictions. 

🖐💎**TL;DR RE: LAST WEEK 💎🖐**

Starting Wednesday, GME opened everyday with a big pop likely due to the fever pitch of news and interest combined with HFs slowly covering their positions. Tomfoolery was rampant as HFs tried to tamp down a potentially imminent squeeze. 

🖐💎**SELL LIMIT ORDERS 💎🖐**

Okay, so why are sell limit orders so important this coming week? Or many of you may even be asking WHAT IS a sell limit order? To borrow a very succinct analogy: if you are an 🦍 holding a 🍌, the sell limit order is the number you tell your brokerage you're willing to sell your 🍌for. This number can be seen by the market, and the HFs can see these numbers, but more importantly, they can see ALL of them. This is key because depending on how long you've been tracking GME on WSB, you have likely seen several comments saying something along the lines of ""$420.69 IS NOT A MEME"" and it has continually increased from 1k, 5k, 10k, etc. Which is where we get to the meat of this post because if everyone sets the sell limit orders to these memeable numbers, the HFs can see these massive clusters of sell orders and WILL buy them, which will trigger massive drops in share price, and in turn likely cause panic selling much like we saw during the short ladder attack on Thursday. So what next?

**I DONT FUCKING KNOW CAUSE I AM NOT OFFERING FINANCIAL ADVICE, ONLY KNOWLEDGE AS UNDERSTOOD BY ME**

But here's the thing: these particular HFs have turned the market into a game, and a very select few badasses noticed this early on, and then started playing. After much due diligence by the thousands of redditors on this sub, more and more people learned the rules, saw an opportunity, and bought shares of GameStop because they like the stock. These HFs are now counting on all of us retail investors, especially those who are playing on hard mode and don't understand the market, to cut and run and give them an out. 

🖐💎**TL;DR💎🖐**

These particular hedge funds have turned the market into a game. They used cheat codes all last week, and are literally banking on newer retail investors who are playing on hard mode to lose and give them an easy out.

Again, this is not financial advice and I truly am a dummy. I've just been lucky enough to use my nephew's iPad to educate myself whenever he gets distracted, which is usually only during lunch time because Patrick loves tendies. And finally:

You use your money exactly how you see fit and take responsibly for your own trades. Secondly this is not a ""squeeze"" play.

Nokia is one of the largest telecommunication companies in the world, as well as one of the front running companies for 5G.  Nokia now has a significant hold in all of the world’s early 5G adopters. Including deals with the top four communication service providers in the United States as well as the top three providers in Japan and Korea. Multinational contracts and deals have placed Nokia at the top when it comes to 5G and it will only be getting bigger when 5G is more accessible to people like us. Last week we ran Nokia up to almost 9 dollars before multiple halts stopped all the momentum. Then the trading restrictions on Robinhood and other brokerages hurt the momentum even more. I believe this was to help the hedge funds cover there ass before the inevitable movement up were going to have in the future. With trade restrictions being lifted on most platforms and earnings coming on Thursday we should see a big move up. This is a value company, with huge room for growth. The hedge funds manipulated this hard dropping from 6 to 4.60. We will not let them win and short another great company into the ground. Nokia is one of the most undervalued stocks on the market. The more we go up the more hedge funds will try and short. Buy shares and hold for a long time. This is a great company.

This has escalated faster than my dick when DFV posts, While pretty much everyone who bought into GME sub 20 knew there were massive tendies to be made, not single person in this entire scenario expected it to play out like this.  


Lets take a step back and review the FACTS, amidst the bot attacks, fake news, and overall noise coming from the powers at be.

1. **Gamestops long term prospects look good: marketing, $$$ and more $$$**

fundamentals are what we care about as the business needs to go through a paradigm shift in its model, thankfully, it has. We can all thank new daddy cohen for making this happen by investing in the long term strategy for revamping a business that was on its way out. He involved himself on the board, brought in his former chewy associates, and is making bigly moves to start setting up their pivot. Gamestop would naturally start to increase as speculators saw serious financial backing from an independent investor with an alignment between management and shareholders starting to form. Obviously when board members and c-suits are shareholders they have vested interest in the performance of the company, if you go and [read wikipedia on gme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop) you will see that they did not have any shareholders in upper level management, until 2019 which helped create the situation we are in, if the people running the company do not care about the value of it, they have no concern to prevent the value from being destroyed. So yay, management now gives a fuck. we have our first ingredient, ***aligned $$$***

Now on to the second ingredient, big $$$

Gamestop has to finance its operations for 2019 and 2020 as it went deep into the red, the lack of free cash flow and poor sales prospects drilled their credit rating to emerging market status, and set them up to fail if they could not find profits again, which with shit management is to be expected. With the new interest from stakeholders, GME took off, gaining market cap, and opening up a new avenue of financing. Even if GME hit a modest market cap of lets say 6.5bb, they would have been able to raise money without diluting the float by much. But now with a market cap approaching 20+bb its becoming absurdly easy for them to raise capital, hell even raising a cool billion becomes viable now via a secondary offering.   Gamestop has become a self fulfilling prophecy as of no amount of shorting can sustain a low value for the stock, so they have a solid avenue to raise more cash. Which in turn means they can pay off their debt, increase their credit rating, and what do you know all of the sudden they can become profitable again.   


third ingredient: attention and faith.

self explanatory, the whole hedge fund situation has brought more media attention to gamestop than any other form of marketing, now literally everyone and their mother will know about GME forever and a lot of people who used to engage with the brand are now flocking back. Now combine that with the faith that new daddy cohen has inspired you have a recipe for MASSIVE TENDIES

&#x200B;

now when we combine, aligned monetary interests, with new financing capability, huge investor confidence on management AND brand awareness. well fuck me thats one hell of a grand slam. 

with these few ingredients GME can cook up so many tendies, we already know they are working on making PC gaming more mainstream, and with all the renewed interest they can definitely pivot to some more interesting revenue streams, think the nintendo center in NYC for the heads who know, gamestops could become these social venues where gamers meet up and play together, or maybe hangout and have a beer. adult gaming and entertainment is actually taking off with the millennials and I expected it to be a serious path forward for gamestop. maybe not exactly like a video game bar, but some form of live social-gaming experience is something that I think is highly likely they will integrate. 

2. The financial institutions have their back against the wall, nothing can save them other than a gov bailout, its really a matter of closing the loss on the way down.

There is no fucking way on this planet that these shorters walk away from this in one piece, i do not think they will become insolvent because you know, wall street, but there is no way they do not take heavy losses. The sheer grit from new comers, lurkers, big names, and OGs is unspeakable. people have taken this scenario personally and people are just throwing money at this simply to say, BEARS R FUKT HEDGIES EAT COCK, which is not something this hedge fuckers could have seen coming. They have an innate arrogance that prevents them from considering such things. They know how much money they control, how to influence the right people, and their all homies with the important people so why should they care about the little guy when they can bend us over and fuck us whenever they want? well jokes on them cuz my wife's boyfriend already went to pound town and my ass can handle the pain. And guess what? SO CAN EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS GAME NOW, people are just buying, buying, and then buying some more, no matter the financial hurt, the buy side pressure has not and will not degrade(maybe when we hit 500+ a share since a lot of people might get priced out then) but it is a losing battle for them as every retail buy takes another share off the market. So they are in a pretty pickle. the longer they wait us out, the fewer shares they have to work with. The higher the price the more they bleed, the more they short, the worse it gets. Basically the longer they wait the more fucked they are, so HOLD because they will be trying everything we have seen this past week on us to get us to sell, become distracted, create FUD, prevent us from buying, restrict options, you name it. 

&#x200B;

All we need are these two points and you can start to see how there is literally no way out for these guys, the challenge, the real challenge ( that gives us our diamond hands) is waiting. yes PATIENCE, as buffet has once said, "" The stock market is a device to transfer money from the impatient to the patient"". WE ARE THE PATIENT, WE ARE STRONG TOGETHER, WE ARE THE FUCKING PLAYERS. And the hedgies know it. they are the impatient ones as each day they lose money, and each day they have to ***work*** to remain afloat. Every single person on this sub does not need to do shit other than buy GME when you see it at a price you like and never sell until the shorts have bled all their capital. 

&#x200B;

TLDR; GameStop has all the ingredients to generate, real long term value for their shareholders, be patient. The shorts have already lost, its a matter of how much now, be patient, the hedgies have to work everyday to figure out how to unfuck themselves, while we just has to scroll WSB and find confirmation bias DD like this one. pretty simple, be patient, watch shorts cry, make unlimited tendies. DO NOT LET ANYONE INFLUENCE YOUR DECISION ON WHETHER TO BUY OR SELL GME, MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS AND STAND BY THEM. I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL, THESE ARE MY OPINIONS, NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE

# GameStop Short Nightmare Shows Few Signs of Becoming a Contagion

[GameStop Corp.’s](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GME:US) surge has struck fear into anyone caught on the wrong side of its ascent. But those **bearish positions probably aren’t big enough to lay low the larger universe of investment funds**.

That’s the view of Barclays Plc strategists led by Maneesh Deshpande. By plotting the value of bearish equity bets versus the whole market’s capitalization, they found that short sales have actually dwindled during the past year to the lowest level since at least 2008. Moreover, those **most-heavily shorted companies targeted by day traders this year had bearish wagers amounting to less than 0.001% of the $43 trillion market.**

Whether losses being suffered by hedge funds and other money pools will be large enough to ignite a full-blown contagion was a concern that arose several times during last week’s selling -- the worst in the S&P 500 since October. For now, while Reddit-fueled stock jocks may have drowned out every other narrative, they’re unlikely to completely subsume the bull market.

 “We’re witnessing a nearly unprecedented amount of speculative activity. But on the other hand, **we are talking about a very narrow group of stocks that don’t have an outsize influence**,” said Marshall Front, chief investment officer at Front Barnett Associates. “**The underlying fundamentals of the economy are strong. A very aggressive and accommodative policy by the Federal Reserve is still intact. Together, they help the stock market on the way up**.”

Burned by short sales going against them, hedge funds have yanked money from the market at one of the fastest rates on record. The most-shorted stocks rallied 14% last week as a group, dealing the biggest blow to short sellers since last April, a [Goldman Sachs Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US) basket shows.

While the **S&P 500 dropped more than 3% last week, traders described the broad market as orderly**. To JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s strategists including Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, the retreat is likely a “short-lived technical tumble.” With earnings improving and U.S. consumers strengthening, this pullback is another opportunity to add stocks, particularly those geared toward an economic recovery, the strategists wrote in a Friday note.

 To be sure, day traders are targeting companies favored by bearish investors, trying to spur squeezes. In 2021, the top quintile of the Russell 3000 stocks with the highest short sales as a percentage of their float is up 20%, compared with a loss of 0.8% for the bottom 600, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But those returns are also consistent with a contour that was already taking shape as investor risk appetite increased: gains in companies with shakier finances, which had trailed during 2020’s pandemic market.

“Although the short squeeze started with GME, it appears to be spreading to a wider range of stocks,” Deshpande at Barclays wrote in a note Friday, referring to GameStop’s ticker. “While we expect some more deleveraging, ultimately the scale of the problem appears quite limited.”

By Barclays’s tally, **short sales totaled $800 billion, or roughly 2% of the total market value of American equities, a sign that short sellers have not extended themselves**. The heavily shorted companies -- those with interest making up more than 20% of their share float -- saw $40 billion of their stock sold short, or 5% of the total pool of bearish bets.

“We remain optimistic that it is likely to remain localized,” Deshpande said. “**The bottom line is that while the pain could continue in the short term, the risk of a full-fledged contagion remains low**.”"|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|['SPY', 'CALLS', 'VIX', 'PUTS', 'HOLD']|[]|['GME', 'SPY', 'VIX', 'GME', 'I', 'P', 'A', 'P', 'U', 'S', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME']

This has been posted before but I think it’s VERY important to know, maybe even should be pinned.


We don’t know if/which brokerages will be instituting buy-order restriction’s on GME etc this week.   If anyone who is interested (and can afford to) still wants to buy shares, know that it is still possible to EXERCISE your call options.  By exercising, they are required to give you the 100 shares you bought.

**How does it work?**


ELI5:  each Call contract is for 100 shares at the strike price.  You’d want to purchase deep ITM Calls, with minimal extrinsic value left in the contract.  On Robinhood, this is manifested as the “To Break Even%”, where this number would ideally be 0% for immediate exercise.

https://imgur.com/a/5VGZvxZ

On other brokerages such as ToS displayed in the link as well, you may just have to do some quick maths to figure out the relative costs.


**How do I know if exercising is worth it?**

Immediately Exercising a Call is supposed to be similar to buying 100 shares outright, right?  But since immediate exercise isn’t how options are usually used, there will be some extra costs involved.

Math:

If $GME is at $300, it would cost $30,000 to buy 100 shares at $300 each.  
**100 shares = $30,000**

If we do this via a (theoretical) option:
Lets say GME is at $300 still.  And lets say the $45 strike Call for Feb.5 costs “$285” each.  You’ll pay that $285 to buy the contract.  Now if you want to exercise that contract, you will pay another $45 for each of the 100 shares you’re exercising the right to buy.
In this example, (45+285)*100 = 33,000
**100 shares = $33,000**


*(strike price + contract cost) x 100 = the cost to immediately buy 100 shares via options*



Obviously this isn’t ideal,  but if RobbingHood et. al. continue their restrictions, this will likely be how I will purchase shares of a stock I like.   I would likely be paying an extra premium per share as you saw, *BUT WHO CARES ABOUT PAYING EXTRA IF WE’RE GOING TO THE MOON ANYWAY*


**How do I exercise an option (on RobbingHood??**

On RH there’s a handy little “Exercise” button when you click on your Call.  You’d just click through the screens to do it.  https://imgur.com/a/BGKCnz1



I’m sorry if formatting is bad and the explanation was *quick and dirty* but I have a feeling many of us will be stuck holding and unable to buy shares outright once again.  If you have questions I Will try to answer in the comments, and if anyone has something better to explain then feel free.

*not financial advice, dumbass*

Canopy Growth Corp $CGC. ~~We could force a national conversation about marijuana reform and free millions of people, from reddit.~~ On top of being a great company **that is already the official sports drink for TWO NBA teams** they represent a unique opportunity to make tendies, continue to make an impact on the world around us with our tendies, **and free fellow retards**. While we have all eyes on us, instead of taking on JP Morgan, let's help out the **millions** of future retards currently sitting in prison wishing they could join our moon missions.

**No one wants to be seen as targeting shorts** and I want to make it clear, that is NOT the intention here. This is a company with wildly large🚀🚀 **catalysts**🚀🚀 coming very soon, and already starting to boil. **EVERYONE SHOULD DEMAND TO KNOW THE SHORT LOGIC** instead of defending long positions, especially with an amazing year ahead. Why would you short this stock? To me it's probably the same people who think weed turns you into a couch. You know the commercial.

Mercury is also the Roman god of financial gain, commerce, luck, trickery and thieves.

Mercury was known to the greeks as hermes.  Hermes Trismagestrus means Hermes thrice great.  If Hermes and Mercury are the same, then Hermes thrice great = Mercury Mercury Mercury = HgHgHg.

Hermes Trismagestrus was thought to have known the three parts of the wisdom of the whole universe - Alchemy, Magic, and Astrology.  Alchemists turn things into gold.  

The number 3 is also symbolic of Abundance, or opportunity.

So either NYSE is saying that there's a lot of opportunity for financial gain, the only question is whether or not it's by buying GME, or milking the retail investors for all they've got.

Hg is also a private equity firm that targets buyouts primarily in Europe and the US.  So maybe they're saying their name 3 times in hopes they show up.

Some of you know I’m a big BB bull on $BB 

I love the stock, I love the company, I love John Chen, but it’s finally clear why BB has been moving the way it has, in tandem with GME 

Prem Watsa is a huge BB investor and owns a large stake 

Guess who Watsa has beef with? Steve Cohen, the guy supporting Melvin in GME, the final boss so to speak of Point72 with deep ties to Citadel  

[Watsa vs Cohen beef](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.theglobeandmail.com/amp/globe-investor/fairfax-e-mails-come-back-to-haunt-a-wall-street-titan/article571008/)

These are billionaires in financial warfare 

Steve Cohen’s tried to kill Watsa’s Fairfax fund. In turn killing Blackberry. Cohen’s group are the hostile players with MASSIVE capital that have been punishing BlackBerry for years 

It’s obvious now why BB SP has been so low in the market. It’s because Steve Cohen has tried to squash it due to his beef with Watsa. Same thing they’ve been doing with GameStop, but BlackBerry is more personal for Cohen 

Don’t believe me? Look at the daily chart for GME and BB 

GME had its first squeeze on Jan 13th, from $20 to $40. 100% gain. This was an astronomical loss for Melvin, who is backed by Cohen 

Guess when Blackberry began its epic run? Check the chart... Jan 14th, MASSIVE green candle 

December 22nd, random and short BB surge out of nowhere, was so random it shocked me as I thought it might even halt for news. The move faded. 

Check GME chart December 22nd, same day GME posted its first big power move from $16 to almost $20. Again Cohen group taking the edge of BB and moving it to GME. Clear as day now. 

This BB surge is Cohen’s group backing off their BB short, pushing the price up, and shoring up enough funds to move to GME which was hemorrhaging HUGE outflows. Retail and momentum exasperated this move in BB

This is so God damn obvious now in hindsight. This is why BB has been moving in tandem with GME 

This movement is not organic, has nothing to do with fundamentals, or even Blackberry itself!

This is a war between Cohen (Point72, Citadel, Melvin) and anonymous long hedge funds + retail. These anonymous long hedge funds are either using retail or are siding with retail. In the end, funds don’t give a shit about anything besides profit. So be careful, they don’t care about sending any message

Investing in BB right now is investing in Cohen losing his shirt in GME

I know I’ll get hated for this but it’s true and needs to be said 

CONSIDER: 

1) Deleverage, get off margin, don’t YOLO
2) Hedge with puts 
3) Scale some out 

You’re investing in between a financial tug of war that runs deep and is directly tied to the outcome of GME. You are not investing in fundamentals of BlackBerry right now! If Cohen uses political leverage which it looks like he has already, stabilizes his position in GME, he will go on the offensive and come back for blood in BB. Just be careful. This is crazy stuff.

Edit: LOL this place has gone wild and become an echo chamber.

So let me preface this by saying **BLNK** will not be the next **GME**. There will probably not be another **GME**. For starters it's not going to have an army of kids who used to shop there 15 years ago hyping it, not to mention over 100% short interest and the fact that in the early days it wasn't even 1b dollar market cap.. But it can a squeeze of it's own for it's own reasons entirely and so I have spent time looking beyond just the stock price movements which is what initially led me to start the idea of a **BLNK** DD. I do want to point out some things I noticed while the big squeeze started happening.

* A lot of companies with high short interest such as **IRBT** and **BLNK**, along with those more talked about companies such as **AMC** just started causing the shorts to cover all sorts of positions and move their money around. **BLNK** share price was up to about 65 dollars before falling down to 50 over the past 2 days. It has reached 55 dollars in the past so this wasn't even a squeeze it was just a few shorts deciding to cover their positions most likely because they were getting reamed elsewhere, or just a natural run up because people seem to really like **BLNK** stock. As a matter of fact, they like it so much that it is up *2400%* from 1 year ago. And it's still got relatively small market cap though we aren't in the millions anymore.
* If **BLNK** were to actually squeeze as hard as some of these other companies  have been and somehow reach **GME**'s current 20b dollar market cap it's share price would be $500 dollars. There are plenty of companies with 20 billion dollar market cap. If it just pulled an **AMC** and only jumped 200% in a day it would still be at 150 dollars. Of course if you believed **GME** squeezed already you're obviously mistaken yourself, but the sentence still applies that **BLNK** 10x would still leave it at only 20b market cap.

Is this realistic? Lets take a look at the ways in which **BLNK** is SETTING ITSELF UP to make money in the future, and I say that because as we go into details later you will realized they are currently not exactly succeeding financially, though when has that stopped a company from turning into a success in the past? We will also take a little bit of look at the short interest. Also, these are the kinds of companies who continue to gain more short interest as the price continues to rise.

Okay so **BLNK** is not some new company who just started because of the EV hype, **BLNK** has been a public company since only 2018 but has been a private company since 2008. They had a different name, but merged and acquired a few companies or something, and somehow ended up with the name **BLNK**. Many companies fight for years to break out of the depths of nothingness into a sound business model. According to their CEO: They design, manufacture, maintain, own, and operate charging stations. Their main business goal is to be the owner and operator, so they can be the fuel of the future. They put their focus on areas where you have no other choice but to use public charging.

**BLNK revenue comes from a few different things:**

* **Selling charging equipment:** They sell to third parties Okay, this is not great, but when you add the fact that they are **VERTICALLY INTEGRATED** it really changes the narrative a bit. **AAPL** just decided to go vertically integrated by designing building their own chips for their products, when you design your product and control the supply chain you can make greater strides to improving your margins and expanding your business through natural growth.
* **Utilization**: from people utilizing their charging stations, this is standard and easy to understand. They apparently pay about .12 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity and charge about .39 cents per kilowatt hour. These are pretty good margins and once more than 50% of the cars are the road become EVs this is going to grow exponentially. This will obviously take time but might not be as far away as people are trying to say either.
* **Network of charging stations:**  **BLNK** has it's own cloud based network which will collected *recurring* fees every month. It will also need to be managed, which is also recurring fees. This is also where shit gets interesting because they can use data integration of the network on top of utilization. Of course utilization is going to cost people money but what do we know about companies abilities to collect and sell data in the **AGE OF DATA**? We know that **DATA** is the next oil, that's something we do know, how long and how far will people go to learn your every move, where you charge your car, what stores you're nearby, for how long, etc. This data is will be worth money in time. (side note: **PLTR** LEAPS AFTER THE LOCKUP TARDS)

**BLNK Expansion, Growth, Partnerships, Deals, Future revenue streams**

* **BLNK** recently acquired BlueLA, an EV carsharing company. This was a big move for a little company with negative earnings and cash flow, the fact that they are acquiring things leads me to believe they are actively trying to expand, and beyond just chargers as well. They seem committed to take on the EV industry without being a car manufacturer.
* **BLNK** inked a deal with Cushman and Wakefield, for those of you who do not know they are a global commercial real estate services firm.
* International expansion. **BLNK** has a deal in Greece with **Nissan** to provide chargers to anyone who buys an electric **Nissan**. These people will get access to all of **BLNK**'s network. Let me inform you simpletons who have never left your moms basement, in other countries they are taking the whole EV movement more serious than America has been for some time, with certain countries already having pledged to ban gas powered cars by certain dates. I know the USA is making strides too and not to mention we have Elon but even if penetration is slow here it will not be slow internationally.
* **BLNK** announced on Dec. 15th it was signing an *exclusive* deal with Blessing Health System.
* When **BLNK** signs these types of exclusive deals it often times has contracts for 5-15 years to be the sole provider of charging within the property, this includes charging of all types of equipment not only electric cars.
* **BLNK** received a grant aimed at facilitating the deployment of 200 Blink Fast Level 2 - 19.2 kW charging stations across the mid-Atlantic region, including locations in Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia and Washington, DC. I smell more grants with incoming administration.
*  On 28th of July, **BLNK** and **ENS** entered an agreement  to jointly develop high-power wireless and enhanced DC (direct current for you actual retards) fast charging (DCFC) systems with integrated battery storage for the transportation market. This shows they are looking ahead and willing to work with whoever they need to stay on top of the technology. The resulting DCFC charging solution with high power energy storage will purportedly feature a modular design, and a power output from 100-500 kW. Supposedly it is going to be “economically priced”. They are going to look like the concrete parking guard things we see all over the place and they will be able to wireless charge certain vehicles is the idea.
* On the topic of DC chargers (non wireless). **TSLA** uses this same tech for it's superchargers. What else are DC chargers going to allow in the future? Bi directional charging! With bi-directional charging you can go Vehicle to Grid or Vehicle to Home . This means cars can one day be used to help balance energy needs by allowing EVs to charge during off peak hours and give back during peak hours. This is futuristic shit. Lots of stuff to be excited about. If you are confused and don't care about the future, all you need to know today is that direct current chargers have the converter in the charger itself, so they are bigger and faster at charging cars than the AC converters which have to have an onboard converter which converts AC into DC to feed the battery.  It is also going to lead to people to wanting and needing more advanced charging solutions in their home rather than using the ""well I can just charge over night"" logic with a slow level 1 charger. Having the charger do the conversion is the way of the future. This is the way.
* **VERTICAL INTEGRATION**. Did I fucking mention they are a vertically integrated charging company? This is huge. This needs reiteration. This means they design their own product plus build their own infrastructure out, not to mention provide own their own network, technicians, everything. It is very ambitious and nobody knows how far **BLNK** can take their business yet, but what we do know is that EVs are the future and it is still only the beginning of the EV revolution. Advantages of Vertical Integration include lower costs, faster getting products to consumers, less supply disruption or them raising the price on the company, less transportation costs and reduced delivery turnaround times, improved sales and profitability. I really think this is big to the companies growth trajectory yet it is not widely available information about the company.

**Some Other Points to Consider**

* Supposedly **BLNK** has the only 80 amp level 2 charging station currently on the market. Why does this matter to the small brained? That means it's faster than other chargers you say? Sure, that could be technically true, if that's what it was used for. Then why does it matter? Because **BLNK** chargers have **load-sharing capabilities**. The **BLNK** IQ 200 has the ability to load-share between 2 and 20 units from a single 100 amp feed. This is going to be a game changer for apartments, hospitals, any MUD's, honestly any commercial space that has access to a hundred amp feed. They will be able to service many cars with that single feed. But it gets better, the IQ 200 can intelligently share power, and even queue up cars that are plugged in but not charging, so that they can charge once other cars finish charging. **BLNK** envisions higher output being necessary to facilitate larger companies electric fleets, which we can now see happening in the EV space with trucks and couriers looking to go electric. 
* **BLNK**'s pricing scheme seems to be superior to that of **Chargepoint**. For those of you who do not know **Chargepoint** is another EV charging company, who was recently acquired by **SBE** and they are voting in February to finalize everything I believe. With **Chargepoint** they just sell the chargers to apartments and such and let them determine the pricing. They only manage the network. This means if you have to fill your battery up you have to constantly double check prices to see if you are getting reamed from one of their chargers vs another one. On **BLNK**'s network they will charge the same price everywhere. This is a huge plus in my eyes. I am a little unclear which policy would be in effect for chargers that **BLNK** does not have on it's network, because as I've said it does sell equipment as well.
* **BLNK** has mobile chargers with the same power as their IQ 200 but in a mobile factor in case you run out of fuel on the road.
* **BLNK** does not give a shit to what kind of car you drive, it wasn't to fuel all electric vehicles of the future.
* Fleets are coming, **BLNK** seems ready for this.
* **BLNK** can have partnerships with and target the following sectors which we already see some starting to play out: Parking & Services, Commercial & Residential, Workplace, Healthcare, Education, Retail, Hospitality/Food & Beverage, Entertainment, Governmental.
* Consumer stores that add EV charging stations tend to see costumers staying in their stores longer according to data which I have not seen. This reiterates the point about being able to collect money from data.
* So you may or may not know that in the USA **TSLA** still owns about 80% market share of EVs. We also know this will not last forever as every car company and their mother's boyfriend on top of car companies we've never even heard of are all on the EV bandwagon right now. This is going to make a lot of cars that need charging stations and it will be impossible for any one company to win this battle we can safely assume there will be 2-4 major players.
* Low estimates are expecting the amount of charging stations in America to jump from between a quarter and a half million now, depending on if you are counting Gen 1, to low estimates stating there will be between 13 and 14 million charging stations over the next 7 or 8 years.

**The Possible Concerns that keep getting thrown around**

* **BLNK** seems to be issuing more public shares from time to time (yes, dilution) but we know that when a company is trying to raise capital to expand this is a common strategy, and I don't really think is something to be worried about as long as you believe EV's are really going to be the future. I do.
* **BLNK**'s owner and CEO Michael D Farkas sold shares last month, to the tune of 22 million dollars worth. This always makes companies look bad but many people who own and operate a business would scrape some off the top to support their family in case things don't go according to plan, not everyone is an Elon (and Elon was still set before **TSLA** lets be real), doesn't mean he is necessarily up to no good. Not to mention if shorts were attacking you with even shorter shorts every day would it not worry you a bit that they win? This is an ongoing battle for small companies that don't get along with Wall Street. Plus, he still has 6.7 million shares, he only sold about 540,000 for 22 million dollars. This is a drop in the bucket and the man should not be faulted for this, my opinion is that it is no warning sign.
* This might end up being a competitive space that could lower margins and cause financial hardships for the company. This is an actual concern. It could also take a lot longer than people are expecting to achieve meaningful penetration fully electric cars. I do think **BLNK** being poised to expand internationally will help them offset some of this.
* EV is just a bubble blah blah blah blah okay then don't buy any EV stocks, you might be right but you're also a little bitch.

**BACK TO SHORT SHORTS**

&#x200B;

So if the last data I see on yahoo says that that the float is around 27 or 28 million. This is what's not held by insiders, who are unlikely to sell right now due to the fact that everyone knows we are collectively fucking over people who traditionally fuck them over. If a few weeks ago there was 8.8 million shares shorted and the average daily trading volume as of last week close was 14,263,640. This would make it a modest  .61 days to cover. While it's no **GME**, I do believe this is a pretty large short ratio. Especially when you consider how small the public float is. I do believe this situation will be amplified the further **BLNK** moves away from it's ""valuation."" Also with what we've seen this week these people are willing to double down on things because apparently maybe they are just as retarded as we are. 

So **BLNK**'s short interest is increasing at a rate of about 20% per every 20 dollars the stock rises. This is only a simple estimate based off of quick calculations but you can see that Dec. 15 the stock price was 28 dollars and amount of shares shorted was 6.18 million. On Jan 15th  the share price was $47 and the total amount of shares sold short were 8.8 million. That's about 23%. As of right now it's still less than a day to cover but that does not mean we can't see things get frothy from this point on. Most people think **BLNK**'s chance of success sit somewhere around the 0-3% mark I'd estimate based on the general sentiment not only here on WSB but also anywhere else on the internet you look. The consensus seems to be to stay away from it.

Months back some shady research company probably wrote a hit piece on **BLNK** causing it's share price to tank nearly 50%, it had no real substance, none of the claims were found to have any evidence of being true and it is being investigated by the SEC and such, This same company ran an inaccurate hit piece on **CLSK** some time ago. Culper Research is the name if you'd like to look it up and read the hit piece. **BLNK** managed to defeat the shorts that time but will they again? 

Did I mention who else hates **BLNK** charging? **SHITRON** himself. Here's a quote from the shitman himself back in November:

Shitron said, ""**BLNK**’s valuation makes no sense"" and called the company a “total scheme.” Left said it is “insulting” to call **BLNK** an EV stock.

“New most ridiculous EV stock is $**BLNK**. No $$ for R&D, management accused of securities fraud, no real revenues,” Shitron tweeted.

This goes without saying but every word that comes out of that mans mouth is horse shit. You know this. At this point, literally the whole world knows this. It's not even a question of does he write things based off of any evidence, we all know he would only say negative things that are to cause companies to go down because he has a position shorting them. Does he still have a position? Who knows, but we can safely assume at least at one point he did.

**I try not to use the** ***F*** **word but here goes a bit of simple** ***Fundamentals*** **for you tards:**

Current market cap: **1.85b** Don't need to remind you guys this is still tiny and can still go through some explosive growth at a market cap this small in todays world with the amount of retail investors that throw their money at the most retarded shit you could ever possibly think of, for reference look at **NKLA**. Pretty sure **NKLA** reached a 20b dollar market cap at one point.

**BLNK** has negative earnings per share, and although their revenue is increasing a good amount from quarter to quarter and beating expectations they only earned about 2.26 million last quarter. 

Last quarter GAAP EPS: -.12

Operating Income: -3.50 M

Profit margin: -285.81% 

Return on Equity: -97.33% This tells you how well they are spending their money. 

Yes those are negatives. Impressive, to say the least.

As a matter of fact just about everything you read about this company screams ""***SHORT ME!***"" Think about how many rich powerful scumbags are trying to run this company into the ground. Are they right? Or is EV charging just the future that has not come yet!? What I take from this is that they are spending every dollar they have trying to make it. This is all or nothing for this company. 

**Final Thoughts**

Can we think of any other companies with negative earnings per share that still ended up being great success stories? It's almost like that hasn't been the blueprint for the past 10 years now.. Will it work? Only time will tell. But it definitely will not if these short sellers have their way with it. Also for reference just look at **QS**'s 16b dollar market cap and they don't even have a product. **BLNK** at least has products that are currently going out into the world to be used. Of course the real move could just be puts on **QS,** but I stay out of bear territory especially during bull feeding frenzies. My outlook is that Billions are just the Millions of some years ago, especially when we're printing Trillions out of thin air (Obligatory shout out to the printer man himself **JPOW**). Just remember that we live in a brave new world where kids with phone apps can invest in what they believe the future is going to look like.

Lastly, this is a stock no one has restricted trading to yet, allowing people to buy more than 2-3 shares could seriously cause **BLNK** to quadruple in value. We've seen how fast small market cap companies can jump when millions of autists all buy shares at the same time. Strength in numbers. The revolution of the retail investor has only begun my friends.

Remember I'm just a retard not a financial advisor so this is not advice or anything but I'll let my positions speak for themselves:

**GME** 500 c jan 29 (RIP I TRIED TO IGNITE THE INFINITE GAMMA SQUEEZE GUYS, I DID MY PART AND BOUGHT THAT SHIT ON THURSDAY, GUESSING IF 500C WENT IN THE MONEY IT WAS GOING TO IGNITE A DOMINO EFFECT, I TRIED AND FAILED BUT I LOVE YOU ALL, BUYING MORE SHARES ON MONDAY)

&#x200B;

TLDR: **BLNK** is the only vertically integrated EV charging company, **BLNK** has international presence, **BLNK** shares are up 2400% in the past year. It will take .61 days to cover and this number DEFINITELY rising, very small amount of float available, Shitron hates **BLNK**, so do all other short sellers, make no mistake they have put the hit out on **BLNK** and would love to see it run into the ground, **BLNK** is small enough to still rocketship pretty hard, **GME** to the moon."|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|['BLNK', 'DD']|[]|['I', 'EXTRA', 'GME', 'GME', 'BLNK', 'I', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'TTING', 'TSELF', 'UP', 'I', 'EV', 'BLNK', 'CALLY', 'AGE', 'OF', 'LEAPS', 'AFTER', 'THE', 'OCKUP', 'BLNK', 'LA', 'EV', 'EV', 'EV', 'I', 'USA', 'W', 'DC', 'I', 'DC', 'DCFC', 'W', 'DC', 'DC', 'AC', 'AC', 'DC', 'I', 'TICAL', 'I', 'EV', 'I', 'IQ', 'IQ', 'EV', 'EV', 'I', 'I', 'IQ', 'EV', 'I', 'USA', 'EV', 'I', 'I', 'CEO', 'D', 'I', 'EV', 'EV', 'BACK', 'TO', 'SHORT', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'WSB', 'SEC', 'I', 'EV', 'EV', 'D', 'I', 'GAAP', 'M', 'SHORT', 'ME', 'EV', 'I', 'QS', 'I', 'RIP', 'I', 'TRIED', 'TO', 'GNITE', 'THE', 'INITE', 'GAMMA', 'UEEZE', 'GUYS', 'I', 'DID', 'MY', 'PART', 'AND', 'OUGHT', 'THAT', 'SHIT', 'ON', 'RSDAY', 'SSING', 'IF', 'C', 'WENT', 'IN', 'THE', 'MONEY', 'IT', 'WAS', 'GOING', 'TO', 'GNITE', 'A', 'OMINO', 'FFECT', 'I', 'TRIED', 'AND', 'AILED', 'BUT', 'I', 'LOVE', 'YOU', 'ALL', 'UYING', 'MORE', 'HARES', 'ON', 'EV', 'ITELY']|['GME', 'GME']

If you are absolutely  new to stocks and options, you should start with likes of Investopedia  to learn basic mechanics and greeks. This post will focus on a little  less obvious things.

**1) I sold options and they became In the money. When will I get assigned?**

Technically,  you can get assigned at any moment since you’ve sold it. But if there  is any extrinsic value of an option contract (if your option is trading  higher than the difference between the strike price and the current  market price of a stock) it will almost never be exercised before  expiry. Watch out for these two events, though: hostile takeovers and  dividend trigger (if the dividend payed is higher than extrinsic value).  Well, also watch out for drunk idiots who exercise by mistake.

**2) It’s expiry day. At what time will I get assigned?**

Most  often Option Clearing Corporation will trigger automatic assignment of  any ITM options, unless other is configured by the client in his  brokerage. The default automatic exercises and assignments processing  time is 16:00 pm Eastern Time. However, the OCC permits client manual  exercise decisions for until 17:30 EST.

**3) At 16:00 my sold options have expired worthless. Am I good?**

No,  as mentioned above – if the price in after hours moves and makes your  options ITM, they can still be assigned until 17:30. Especially be  cautious in the days of earnings or days when 13F are published —  those  can move asset prices after hours quite a bit.

**4) Can I buy or sell options before/after hours?**

No,  generally you can’t. The exceptions are very select instruments. Also,  some brokers offer exclusive packages and allow you to trade options  outside regular hours, but you will be, basically, trading with the  broker himself.

**5) How options and stocks are taxed if I exercise or get assigned?**

Options  premiums are added or subtracted to/from the base price of the stock.  Say, you bought calls strike price 100, for 10$ premium. On the day of  expiry the price of your stock has gone up to 200, Your calls are now  worth 100$, but you still believe that the stock price can go even  higher, you would prefer to own and hold that stock. You can sell those  call contracts and be taxed for profits of 90$ per contract. But if you  exercise your contracts, your base price will be 110$ per contract and  your profit will be your future sale price minus 110$. Works in a  similar way with puts, and short positions in options.

*Disclaimer*: this might not be accurate for all jurisdictions and accounts. This is not an accounting advise, please contact professionals!

**6) Why my options are losing value even though the underlying stock went in my direction (up for calls, down for puts)?**

Options  prices are more complex than simply tracking the performance of a  stock. Again, it is useful to learn the greeks. But to start, you should  understand two most useful aspects: time decay and Implied Volatility.  If you have short term expiring Out of the money options, their price  will decline even if the price of a stock goes in your direction, but  not fast enough.

Implied  Volatility can be described as market sentiment and expectancy of price  changes. The higher is the belief that the price will change – the more  expensive are the options (especially with low delta). For example, If  you bought calls after 3 days of insane volatility, but then the next  weeks it moved up for only 1 or 2%, your calls will likely not gain, but  rather lose value, because you bough them at the peak of IV, and since  the volatility seemingly settled down, the market no longer expects huge  moves and is no longer eager to pay big premium for your options.

There  can be also so-called unusual activity. That’s basically large amounts  of purchases of some particular options outstanding against the general  flow. Those events can change premiums for a period of time too and  often indicate a start of a new trend.

**7) Can I do a Poor Man Covered Call on a cash account?**

Poor  Man Covered Call is a strategy of selling OTM calls but having a deep  ITM call as a hedge. It imitates covered calls strategy. Some people  assume, that since this strategy caps your downside risk, this will be  allowed on a cash account. This is false. Cash accounts allow no naked  options selling, even if your max loss is caped.

**8) What is Settled cash and Free Riding Rule?**

Most  trades have settling periods. For stocks it is T+2 (the day you traded +  2 business days) and for most options it’s the next day. This means,  that if you sold something, the cash is not immediately delivered to  your account. Brokers will still allow you to buy with unsettled cash.  This is called Free Riding. But if you sell anything you bought with  unsettled cash — they will give you a 90 days restriction for violation  of Free Riding Rule. This is very uncomfortable.

This applies only to cash accounts.

**9) If I added to a position under Free Riding Rule, can I still sell if I’m within limits of what I bought before?**

No.  For example, if you had 100 shares for a long time, but bought 10 more  shares under Free Riding, even if you then sell only 1 share before cash  is settled, you will still get a 90 day restriction. At least on most  brokers that I know.

**10) Can I sell covered calls when I have 0$ settled cash on cash account?**

Not  on all brokers. Some brokers will treat selling covered calls as if you  are using formal 0% margin. And since you have 0$ settled cash, your  cash doesn’t exceed your 0% margin. Sounds moronic, but that’s how it  works. You might be caught in this situation if you are rolling covered  calls on a cash account: you buyback those contracts, get bellow your  settled cash and then can’t sell new covered calls until next business  day.

**11) How to save on commissions if I’m not using a commission-free broker?**

Some  brokers allow you to configure your orders with numerous options. First  of all, don’t use their smart algorithms or any kinds of quirky  ‘special sauces’ - 9 times out of 10 you will get both worse execution  and bigger commissions. Secondly, if configurable, always ask for an  All-or-None orders.  This will ensure that your order will be much more  likely filled from one source and on one exchange, thus minimizing your  commission. Finally, there are exchanges that offer traders rebates for  added liquidity. For example NYSE Arca (PSE) and BATS offer rebates to  customers for added liquidity in options trading. Yes, you will get a  cashback for your trades. Configure destination of your orders to select  those exchanges. Note: some brokers will provide those rebates to their  users and some will just take it themselves. Note 2: rebates are  offered for adding liquidity; for removing liquidity you will still get  charged.

Hope this helps! Feel free to write your questions if you have some. And good luck with your trades!"|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'ITM', 'OCC', 'EST', 'I', 'ITM', 'F', 'I', 'I', 'IV', 'I', 'OTM', 'ITM', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'NYSE', 'BATS']|[]

I've been doing a lot of research and thinking today about where we're at right now and where do we go from here and I wanted to get it all written out for my own sake but I also might as well share with you guys.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Let me start off by saying that I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I an expert but I do follow the markets closely and I do listen to the experts.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I believe that due to a number of factors that I will outline in this post that we could see a liquidity crisis in the next 1-4 weeks. Now before you start calling me a gay bear please hear me out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As you retards have been yolo'ing FD's this has gamma squoze the shit out of the market. This is great until the market rolls over and the same dynamic goes against you. When prices go down, the MM's sell the shares they were using as a delta hedge and that makes prices go down faster.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What happened this week with RH and others halting trading on the meme names was a liquidity issue. RH drew down their $500M credit line and borrowed another $1B last week to try and keep up with you guys! Massive call buying causes the VIX to go up. VIX going up means the hedge funds, clearing houses and brokerage firms aren't allowed to operate on as much leverage. Low VIX = Leverage good, High Vix = Leverage Bad. If the VIX stays up all of these entities are going to have to sell off their positions to meet their collateral requirements. GME has more shares short than actually exist so if enough autist hold then they will never be able to fully cover. What happens then?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

High VIX means everybody needs to deleverage their positions which means stonks go down :(

There is a pending liquidity problem here. If you look at the chart of GDX for example you will see it always seems to diverge downward from SPY whenever there is a pending liquidity event. In general you would expect to see the TLT go up when the VIX goes up. More volatility means you want to flee to the safety of bonds right? Instead what we're seeing is TLT down while VIX is up. It's my view that TLT will come up and join the VIX very shortly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now I'd like to point out that I'm not a gay bear, I'm a bull at heart. The thing is that if we can be prepared for the crash that's coming we can BTFD so hard. If we have nothing at the bottom then there is no money to BTFD!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

On Friday we saw stocks sell off to their weekly lows,  the VIX was quite high and bond yields were at their all time low. Low bond yields means people are not hedging their portfolios and / or they're selling bonds to cover their margin requirements. The hedge funds are now concerned that if the market continues to go down they will need to start to deleverage. There is more margin and call options out there right now than there has ever been. This is where that reverse gamma squeeze screws you over. This could cause a fast, sharp move lower. Think March 2020.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In the treasury market last week the short term treasury yields fell to all time lows. Short interest for everyday stocks are at alltime lows. Put option volumes are at all time lows. As prices start going down, market participants realize they need to hedge their bets and so they buy puts. MM's short the stock in order to hedge their put sale and this is where the gamma squeeze to the downside exacerbates the move downward.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even mutual funds are record long equity and record underweight bonds. As the market rolls over they will also need to sell equities to get into fixed income.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If you look at the SPY yearly chart there is bearish divergence over the past 2 months. What does that mean? RSI has been trending downwards will price has been continuing upwards. This is an indicator of a market trend reversal. The DMARK is also hitting daily, weekly, monthly and yearly high. This is very bearish as well. These signals don't necessarily mean that something that will for sure happen but it is pointing out that there is tons of risk in the system.

&#x200B;

Now look at the Covid situation throughout the world. It is calming down somewhat but the problem is we're seeing new fast spreading strains of the virus that could easily turn the situation for the worse very quickly. This could lead to more shut downs which effects the economy and the market. So this begs the question, are all of these companies optimistic reflation projections realistic? What happens if / when they miss earning estimates?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So what do we do about this? First and foremost HOLD YOUR GME, AMC + BB shares. They might be the only stonks that goes up this week / month. Assuming you're not all in on GME, what do you do with your other money? Spy puts, TLT calls and Gold are where you want to be if you buy my idea that this could be March 2020 all over again.  I know these are all gay bear moves. Feel free to disagree with me in the comments!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Be careful out there guys!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** The market looks quite risky right now for a number of reasons. Could potentially be like last March. Hold your GME shares, hedge the crash with everything else.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Positions: GME Shares + SLV Calls + Cash, buying TLT Calls and Spy puts tomorrow.

&#x200B;

This report will discuss the current and future state of Blackberry Ltd (“**Blackberry**”) and its business viability. Too long has the cycle of research been held in the hands of big banks that are incentivized to publish aggressive price targets at the point of a transaction. Too long have buy-side institutions been caged inside an investment parameter that is geared towards accumulating capital than growing it.

We will be discussing Blackberry’s product suite and its defensibility in their respective ecosystems, what value Blackberry brings to the world and various valuation metrics to justify a price target of over CAD$100.

The Blackberry product suite is largely deployed in hi-tech environments with sophisticated buyers seeking the highest security uncompromising in the sight of an indelicate user interface. This includes both its cybersecurity and QNX platforms.

QNX is vital to the self-driving ecosystem and will be the de-facto operating system at the point of multiple catalysts. This includes the first approved autopilot system in any jurisdiction, the first cybersecurity attack on a connected vehicle non QNX related and diamond handed people in WSB.

**ALL WE NEEDED TO KEEP TRADING WAS AN INFUSION OF $7.5B!!!!!!!**

But, u/clash_jeremy, that's so much money! NO IT ISN'T. The US Government ran a deficit of **$3.1T** last year to keep the whole system going. The Fed added close to **$3T** to their asset sheets to keep the whole system going. So, when it came time to keep the system going for the retail investor, **THEY LOOKED THE OTHER WAY!!!!!**

One of the main duties of the Fed and Treasury is to ensure liquidity in all markets. THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT WE NEEDED WEDNESDAY-FRIDAY of last week.

But, what if they didn't know this was coming. Yeah, convenient alibi if the CEO for DTCC wasn't literally an advisor for the Federal Reserve and the FDIC!

**TLDR = HOLD GME for as long as you can this DD is for AFTER the squeeze, once out get your money into PUTS.**

I wanted to bring you some DD that I have been working on but first let me get something out of the way.  I am tired of all the stock talk and we need to get back to some old school DD so we know where to YOLO our GME returns AND talk about options again.  I do not recommend getting out GME for any reason for the below.  This is what I think is occurring now and over the next few months, or faster, pending the severity of the situation.  If the situation is as severe as u/johnnydaggers & u/vinlo make it look then this could happen A LOT faster.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀GME TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

The unfortunate part is I am a bull by nature, always have been.  This write-up is extremely bearish in nature but before calling me a 🏳️‍🌈🐻it is only because of the unique situation us glorious folk has put us in with uncovering a massive issue with the market.

What is going on now is starting to look a lot like 2008/09.  I believe that the HF's got caught so bad with their naked short selling that there is literally no way to unwind the damage that they are doing.  For some reference PLEASE read this post as I believe this is the catalyst to what I am posting below.  I was missing a piece but tonight I believe I found it:

[u/johnnydaggers & u/vinlo naked short selling write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9jbc5/listen_to_me_we_cannot_trust_the_short_interest/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I started looking at the 08/09 housing crash and then it hit me that the VW squeeze was also occurring around this time.  So what I wanted to see was how much liquidity came out of the market between the squeeze and the housing crisis.  **Can you believe the VW squeeze dropped the market more than the housing crisis?**  The below SPY chart goes from 7/1/2008 to somewhere mid-April.

* You can see that just after the squeeze started the entire market started to dump.  This most likely had to with liquidity and all the same issues we are seeing now
* The VW squeeze dropped the SPY 37% in about 6 weeks
* There was then a 26% rebound during the **peak** of the short squeeze - This tells me the people that were screwed in this one were consolidating liquidity and once they had an idea of what was going on moved into buying calls prior to shorting the market and exacerbating the housing collapse.
* The entire market was still trending down after this rebound until the lowest of lows of the housing market crash

Here is what piqued my interest.  The VW squeeze dropped the SPY **37%** from beginning to end, and the entire housing crisis dropped SPY **28%**?  **HOW IS THIS EVEN REMOTELY POSSIBLE?**

[I eat chalk, not crayons, they taste better.](https://preview.redd.it/4gzqdeml6re61.png?width=1478&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf799e7b86ec26b0b6afcefdf241cb1b48131306)

So I take this info and now look at the current SPY chart and see what GME is doing to the overall market.  This is where we are now:

If we apply some basic math the correct on the market could be somewhere in the 240s.  Yes, I know how crazy that sounds but I believe this to be the beginning of the bubble popping.  We exposed a HUGE crack in the foundation and I think it is only going to get worse especially if any of the additional data provided above is accurate.  If it is then we could be looking at a correction closer to the 45% overall range in the next 6-9 months.

My plays:

GME TO THE MOON - Mix of options and shares and riding this into VALHALLA

As for the bullshit above I am going to be going with:

315P (4-6 Weeks out)

200/250p range or both EOY

I am not a financial advisor, I don't know anything about anything.  I like stonks like GME and this is my very biased mostly retarded fully autistic opinion.

I have been around WSB for years under this username and my other, less anonymous one. Check my other posts to confirm I am not hedgie agent scum.

Now, to the unpopular part: a word of caution. I see a lot of DD around here analyzing the short interest, the $GME public float, and theories about what that means for the trading price of the stock. Yes, we like the stock. HOWEVER, all of this DD fails to consider one very important variable – the authorized but unissued shares of $GME.

If you look at $GME’s articles of incorporation (this is the document that gives a company its corporate existence and, among other things, states the number of shares the company is authorized to issue), you will see that $GME is authorized to issue up to 300,000,000 shares. Currently it looks like there are about 70,000,000 shares outstanding depending on whose number you go with. So, theoretically, the board of directors of $GME could issue three times the number of shares that are currently outstanding today.

Is the board going to do that? Your guess is as good as mine. On one hand, the board is certainly not going to go out of their way to help out a bunch of hedge funds that were trying to total screw them over and drive them into the ground. But on the other hand, the board has a fiduciary obligation to act in the best interests of the shareholders of the company. If they can raise a bunch of money selling stock at a $300+ price level, they have to legally consider it. This could significantly improve their balance sheet by allowing them to take out debt with the cash proceeds from a very rich equity sale.

So, could they easily issue more shares? The answer is yes. In December, the company filed an automatic shelf registration statement. This allows them to, essentially at any time and very quickly register a follow-on public equity sale. You can bet your ass that these shorts have been making calls into the company to see what the appetite would be in taking this route, which could allow them to get out of their positions for substantially less than would be the case if they had to cover in the secondary market (because, diamond hands, of course).

Now a couple of good things, even if the board wanted to do this, it seems very risky for all concerned. I think we all know that after the squeeze is done, hitting whatever price it is going to hit ($1,000, $10,000, $42,069???), eventually the price is going to come back to land (could be a week, a month, a year, who knows). When that happens, selling stock at a hugely inflated value based on earning performance (note that I have argued the price today of $GME is totally supported for economic reasons) is going to invite lawsuits galore, so perhaps the board (Which is risk averse by nature) doesn’t want to make a move without letting things settle out. Time will tell. Also, all of this free press has to be a boon for business and I have to believe that the board sees what happened with Robinhood (aka Robbin’ Gainz) where they totally disenfranchised their whole user base in a single day and saw the valuable lesson there. Thus, this is another reason that the $GME board probably won’t issue more shares to screw over the WSB investors, many of whom are their target market.

All that said, I want to see the $GME rocket broaching interstellar space like the rest of you MONKEs.🦍🍌🚀🌖🌖🌖🌖

Also, need to give some love to the rest of the $BANG stocks, $BB, $AMC, and $NOK. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Let’s hope the $GME board also has diamond hands and lets this ship fly!!!!!
💎👋🚀🌖

Edit 1: Tl;dr I predict 💎👋🦍🍌🚀🚀🚀🚀🌖, but there is a risk that the company refuels our ship prematurely.

Edit 2: I will qualify my comments by acknowledging the fact that the NYSE does have a “20% Rule” which generally requires shareholder approval for a NYSE-listed company from issuing more than 20% of its outstanding, so that is a real constrain as well. There are some exceptions to this, but no one wants to read more about this."|2021-02-01 11:35:34.523361|../output/raw/2021/02/01/DueDiligence_flair_DD_113536.csv|DueDiligence|['$GME']|['GME']|['I', 'I', '$GME', 'I', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'DD', '$GME', 'WEVER', 'DD', '$GME', '$GME', '$GME', 'I', 'I', '$GME', 'I', '$GME', 'WSB', 'I', '$GME', '$BANG', '$BB', '$AMC', '$NOK', '$GME', 'I', 'I', 'NYSE']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'GME']

**ADM and Future for Sustainable Agriculture and Cost Reduction**

Ok, supposedly everyone cares about sustainable business models and the environment nowadays. Which they should. But sometimes it is a little more complicated than just buying an electric vehicle. Food production is a massive contributor to global CO2 emissions. See: [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507104446.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507104446.htm) (TLDR: Soybean trade is bad for the environment.)

Soybean and Corn is currently processed for animal feed. But guess what, you can create animal feed with minimal land, space and water. How? The answer is insect protein.

&#x200B;

Insect Protein Animal Feed Industry

Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and InnovaFeed plan to begin building what will be the world’s largest insect protein facility in 2021 in the city of Decatur in central Illinois.

PROS:

\- Black soldier fly larvae eat non-compostable food waste bound for landfills + produce hundreds of times more protein per acre than traditional animal feed sources. This will be attractive to the public with the growing consciousness of environmental sustainability.

\- Current animal feed is sourced from soybean meal and corn meal. The massive quantities of corn and soybean farming requires large amounts of land and water. Insects can be grown indoors, requiring far less land and water.

\- **Not only does the farming of insects decrease CO2 emissions in itself, these insects eat and feed on WASTE. This food processing decreases CO2 emissions AND reduces landfill waste.**

CONS:

\- Insect food processing is still not cost competitive with traditional animal feed; however, innovation and sustainability always comes with a cost.

# TLDR

\- ADM is currently holding 10% less market cap while trading at a lower P/E and P/S. (Compared to CTVA, it's biggest competitor.)

\- ADM provides 2x the annual dividend (Compared to CTVA, its biggest competitor.) AKA BOOMERS LIKE DIS STOCK TOO.

\- ADM shows consistent (although slow) year over year growth. Current financials do not project ADM to be a growth stock. I believe this what causes it to trade at such a low price to earnings ratio (50% lower than market average); however, I believe their initiative for a more sustainable business model will change this in the long term.

\- Insect farming reduces required land and water. You can literally raise these in a small indoor facility anywhere in the world...or even the moon 🚀 🚀 . Insect farming has potential to be much cheaper than current business models. Insect farming reduces CO2 emissions and they feed for landfill waste. You can grow feed for livestock while reducing the amount of landfill waste AND reducing CO2 emissions.

Positions: I am only holding shares at the moment. As we are seeing a current market pull back, I will most likely enter LEAPS 1/20/2023 $55C.

## What Exactly Happened at Robinhood This Week?

There has been plenty of speculation this week about what exactly went down and unverified (although reasonable) rumors on why Robinhood did this. I’ll go over the top two theories before taking a deep dive into the “official” reason given by Robinhood.

[**Pressure from the White House and Sequoia according to a Robinhood employee**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/l723kf/robinhood_insider_information/)

This statement has been [refuted by Sequoia](https://www.newsweek.com/sequoia-capitol-denies-pressuring-robinhood-stop-gamestop-trading-after-viral-reddit-post-1565269). I personally wouldn’t believe the Sequoia part since I don’t really know what they would gain from it - they’re a Venture Capital firm, not a hedge fund, and would not be actively shorting stocks let alone be trading in stocks. It could be possible that the White House, or someone from the government did contact Robinhood - actually, I’d be pretty shocked if no one called them at some point this week to ask wtf was going on.During this call, they may have been afraid that GameStop’s short squeeze would have triggered a major financial crisis due to hedge funds collapsing and de-grossing, causing a mass selloff similar to what was seen in 2008 and in March 2020 - I’ll talk more about this later. Basically, without Robinhood shutting down GME from being bought, it’s actually very possible we would have seen the rest of the stock market collapse last week, and this was something the Biden administration was trying to make sure didn’t happen in the first month in office.

**Possible intervention from Citadel Securities**

This was a theory I personally believed in initially and would have been a very obvious area of scrutiny for many people. The most straightforward one being the fact that Citadel (the hedge fund) dumped a few billion into Melvin to bail it out a [few days ago](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340), who were the very well known shorts of GME. Citadel, the hedge fund, is owned by Citadel LLC, which happens to also run Citadel Securities - a market maker. If you don’t know what this is, go grow a few brain wrinkles and read my [previous post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ygab/dddd_how_rwallstreetbets_created_a_financial/). Citadel Securities is effectively Robinhood’s sugar daddy, directly being responsible for around [40% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/a-controversial-part-of-robinhoods-business-tripled-in-sales-thanks-to-high-frequency-trading-firms.html) in 2018 through their payment for order flow (i.e. selling your trades to Citadel, giving them the right of first refusal, and [potentially giving you a worse price](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321); this is how they get 0% commission trades btw).

Theoretically, Citadel the hedge fund and Citadel the market maker is run independently and sister companies both owned by Citadel LLC, but anyone can see this being a potential conflict of interest. There’s also a possibility that Citadel Securities losing billions of dollars being short so many GME calls (they write 99% of all options contracts) and probably not being perfectly Gamma and (especially) Vega hedged, so when those two greeks skyrocketed on GME they probably lost tons of money there. [According to WSB hero Chamath](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354947541125611526), he didn’t invest in Robinhood when they came to him on multiple occasions because he thought the founders lacked integrity, implying he believes they might have been the type of people to sell out their users (granted, they already literally do this) and do this type of shit.

**The Official Reason - Clearing House Limitations**

Let’s get to the [official reason put out by Robinhood](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility), which is that their clearing house, in this case the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, suddenly increased their collateral requirements on GME trades drastically. Apparently, **Robinhood is running out of cash**, so they weren’t able to provide the cash collateral demanded by DTCC, and hence weren’t able to trade through them. Let’s dumb this down and talk about how brokerages work.

Let’s talk about what a clearing house is and how they work. Imagine Bob wants to sell Dylan a share of GME. There’s a bunch of legal paperwork and logistics for actually transferring over the share, which can take a few days to finalize - this is called settlement. However, you don’t want people being able to back out of this exchange during this process for obvious reasons, so that’s where the clearing house comes in. Let’s call this clearing house Mary. What Mary does is facilitate (clear) this exchange, and ensures both Bob and Dylan follow through with their trade by having them both immediately give Mary cash as collateral while the exchange settles. If one party was no longer able to meet their end of the exchange (eg. Dylan goes bankrupt), Mary acts as an insurer and is responsible for buying the share from Bob instead. If it turned out that Bob was lying about actually owning a share and can't transfer it over to Dylan in time (failure to deliver), Mary is responsible for finding that share for him instead.

Since GME suddenly became very volatile, and the financial soundness of some parties and their ability to deliver their side of the trade have been suddenly called into question ([at least on the seller’s side](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)), DTCC decided  (...or due to pressure from other sources?) to increase the collateral needed for buying GME to be more than 10x of the proportion of the market value of whatever it was before. Most brokerages reacted to this by disabling margin trading. For some reason, Robinhood went one step further and disabled trading for all accounts, possibly due to their relatively small cash reserves compared to places like Fidelity, and the relatively large number of users who use margin in the platform.

## What’s Robinhood Going To Do About GME?

Robinhood’s decision to stop purchases of GME basically got hate from literally everyone, to the point where it somehow united the country in a beautiful way. Here’s a list of things that happened as a result of Robinhood’s decision, for fun

* [Ted Cruz retweeted AOC saying he completely agreed with her](https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905)
* [Protests at NYSE and Robinhood HQ](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/protesters-gather-at-robinhood-hq-nyse-in-response-to-restricted-stock-trades)
* [Class action lawsuit](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/investing/lawsuit-robinhood-gamestop-wallstreetbets/index.html)
* [Someone paid to have an airplane](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rlyx/this_guy_is_flying_a_banner_saying_suck_my_nuts/) fly around the Bay Area over Robinhood’s office saying “Suck my nuts Robinhood”
* [Angry Robinhood employees were given DoorDash credits for some reason?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7y5ka/robinhood_staff_unhappy_about_the_trading_hault/)
* [Congressional investigation to Robinhood’s decision](https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-job-posting-federal-affairs-congress-hearing-gamestop-reddit-2021-1)
* [SEC investigation to Robinhood’s decision](https://www.cnet.com/news/robinhood-troubles-sec-will-closely-review-actions-that-restricted-amc-gamestop-stock-trades/)

Clearly, this decision has single-handedly made Robinhood the most hated company in the world right now. It’s especially bad given the optics - their mission is to literally “democratize finance”, with the idea of empowering individual retail investors to be on the same level of institutions. This decision, whether intentional or not, has literally gone against everything about Robinhood’s image and mission, and will end the company if not fixed soon. **All of this right as Robinhood is planning to launch their IPO**.

The people in charge of Robinhood likely know all of this and are doing everything they can to find cash and liquidity to put up the collateral needed to resume GME trading. So far we’ve seen them raise $1B from investors and $500M through lines of credit overnight, although based on the fact that GME is still restricted, that doesn’t seem to be enough. However, in my personal opinion, I think it's likely that Robinhood is doing everything they can to find more money given the situation, and once they do, **they will likely re-enable trading on GME. If that happens (which IMO will probably be some time next week), GME and all other high-SI stocks will absolutely** 🚀🌝\*\*.\*\*

## How GME Almost Caused (and Still Can Cause) a Stock Market Crash

Let’s go over something else interesting that went on as a result of the GME short squeeze - the fact that it started to affect the stock market overall. In fact, the stock market had the largest decline since October across all sectors on Wednesday when GME, AMC, and other high-SI stocks surged, with a very sharp recovery as the meme stocks fell after Robinhood suspending purchases; this was one of the biggest de-grossing of hedge funds in history. [Chamath wrote a great Twitter thread about this](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354883147523997697), so amazing that I’ll just copy-paste his tweets rather than try to explain it better myself.

>*A children's book explanation of what's happening:*  
>  
>*1. If you are ""smart money"" you are allowed to take your $1 and leverage it up to $15+*  
>  
>*2. You can now buy $15 of stock AND if you promise to short companies, you can short $15 of stock as well*  
>  
>*3. In finance language, this means that you are $30 ""gross"" ($15 of longs + $15 of shorts) but $0 net (+$15 of longs -$15 of shorts). This makes everyone feel good because it feels like you are taking zero risk...but in reality, your $1 is exposed to $30 of risk.*  
>  
>*4. Now you go around and tell your friends about both your longs and your shorts and when you do it at a restaurant vs on Reddit, its called an ""ideas dinner"".*  
>  
>*5. You also publish your longs on a quarterly lag via an SEC rule.  You don't have to tell anyone about your shorts.*  
>  
>*6. Now the less cool people who weren't invited to the ideas dinners, start copying your longs based on your report.*  
>  
>*7. You realize that publicizing your shorts is also a good idea so instead of only selling stocks, you also BUY options (puts) which has to be reported.*

>  
>*11. So he grabs his chicken fingers and champagne and buys, starts a massive short squeeze. 12. Other's see what's happening and they jump in.*  
>  
>*13. Now a massive short squeeze starts.  You have to cover your shorts ASAP. But the banks also notice that you don't have enough credit to cover the $30 they lent you and ask for more collateral. You now also have to sell your long positions.*  
>  
>*14. What happens next is that a cascade of short covering and long selling starts driving some stocks to the moon and others way down.  Which stocks went up? Basically the ones that were the most heavily shorted by you and your buddies in the first place.*

[Hedge fund grossing \/ de-grossing](https://preview.redd.it/c5we1d7e0se61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a11131168d69e5f3aea93c8fd087a1478500ddc)

In other words, as stocks like GME go up, the highly-leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts. Most retail investors are limited to 2x leverage, but since hedge funds are “hedged” by taking short and long positions, they can be up to 30x levered since theoretically they would be shielded from external events that cause all stocks to go up or down in price (i.e. Beta neutral), so they’re “safer”. To get out of these short positions, they will need to massively unwind their long positions as well so they can still have a reasonable “Net Exposure”, triggering a sell-off in those stocks.

A very similar thing actually happened in March (with risk-parity) causing hedge funds to similarly massively de-gross, and literally everything from GLD to even AMZN’s stock price dropping as a result, even though theoretically COVID-19 would’ve been good for both from a fundamental basis, as we saw later on. It’s very likely that if Robinhood hadn’t stopped purchases of GME, many more hedge funds shorts would have had their shorts blow up and be forced to continue to de-gross causing a widespread stock market crash, potentially being the catalyst for finally popping the [decade-long liquidity (leverage)-fueled asset bubble we’ve been experiencing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) In fact, this could still happen since it doesn’t look like hedge funds have learned their lesson and **are still heavily short GME with Net Shares Shorts barely moving this week** [**according to S3 Partners**](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355225495835709441)**.** Furthermore, despite seeing the largest de-grossing of hedge funds since 2009, **gross exposure (aka leverage) of hedge funds still remains** [**close to record-high levels**](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-hedgefunds/goldman-sees-hedge-fund-exposures-close-to-records-ongoing-sell-off-risk-after-gamestop-swings-idUSL1N2K60GW).

**TLDR**

In case your attention span was too short to read everything above,

1. Robinhood is going to be doing everything they can to raise cash to resume GME purchases, when this happen GME 🚀🌝
2. Much of the stock market’s value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so **if GME (and other common shorts) 🚀🌝 the rest of the stock market might collapse around it (EDIT - as hedge funds re-consider their long / short strategy), triggering a financial crisis**

*Now, just to be clear, buying GME right now is joining a game of hot potato; the longer you hold the potato the more tendies you get to eat for dinner, but at some point this will all blow up and when it does someone will be the bagholder - and right now everyone is rooting for these bagholders to be the hedge funds that are short GME. That being said, with Short Interest barely moving this week, this day of reckoning doesn’t look like it’ll be coming in the next few days and for reasons mentioned above, it’s probably more likely for GME to reach $1K next week than the probability that it’ll fall below $100.*

Or in other words, [I like these stocks](https://www.highshortinterest.com/).

EDIT - Appearently S3 Partners just contradicted [their tweet on Friday](https://s3partners.com/Exclusive.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=announcement&utm_campaign=10ds) and now indicate that shares short of GME have dipped below 30M shares. Still highly shorted compared to most other stocks, fwiw.

EDIT2 - Getting alot of questions on how one short position in a small cap can do this, and my answer is that GME alone wouldn't cause a financial crisis, but rather what GME represents, which is disproving that hedge funds that a long / short strategy (i.e. taking out additional leverage to short similar companies they long) is unviable; The word from my hedge fund friends is that this type of thing would have been considered a six-sigma event, or one in a billion chance of happening; which is obviously no longer true. Hedge funds seeing Melvin go down will probably start re-consider their short books. This on mass will cause a mass short-covering and also sell-off of their longs.

I know this sub is getting absolutely bombarded with random hot takes and DD’s, but I’m hoping this might be an analogy that helps a lot of people understand GME and the squeeze that’s happening, and will be unique enough to stay. 


If you’re still struggling to understand the squeeze, shorting and the $GME trends, I’m here to help. Bear with me. (No, not that bear). 

This is gonna be really oversimplified, but be different than 🦍 and 🍌.

So, imagine a college star, up and coming high draft pick. Most sports are apt for this analogy, but NFL works best. 


This is a QB projected #1 pre-season. He’s legit. bona-fide, undeniable talent. Let’s call him Game Stop, (Stop, #69). 

He’s on a shit team and gets dealt a shit hand for 2020 (bad team + pandemic. Limits games played, falling off the radar). 

Now let’s a few things happen: 

1.) Someone makes a massive bet that Game Stop is washed, terrible and will never recover, but they have to borrow money to make that bet. They hate the player because they’re old and resentful and afraid of death, and they want to do everything they can to prevent this young player from succeeding. They want to force them to fail by making everyone else believe they will fail. 

2.) A new head coach gets hired, someone who is absolutely qualified and primed to bring out the absolute best in Game Stop, and revolutionize and evolve their game. 

3.) A random dude on the internet notices how high the bet is against the player, Game Stop. They think to themselves, “Hey, I’ve seen that dude play. His talent is undeniable, and he’s got the perfect new coach. There is no WAY he’s gonna be that bad”. 

4.) This dude let’s his buddies know about how high the bet against the player, Game Stop, is, and they agree. There is no WAY they’re that bad, especially with the new coach! There’s no way this bet can win, this is easy money!

5.) Word about the bet spreads like wildfire. Not only do more and more people do their research and watch game tape and realize how talented the player is, they realize how insane the bet against him is. 

Now, Game Stop (#69) starts to get back on track. They start playing games again and show their potential, their talent. They’re making a playoff run. Now they’re gaining more and more attention, and MORE people realize they’re gonna succeed. 

The original person who bet against the player, who was convinced they were washed, starts to panic. The person they borrowed the money from is starting to see what’s going on, and starts to ask for the money back. Every game that Game Stop plays, they prove themselves more and more, and the bet against them gets even more spicy. At this point, the bettor borrows even more money and DOUBLES DOWN, stubborn and convinced the player will fail and prove they were right. 

People aren’t having it. They’ve SEEN the games, they KNOW the talent, there is absolutely no way this player isn’t legit, no possible way for them to fail. They bet even more in support. They KNOW he’ll succeed, make the playoffs and win the championship and be the #1 pick. 

At this point, the person who bet against him is losing an insane amount of money. There is no way they can pay back the original bet. They’ll be absolutely ruined and embarrassed. Somehow, they have enough power to stop the player from playing games. They take the games off TV, they  delete the highlight videos, they go to the news screaming “This player is terrible. Trash, washed. Anyone who doesn’t believe that is delusional, wrong, and will lose a lot of money”. 
It doesn’t matter, everyone has already seen the games, the highlights, the talent, with their OWN EYES. It’s undeniable. The bet is terrible, and the new coach fits perfectly. 

Every single day the bettor doesn’t cut his losses, the person he borrowed from adds interest to the total they owe. They’re getting impatient and they see the writing on the wall. BUT, if they wanna continue, that’s fine, the bettor will just have to pay even more money at the end.


That’s where we’re at now. Exactly that. 

All it comes down to now, is all of us believing what we’ve already known, what we’ve already seen. They can take down the videos, they can blackout the media, they can keep them from even playing a game, but it’s too late. WE’VE SEEN IT. WE KNOW. WE KNOW THE TALENT, THE COACH, AND HOW BAD THE BET IS. 

All we have to do is believe in ourselves, and trust in the talent we’ve seen, and stick to our guns about how terrible the bet against the player was. Every moment that goes by, every game they play, the bet gets worse, and our position gets better. 

No matter what, the original better has to call it quits and take their losses, but they will do EVERYTHING they can to make us stumble, falter, fear. To make us doubt ourselves and what we’ve seen, what we know. They can’t. 


We watched this player in elementary school, in middle school, in high school, and college. They brought us countless moments of joy, and sometimes of sadness. We lost with them, but more importantly, we WON with them. How fucking DARE someone bet against them and their talent, and intentionally try to ruin their career, just out of spite, to make a profit. 

We know this player, we trust this player, we like this player, we believe in this player, and if we hold this player, by fucking God this player and everyone who believed in them, will win. We’ll succeed. 

And that son of a bitch who tried to ruin them? They lose everything.

Hello silver surfers, clang gang, and monkeys who enjoy shiny things

Thank you for helping [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the_real_dd_on_slv_the_worlds_biggest_short/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) go viral and make it on Zerohedge (dreams fulfilled).

Before I get GME hate mail, let me clarify I am still long GME and am looking for the moon in GME.  I also have a small long silver position.  Both positions are quite small as I am unfortunately not super well capitalized.  Many of the comments about buys on the previous post referenced order sizes I can only dream of at the moment, but I'm damn glad we have so much conviction behind this trade.

I created an official [Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/Thehappyhawaii1/status/1355663208774836228?s=20). Not sure if I’ll use it, but didn’t want anyone to impersonate me.

Clang gang acted so fast, that all the bullion dealers sold out over the weekend which is incredible, and overnight futures are spiking as we speak.  I continue to support the purchase of physical silver as a way to continue the short squeeze if you can find any of course.  The short squeeze thesis is built upon tying up as much of the physical silver into our diamond hands as possible.  With that said, I thought I would add some clarity to my position on the various options out there to play the silver squeeze.

**It is organized into 2 sections:**

**1. the futures market (for big players)**

**2. alternatives (for smaller players**)

&#x200B;

**1.**

**The futures market:** for the squeeze to really happen, we desperately need some of the bigger pocketed players who have access to the futures market to purchase silver contracts on the open market.  **If you can play in the futures market, it is imperative that you do so.**  I have been trying to find a retail broker who will allow customers to take physical delivery rather than force cash settlement but have had no luck so far.  If anyone knows of such a retail broker, please let me know so I can update the post with the info.  This is by far the most important piece of the short squeeze equation.

Let me explain:

When traders hold long futures contracts to expiration, they are making a statement that they want to take delivery.  Taking delivery does not mean the silver is transferred to your house, but rather it goes to the CME warehouse.  You can go pick it up from the warehouse or arrange transfer, or you can pay $8.50 a month per 1000 ounces to just store it at the warehouse (which is quite cheap at that scale).  The futures market allows players to use extreme amounts of margin and leverage, which is where the 'naked shorts' come from.  They are able to sell massive amounts of silver with very little collateral to back it up, and no actual silver on hand.  **This also explains why institutions such as citadel or others hold positions in the ETFs like SLV.** If you have more than 50,000 shares in SLV, you can request to have your share of the silver delivered to you.  They are hedging against their naked shorts in the futures market by trying to gain access to a source of silver should they need it.  The thing is, if the short squeeze occurs, even their holdings in SLV will not be enough to meet their obligations.

In order for the buyers to call their bluff they need to not use their margin power, as tempting as it may be to do so.  They need to only purchase as much silver in the futures market as they actually have money in their account to cover the final purchase (the price is locked in at the time of the futures contract purchase).  Then as expiration approaches, refuse to settle in cash, and pony up the money to actually buy the silver and have it delivered.  At that time the seller needs to find silver fast, and tries to purchase it from somewhere else to meet their contractual obligations.  The rush of all the naked shorts to try and find physical silver is what massively drives up the price and causes the short squeeze.

There may even be dips in the futures market if the buyers are planning to do the squeeze.  This is because they will not be using margin whiles the seller are.  The sellers may be able to push the price down temporarily, but when expiration comes they will find themselves in one hell of a bind when they find out all of the buyers actually have the cash in their accounts to take delivery and refuse to settle in cash.

As the supply of silver dries up and literally there is no way to fulfill the obligations of the long contract holders, the silver futures market will actually be effectively shut down.  The CME will force settle all remaining contracts for cash at the current market rate (which will have spiked dramatically).  This is the last thing the CME wants to do, and will only do it as a final last resort.  If this occurs we can declare victory at having exposed the silver futures market for the fraud that it is.  A futures market is built on the trust that the sellers can actually deliver the product they are selling, and if they can't then that trust is destroyed.  If you go long and they don't have the silver to give you, you will still be paid the money for that amount of silver at the going rate.

Following this collapse the futures market will relaunch at a 1-1 margin requirement.  This means that for every silver ounce sold, the seller will actually have to have the silver or at least the collateral to cover that exact amount of silver on the open market.  The futures market will have moved from 250-1 paper to physical, to 1-1.  The massive banks who were naked short will have lost tens or maybe even hundreds of billions of dollars collectively.  In my previous post I implied it was likely JP Morgan naked shorting.  They have a history of doing so and being fined for manipulation, but we don't actually know which big players are the current naked shorts and who might even be net long.

**2.**

**This is where the rest of us come in...** if you can't play the futures market, you can still purchase and tie up physical silver where the naked shorts can't access it.  Thus setting up the environment for the squeeze to occur.  Whether its WSB players or some other big fund who sees what is happening and does the futures part themselves, they will only be able to do so because of the smaller purchases of silver by millions of smaller players.

**Physical silver:** by purchasing physical silver you are taking silver off the market that the shorts will need when the squeeze occurs.  You aren't directly causing the short squeeze, you are helping to set up the environment for the squeeze to occur, and you will have the silver to sell after the squeeze happens.

**Silver ETFs (SLV, PSLV, SIVR):** this is the same concept as the physical silver.  By purchasing silver ETFs you are locking up physical into the ETF's vaults, which wont be able to be able to be purchased by the shorts in the futures market because they belong to the ETF shareholders.  There has been a ton of chatter about whether ETFs should be used at all, and of the ETFs which is the best or most reliable.  Frankly if you have doubts about the ETFs, just don't use them.  All of the physical silver is already sold out so this is the easiest way for most people to play at this point.  If you prefer physical but it’s sold out or selling for ridiculous premiums, just buy the ETFs until the premiums come down and then sell the ETF to purchase more physical. It is possible that at some point SLV (or other ETFs) will no longer create new shares as silver becomes impossible to find (thus they cant create a new share because they can't the silver to back it up).   At that point the ETFs will likely trade at a hefty premium to NAV and it may no longer make sense to purchase them.  But that hasn't occurred yet so I'd say it still certainly makes sense to buy these ETFs.  We have no proof that they are lying about their silver holdings, and if they disallow new share creation, I'd say that means they really aren't lying about their holdings, otherwise they would happily take as much investment as we would give them to collect management fees.

**Call options on Silver ETFs:** Calls will have a similar effect to purchasing the ETFs as the market maker will have to purchase the underlying ETF to be hedged.  It has a levered effect that can both hurt and help the squeeze depending on which direction the silver price is headed.

**Miners:** miners will benefit from the squeeze but buying them doesn't help the squeeze occur in any direct way.  People buying miners will benefit if we are successful, but the more capital that flows into them rather than the alternatives, it will lower the chances of the squeeze being successful in the first place.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

**if monke have lot of money, long futures with no margin and take delivery.**

**If monke not have lot of money, buy physical silver bullion and silver ETFs**

Hopefully this answered some of the questions that flooded my inbox from the previous post.  Good luck to all.  GME and SLV to moon.  Lets squeeze the naked shorts, expose the manipulation, and take our tendies from the hedge funds.

The TD ameritrade % held by institutions changed today...to 112.39%... which is an odd number because that would mean that there is 71-72 million share. However there are only 69.7M shares. Me being the autist I am, I checked for SEC filings which I couldn't find anything as of friday. Used a calculator (its that weird thing with number buttons) to count each institutions holdings and it checked out to the reported number. 

I'm not claiming that I'm smart, in fact I'm a dumbass who made most of his gains off of TLSA. However, and this is a big however, unless I am even dumber then I think I am, there can not be more than 100% of a companies shares. This means that EVEN THE INSTITUTIONS ARE HOLDING ARTIFICIAL SHARES. 

Again the if comes in, if I'm not a total dumbass, it means that just the institutions have the ability to diamond hand this bitch into infinity.  

So overall where does this leave the retards and autists and fomoers. Well, I don't fucking know. Some how this situation has to fix itself, if the government steps in we might get fucked. GME could step in and we get fucked. OR the free market resolves itself and we all go to uranus where there is a special tendie town built for gmetards.

We're in uncharted territory here and are witnessing a short squeeze which has never been seen before. We also don't have retrospect to show us what really happened as it all played out.

But we can look to the fabled Volkswagen short squeeze a while ago. I don't care about short interest or float or whatever: Volkswagen became the biggest company in the world at that time due to a short squeeze. If we consider market cap alone, how high can GME go?

Let's use 1 trillion as a nice round number. Sure there are companies with larger caps, but fuck I don't want to complicate things. GME (according to corrupt-as-fuck Robinhood) has a cap of 17 billion. Divide 1 trillion by this and we get the number 57. GME has to go up 57 times it's current price to be a trillion dollar company. 

330*57 is about $19,000 per share. If this squeeze played out like VW back in the day, we can look forward to at least this target. I could be wrong, I could be retarded, but this is what the math is pointing to if history somewhat repeats itself.

TL:DR: Buy and hold GameStop with 💎 ✋.

Anyway, here what I think these sneaky fuckers did:

Let’s say Melvbitch is short 100 shares. He needs to get 100 shares somehow to close this position to make it look like he got out of his short, but how does he get them? Calls. 

So, he buys a $0.5 1/29 call and exercises it (we will assume that SIG actually has the shares, so this doesn’t trigger a gamma squeeze). But, he needs money to buy and exercise this bad boy, and where does he get that? Calls again. 

So, he sells 4-5 (based on what I am seeing value wise) OTM calls to get this money. This maintains his short position whilst making it appear that he is no longer short SHARES. He can also spread to the news that he closed a short position. 

If these OTM calls that he sold them expire OTM, he wins and gets out of the short basically. 

But no, thanks to the norse legend himself and all of you diamond handed autists, those bad boys expired ITM on Friday. Did Melvbitch have the shares for when these options got exercised, no. Did he get assigned them and is therefore still short despite making it appear that he is out? Yes. Now this fucker has to buy even more shares than he originally owed. 

Tldr: if I am correct, the S3 data is missing the options fuckery that they performed last week and they still have to buy hella shares. 

GME 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💎🙌

**Thesis:**  
With the advent of online gaming and e-sport, Gamestop is prime to make a turnaround and grow again assuming it will change direction and adapt post Covid. The support of Ryan Cohen, a e-commerce marketing guru, has brought hope to a once-beloved brand and ignited the flame of this reality.  The stock is also enticing because of its 138% short interest which is the highest percentage in the market. Thus, a remote chance of a short squeeze could occur. *Majority of investors do actually believe in the company and is not in it for  just the short squeeze opportunity. *    
&nbsp;

--  
**Background:**  
Gamestop was once the most prolific gaming retailer in the brick and mortar time period. They made their profits by rebuying used games/gaming paraphernalia at low prices and marking them up greatly. They relied mainly on foot traffic due to a subpar online presence and they were slow to change. The low price and convenience of online shopping had won over shoppers causing the demise of brick and mortar. Large brands started disappearing left and right and now it was Gamestop's turn with a boost from Covid. Investors wrote GameStop off as a dinosaur company with its shares eventually dropping to $2.5 dollar.

--  
**Results:**   
Hedge funds saw this and decided to go short on them, betting on their demise like all the others. The funds abused the mechanism of the market to cause a large selling pressure onto the stock, forcing the stock price down and accelerating the demise. Could this be manipulation? If a hedge fund were to short a company out of spite, they could very possibly bankrupt a company.  

--  
**How did Gamestop survive for so long?**  
Even though they weren't raking in e-commerce profit, they were still profitable. It was just that that profit stream was shrinking. The profits were also concentrated at a fraction of their stores. As they closed unprofitable stores, they were able to offset cost slightly. Investors were also holding on to the imminent release of the new console super cycle. Investors noted that the golden days were right after the new consoles were released and Dec 2020 couldn't come quicker. Gamestop was patience and managed their financials well with a strong balance sheet. Investors had underpriced the real estate of theirs. They were not valued for growth anymore so they weren't in a situation to raise capital risk free. They have several billions in short-term and long-term debt but  they had 600 million cash in hand to cushion with. Lastly, the Nintendo switch had just came out and was the best selling gaming console ever. Gamestop rode the tailend of Nintendo success all through 2020 with Switch sales offsetting losses in the other gaming segments.

--  
**The turnaround:**  
A new management team had join in August 2019 that set to slim down the company. They were much more aggressive and sought to aggressively close stores. A comprehensive turnaround plan called GameStop ReBoot  was announced with 4 elements:   
  
1. Optimized the Core Business  
	Reducing unprofitable stores and focusing on what works  
2. Become the Social / Cultural Hub for Gaming  
	Turning Gamestop into a experience center and not just a store  
3. Build a Frictionless Digital Ecosystem  
	Revamp the supply chain to be e-commerce focused  
4. Transform Vendor Partnership  
	Rekindle and make new partnerships   
  
Like all new managements, this one needed time but unfortunately Covid complicated the plans. Investors became increasingly doubtful and even bearish. However, they had underestimated the future of gaming. 

--  
The first significant move was bringing Reginald Fils-Aimé onto the board of directors. Reginald was known for his market prowess bring Nintendo to what it is today. Investors loved that. 

--  
As Covid happened, working from home and home entertainment exploded. Logitech, Corsair, Bestbuy exploded. Online gaming was projected to be very ludicrous in the next decade and Covid had shorten this timeline. Online gaming took off. Activision, Electronic Arts, Zynga, Tencent all exploded. Apple app revenue from their gaming segment exploded. Investors had repriced these stocks higher taking advantage of the first player advantage. One notable company that changed in valuation was Logitech, they were a value company but relabeled to growth. What was missing from this list was Gamestop. The bullishness in gaming was there and everyone else profited. If there was hope of a GME turnaround, their valuation model would certainly flip to a growth model at higher PE multiples. It was only fair.    

--  
The next big event that occurred  was in October 2020. Gamestop announced a partnership with Microsoft which was the first real tangible milestone on the turnaround plan. Investors started to give the company a second look.  Microsoft Partnership caused shares to rally 30% in a day. A bullish sign that the big players haven't given up. However this was short lived as shorts continue to drive the price down as there was no concrete details on the revenue sharing partnership, only that ""for every Microsoft Xbox console that GameStop sells going forward, GameStop will get some percentage of the revenue from every digital full game download, DLC, microtransaction, and any subscriptions as well."" To me this sounds very bullish that Microsoft still believes in Gamestop.  
 
--  
Next came news that the well-respected businessmen Ryan Cohen released that he had bought up 13% of Gamestop shares, becoming a minority owner. Ryan Cohen was the founder of Chewy, a Petsmart online branch that outcompeted Amazon. Investors labeled him an e-commerce guru/genius. He had bought shares at $4.81 and slowly gobbled up more as the price increased. Rumors started speculating that Cohen would takeover and transform Gamestop and it was materialized when Cohen sent the management a very aggressive letter.  

--  
""GameStop’s leadership should immediately conduct a strategic review of the business and share a credible plan for seizing the tremendous opportunities in the rapidly-growing gaming sector. GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences – not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem.""  

--  
It was a do this or else there will be a hostile takeover. The letter was sent three weeks before Q3 Earnings and investors were now watching intensively for details of a roadmap or of a Cohen reference during the earning call. ER came around and management was mute beside the announcement of a shelf offering of 100mil. Company performance wise, they were negative on profit but had still beaten expectations. The expedited closure of unprofitable of the stores helped. The stock would have soared had not an offering been announce (offering dilutes shares) so instead GME dropped 17%. From the conference calls, many bull investors felt reluctantly weary of this turnaround while some even dismissed management consideration of Ryan and piled on to the shorts. A week later, a filing by Ryan Cohen showed that he had continued to believe that the stock was undervalued and bought even at $14.83. This news rekindled the speculation that Ryan Cohen was going to do a takeover. Stock bounced and soared to $22.35 dollars for the next few weeks before dropping to $17.35.    

--  
**Jan 2021 - The first squeeze:**  
Shorts were still convinced that Gamestop would not be turn around and so they held steady with a short interest above 130%. Some short sellers had left while new ones piled on.    

--  
Monday, Jan 11th, Gamestop decided to drop bombs to the short:  
- First with an announcement that there was 309% increase in e-commerce sales from 2019 holiday season, 4.8% increase in comparable store sales, 3.1% decrease in total sales.  
	- The biggest takeaway was that their new e-commerce strategy was working. 309% increase is massive. Also this followed their original plan to concentrate on their core. Rise in sales of profitable store was also shown. The closure unprofitable stores hit their total sales but it was not much and implied that these stores were dead weight. They slimmed their bleeding cost segment and increased their profit. This was super bullish.  
- Secondly, a board of advisor switch up was announced. Ryan Cohen and two main Chewy guys were hopping on, replacing 3 other people. 
	- Ryan essentially brought Chewy Management to Gamestop. They know have 1/3 of the company's vote.  
	- GME Management knew that a takeover was happening, hostile or not and so they opened the doors. They also expanded Ryan Cohen's ability to buy up to 20% of the total shares  
	- Permit And Hestia Capital also align more with his vision so that would put them at a 5/9 majority  
Result: Even with the news, the stock price stayed range bound at 20.5 and volume was extremely low for that Monday and Tuesday.  Shorts were once again depressing the price. However, Wednesday came and the first of the shorts closed their position while bulls bought calls. The stock soared. This catalyzed into a gamma squeeze to kick off the huge rally.  

--  
The analysis stopped dead of the gamma squeeze as these recent events have been a gray area of interpretation. Enjoy.

dick-eating bear thesis that the SQUEEZE has in fact, been ALREADY SQUOZE.**

_Let me preface that for all the 5M newbies to this sub, I
am saddened that my favorite sub since 2017 has been invaded by normies. But at
the same time, I am excited for all the new amount of fodder (yeah, you) for
memes. So WELCOME TO THE GANG, GANG &lt;3_

**

THESIS: The big short squeeze has already happened.**

**

When?**

Approximately from the when our lord and savior Burry probably cashed out
(sometime before his settlement date for 13-F filing coming out in 2 weeks
time) to when the news broke and Cramer shat his pants on CNBC last Monday.

**

Why do you think this?**

First, MELVIN was NOT the ONLY ones SHORT, they were just
the slowest ones to cover (and hence probably will continue to be the poster-child for
bukkake gang-rape by millennials and zoomers with stimmy checks).

Second, GME literally went from $5 per share to $37 per
share by January 15, 2021, the settlement date for the latest short float
update (I’ll come back to your fucking daily updates from S3 Partners and Ortex
later on, and why I don’t trust them).

To put it into perspective for these unscrupulous, criminal,
BIG money positions on the short-side that have been here a LOOOONG time,
that’s already a 750% loss.

If someone had put in **JUST** $1M in August 2020 (by the
way, the short float % was around 99% at this time, so I KNOW more got in short
after this) hoping for a Gamestop bankruptcy, by Jan 15, 2021 these fuckers
would have lost $8M in total (initiating position would have been about 200K
shares short, by the time it gets to 1/15/2021, $37 x 200K shares =  $7.4M.

So, by wagering $1M on the short side, you now have to buy
back and return your shares. You now have a $6.4M loss.

**WELL THAT FUCKING SUCKS? Right? Well then what does a 400-IQ,
uncircumcized-dick hedgie with a wedgie want to do about this situation? They
GOTTA make that loss back SOMEWAY SOMEHOW.**

You could suck trucker dick or deal drugs, but these
white-collar yuppies have enough power to NOT have to stoop down to that level.

**

Here is how they CAN, and probably ARE, doing it right
now:**

Melvin wasn’t the only short position. Just the most
retarded one that didn’t cover in time, so they had to go through a whole
fucking liquidity crisis, class action lawsuit, and dick-eating meme-fest while
literally asking for sugar-daddy money. What about the less retarded short
positions? Well, they probably have some losses too, because I mean, they did
get squeezed in the earlier portion of the play, but now they have sights on
something else.

**First, your hedgies (excluding Melvin & Citron)
continue to push the narrative: “Throw Melvin & Citron to the masses and
keep the retail investors coming in with their diamond hands and high school
diplomas.”**

Second, **hedgies go LONG on GME shares now**. WTF HOW?
Well remember that for short positions, there are LENDERS of these shares.
These lenders would happily let go of their positions at the “top” of a
squeeze. (It’s ez fucking profit, and they want none of this mess).

Third, you now have a long position with underlying shares.
What’s the best play here? You fucking write call options because the vol
premiums are literally mooning at the moment. And I’ve been on WSB long enough
to know that WSB’s risk management is literally just selling one-paired organ
to afford the option premium on FDs.

Lastly, you push the narrative of a “GAMMA SQUEEZE” which is
JUST a little bit too hard for your average joe from Mississippi to understand
with his Algebra 2 from high school – Essentially telling him, “HEY THERES
STILL MORE TO SQUEEEEEZE.”

 

**

REAL Gs MOVE IN SILENCE:**

Look at the volumes, the float rotation in the past week for
GME is already enough to have fucked virgins 20 times and sacrificed them to
capitalist gods. 

Which means for hedgies with wedgies, it’s no longer a
tail-risk, blind-side event, it’s time to REAP the souls of every stimmy check
fool, by “MaRkET MAkInG”.

If I am that Hedgie, I write call options, while maintaining
a façade that I will “rationally” hedge those positions by buying more of the
underlying shares. FUN FACT: I already have them.

You stimmy check tards will keep buying into GME, because
you heard about it in the news over the weekend and want to get in on this
action to “STICK IT TO THE MAN” because 2020 has been an absolute suicidal
descent into madness because of COVID. You will probably go on for a couple
more days this upcoming week, now that liquidity restrictions are slowly being
lifted on trading platforms.

SO, while you fools supply buying volume, all I have to do
is collect my premiums on option sales, while slowly unwinding my underlying
share positions, and thereby also managing risk of option assignment since I’ll
sell shares into every spike and swerve the price away from the strike price of
YOUR options.

And I’ll also have an expectation as to where GME could
potentially rise to. You just look at the WSB subscriber count, multiply that
by the avg retail trader account liquidity.

You guys will think you have stuck it to the man, but the
man is sticking your wife ALREADY, ever since the moment you got angry and
emotional about an opportunity to unleash your pent up hatred towards the Wall
Street system. All I am saying is, for every tard like Melvin, there’s 20 other
hedgies out there to fuck you up without you even realizing it. After all it’s
done, they’ll even make you feel bad, saying you were “Greedy” and “Reckless”,
further perpetuating emotional volatility in markets that they will keep
profiting off of.

So while the retail GME HODLER thinks there’s still enough
gold raining from the top of midtown Manhattan, all they’re getting is piss and
pre-cum.

 

**

APPENDIX – Ortex & S3 Partners**

If you got all the way through until now, I apologize for my
lack of presentation in this thesis, it’s literally 3AM in the East Coast US
because I’m up for 4AM pre-market (don’t fucking judge me, I’m a retard too).

So I’ll explain that point from WAY up there about short
interest estimates.

I don’t give a flying fuck what Ortex and S3 Partners says.
I do NOT believe that short float is STILL above %100 after the official data
came out on 1/27 with a lag of two fucking weeks from its settlement date on
1/15. The stock price moved so egregiously that every autist in Manhattan would
have literally gone bankrupt if they’re still short, NOT just Melvin.

See, here’s the thing. If the system is ALREADY built with
this **two weeks lag** on short data for individual stocks, what fucking
data analytics company in their right mind would NOT try to take advantage of
this time & information arbitrage? The system is FUCKED, but it gets
perpetuated because the ones perpetuating this have the MOST to gain.

Ortex and S3 Partners is purely a marketing ploy, they
hopped on this gravy train to get your subcriptions and some more clicky-clicks
on their website traffic so they can use those metrics to raise some more funds
later on.

And even if they believed in your cause, no smart data
analytics firm would willingly give up that information arbitrage to the
public, if they want to ever think about doing business with ANY hedge-fund in
town.

Therefore, I am sticking to my autistic thought that the
system is stacked (which most of you agree) against us. BUT, I urge you to be a
little bit more careful, because short float data can be misleading at best and
a total fraudulent bull-trap at worst. 

Again, If you are new here, welcome to the gang. This sub
will always be about losing money and becoming best friends with your wife’s
boyfriend. But over time, it will be about the friends and knowledge you gained
along the way.

Inspired by his analysis, I wanted to investigate the SEC's publicly available Failed to Deliver data and see how it compared to other companies over time.

I wrote some code to process the the raw SEC data and normalize the shares that failed to deliver by the total number of outstanding shares of the company. This gives us a view that where each company's FTD shares are expressed as a percentage of the outstanding, so we can fairly compare companies to one another.

(Before you ask, yes I account for fluctuating values of outstanding shares.)

I went back to the beginning of 2019, looking at a few of the recent meme stocks with short squeezes as well as the top 10 (by weight) in the S&P 500 as well as GE (as an example of a stock with very low short interest). Here's what I found.

[This is not normal.](https://preview.redd.it/9us7kdme1ue61.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddf843285adac642c3d15360c71e14ed04566a38)

Shares can fail to deliver for many reasons, but when large numbers of shares fail to deliver a likely explanation is naked short selling. For a thorough explanation of this, see [this article](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html).

Back in early 2019, both GME and AMC look like the others. All had sub-1% of their outstanding shares end up as FTD. But starting in mid 2019, both GME and AMC experienced three waves of progressively larger naked short selling attacks. This is known as [scaling in](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scale-in.asp).

I wanted to see if I could find corroborating evidence of news and price data which aligned in time with these waves of naked shorting. What I found were two stories, both similar, explaining how GME and AMC got to where they are today.

# GameStop

The first wave (small bet) of naked shorts occurred in June and July of 2019. GME reported Q1 '19 earnings on June 4th after hours, with a [bleak future outlook](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/06/05/gamestop-stock-plunges-nearly-percent-gamers-brace-new-era-consoles/). Overall sales was down $1.5B, net income plunged by 78%. This story is what formed the core of the bear thesis. The stock dropped 36% on the news.

[GME Q1 '19 Earnings. Oof.](https://preview.redd.it/vbrosels1ue61.png?width=2804&format=png&auto=webp&s=b04f103567aa52b8af929191f14fbae86a41f0e4)

But things changed when Q2 '19 earnings came around. Yes, sales were down again and the numbers didn't look good, but the company announced it was going to [reboot with a major strategic update](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/09/10/1913815/0/en/GameStop-Reports-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-2019-Results.html). They were going to make their retail stores more efficient by closing some locations, focus on becoming a social hub for gaming, and build a digital platform around the relaunched GameStop website.

Investors liked the news and the stock tries to move upwards, but is repeatedly beaten down. This lines up with the second wave of naked shorting. The original short sellers couldn't let the price float up, so they resorted to more than doubling down on their original naked short bet to keep the stock trending downward.

[Naked Shorts double down, gotta drive it to zero faster than they can rebuild!](https://preview.redd.it/p6x5x8zw1ue61.png?width=2772&format=png&auto=webp&s=382b78b87a737dc480f85bccea573096ca681706)

Finally COVID hits the US in March and April. Lockdowns happen and it becomes clear that nobody is going to malls anytime soon. This is where the third and final massive wave of naked short selling happens, attempting to push GME into bankruptcy. Remember, that's always the goal with naked short selling. If the company goes bankrupt, especially with a convenient parallel story (""It was a failing company anyway and COVID was the nail in the coffin!""), then nobody bothers to look into how many counterfeit shares might be floating around out there. They aren't worth anything, so who cares!

At its peak, **over 20% of the company's entire outstanding shares were failing to deliver every month**. This is confirmed by a tweet from Michael Burry (since deleted, he scrubs his tweets) that says when he tried to recall his lent-out shares, it took his broker **many weeks** to locate them. Remember, companies normally have well below 1% of their outstanding shares fail to deliver every month.

# AMC Entertainment

To understand how we got here with AMC, you need to look back further, to 2017. AMC has been struggling to be profitable for a while. They had a history of posting very small net profits along with many net losses. Their cash on hand was hovering around $300M and their corporate borrowing had been going up.

[Trying to hard to not lose money.](https://preview.redd.it/g7zugy792ue61.png?width=1876&format=png&auto=webp&s=f580cf12bad13197ed1426466d8b183a4191933e)

[Surely borrowing will make this problem go away!](https://preview.redd.it/jtgjqlu92ue61.png?width=1876&format=png&auto=webp&s=93a8ac04fd426390354024ce016a2a08df36c79f)

What coincided with the first small naked short bet on AMC in June/July of 2019? Their cash on hand just dipped below $200M (from being stable around $300m). The last time that happened, AMC more than doubled its corporate loans. The short hedge funds smelled blood in the water.

The second bet, where the naked shorts doubled down occurred in November of 2019. What happened then? AMC Q3 earnings, which showed that cash on hand had dropped to a precipitous $100M. Bankruptcy was in sight for the hedge funds...

And then COVID hit. Their massive third wave bet was similar to GameStop, though slightly more delayed. Why? May 2020 was the peak of naked short selling, around the time when some businesses were able to reopen with restrictions, but it was clear that **movie theaters**, among a few other things, would be staying closed until the pandemic was completely over.

Also like GameStop, at its peak **over 20% of the company's outstanding shares were failing to deliver**. This is not normal.

# Conclusion

I think the evidence shows there is a strong reason to believe that one or more hedge funds, probably in collusion with broker dealers or the DTCC, have been deliberately naked short selling both GME and AMC since mid-2019. They made small bets to start with in the first wave, doubled down a few months later, but stupidly went all-in for the kill when COVID hit the US. It presented a unique scapegoat that nobody would question for pushing a failing mall retailer and a dwindling movie chain out of business.

Where does this leave us? I don't know. Unless this results in some kind of economic crisis (and I'm beginning to think it will), I don't see anything getting seriously investigated or changing. This is the same crap that happened with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008, but nobody was went to jail for it. Of course they were going to keep doing it.

**This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and paste.**

Positions: 100 GME @ $36, 500 AMC @ $2.75 (but I wrote $3 calls before it mooned... GUH)

After what happened with gamestop, I'm convinced that this shit really might work out. On the other hand there are a lot of people thinking that this is just something to draw attention away from GME and withdraw fund from the stock. Let me assure you this is not my attention. And if you're all about GME I suggest reading here because it's a waste of time.

I personally think that slv really might be the next big thing that could work out. Therefore I'd suggest to not go against the idea generally. Keep your hands at gamestop as long as you want, but once work is done, get together into this next big thing.

\*\*Here's what happens or might happen:\*\*About the theory of the silversqueeze. Can't really be compared to the GME squeeze as it is not about squeezing out hedgefunds shortsellers in particular. The idea is that the silver price is priced way too low for the amount of silver that physically exists. The silvermarket volume on paper (exchanges/Futures..) is 250 times bigger than the supply of physical silver (just read this and didn't do my own DD if numbers are correct). The Idea is that a physical shortage will be caused and this would really let slv skyrocket with all that derivatives that are not backed. Now imagine some 7 million apes and the following retail investors that come after suddenly plunger the physical silver market...

Example: Let's assume there is a shortage and Person A wants physical delivery of the future he bought. Person B as the seller needs to deliver 5000 ounces of silver. If supply is short, the person buys another future from Person C in order to be able to deliver the slv needed. You understand the reaction this causes.

Also the silver market is said to be manipulated and kept low for a long time. I have no opinion on this.

\*\*What happened on the weekend?\*\*Silver already surged 20% since friday morning which was most likely a result of the news of ""Wallstreetbets taking over silver"" and ""Shortage in silver supply"".example: [https://twitter.com/bitpanda/status/1356023060814585859](https://twitter.com/bitpanda/status/1356023060814585859)Also I noticed several locals stores and online stores being sold out completely on silver and it looks like this is not only regarding a few small dealers.[https://www.theepochtimes.com/reddit-forum-sparks-physical-silver-shortage-on-major-dealers-websites\_3679079.html](https://www.theepochtimes.com/reddit-forum-sparks-physical-silver-shortage-on-major-dealers-websites_3679079.html)Also social media generates a lot of heat.

So it look's like it's happening - if we're heading to a global shortage, prices could absolutely go to the moon and this is a big time chance to be with it at the beginning right now. Additionally there is a good chance that shortsellers have learnt from what was happening with GME and they might get out of their short positions earlier which will generate further momentum.

**What you can do** in order to participate and make this work:It does not help the cause if you buy mining companys (even though it might generate good income). But still, in order moon the prices, you'll need to invest physically. The options are:\* Buying silver futures and let it physically deliver. Only possible if you can easily invest some 150k.\* Buying slv or pslv if you live at the hamburgers, and for instance ""Xtrackers physical silber"" if you're from Europe. It's really important that you check if the fund needs to fully physically cover it's assets (=buy silver). Because not all do so.\* The next option is to physically buy silver at your local store or webshop.\* At last, you can buy options. Your counterpart might want to hedge the positions and therefore will potentially be covered. This is also obviously the part where you can win big time (or lose everything). My weapon of choice is:  34.00C expiring in April

I prefer a mix of above.

But as we all know, I'm just another ape sharing brainfarts, hence I'm definitely not in the position to give financial advice. Also I'm long on slv, silver options and bought the silver of some local shops.

TL;DR:This post is **NOT about GME**. No selly selly - I get the hype! But silver might be one of the best chances for the upcoming weeks I believe. And today it's still a chance to get in early at low prices.

e/okay, guess we have to wait until GME is through. Looks like most in here aren't open for a new relationsship. Anything that's not GME/AMC gets downvoted to hell. ITT: People with weak hands scared of any funds going from gme to slv - this is ridiculous.

I spent the weekend looking for good opportunities to flip wall street. I set out looking for stocks that have good technicals to pull off a GME style short squeeze. I think DMC Global Inc, trading as BOOM (yep, that really is the ticker), is our best play. Here is why.

To find a play, I am looking for companies that are way over shorted, that aren’t too big and that could be squeezed by a WSB onslaught. I looked for these things:

1. Stock where there is **more than 100% institutional hold**, which indicates naked short selling
2. Stock where there is **more than 15% of float that is openly shorted**, these are shares that have been borrowed and shorted.
3. Stock with a **reasonable market cap** so we can move it, smaller is better here.
4. Any other factors revealed by a review of the company.

I am not an investment advisor and I am not giving any investment advice. #DYOR I have an MBA and know how markets work. I’m a geek who got into coding and finance in high school and working and investing for more than 20 years. I bought my first Jag with investment gains and people asked if I was old enough to drive it! I also got screwed over multiple times by banks and institutional investors. In 2008, I lost 3 years of my hard work investing when a broker closed out some of my positions at the worst possible crashing moment (to protect me!) and left me holding a bag of shit. I watched my broker front run my trades. When started with OTC, I saw them settle their prop desk’s least favorable trades of the day to me. Robinhood didn’t invent this stuff. If you’re in this to change Wall Street, let’s break their trades and take back the markets.

First, I think targeting companies like Nokia is a bad idea. **NOK has a market cap of 25.6 billion and not enough shorts on it. It will be very hard to move such a monster. BB is another case with few shorts and almost 9bil mkt cap.** AMC with a cap of 4.5 billion is already a challenge. GME was around 2 billion when we started this and it’s 22 billion now - very hard to hold at this level. We have to ask: **“How big is this challenge - a mountain or a boulder?” and “Who’s on the other side of  the trade and how deep?”** Keep these questions in mind before we move.

Secondly, **this is not long term investing** \- we are playing a hard game vs. wall street. It’s about momentum and trade positions. Company data doesn’t matter: EPS, EBITDA, cash flow - it doesn’t matter for a short squeeze trade. With GME, we have given the company a great opportunity to raise funds and pivot, but its future depends on management. We bankrupted Melvin. That is our achievement. Our goal is hitting the crooks on the other side of these trades: Citadel, SAC, Robinhood, etc. The company is just the football in this game.

Two interesting companies are Teradata Corp and Allogene Therapeutics Inc. These are short squeeze opportunities as well. TDC, has a 105.98% institutional and a 19.46% short interest with a cap of 2.9billion. TDC is almost 4x bigger than BOOM, so it will be harder to move with lower beta and a lower institutional so moves will have less impact. ALLO, has a 61.46% institutional and a 19.52% short interest with a cap of 4.9billion. Price action is not aggressive either but Allogen 8x bigger than BOOM and could be much harder to move.

After looking at these and several other candidates, I found the best option, one that I believe could be successful in less than 3 days. It is DMC Global Inc. (NASDAQ:BOOM)

1. **DMC has 114.49% institutional hold** \- this means that there are hedge funds that have big short positions on this stock, many of which are naked. Naked shorts create the phantom shares representing 15% more than the float. Naked short is when you short the stock and the lender who let you short sell the stock actually didn’t deliver the stock to you. This creates phantom shares. *Let me say that again:* there are 115% of the issued shares in play, that extra 15% in play *does not exist, but is owed*. These shares have been short sold without actually having shares to sell.
2. **DMC has 17.46% Short Interest**, so pretty heavily shorted. This means that pushing the stock up will squeeze that like a big zit on a small face.  This is way bigger % than NOK and BB who have a little zit on a big face.
3. **The market cap is just around 1 billion**. It won’t take huge volume to squeeze this one.
4. Other interesting features are a) **beta of 1.3**. The stock historically moves more than the market and b) recent price moves are up, but the **stock hasn’t had any crazy big run**, so there is a lot of room to push this up really fast. c) fyi: DMC has a real business manufacturing metal parts and accessories using explosives for the energy industry,
5. **It trades under ticker BOOM. This is a poetic bonus for this story.**

After looking at these and lots of others. I concluded that the best play is BOOM, it’s just like a ripe cherry waiting to be picked. I can find no better chance of success than this: a perfectly sized company that is as leveraged and as owned by hedgies as this. **I put this out for everyone and let the WSB mods decide.** The situation won’t stay like this for long in these volatile markets, so if we decide to act, it must be now. Let’s make this week another one for the history books. This is our moment. Let’s change the world, one BOOM at a time!

It is a revolution! It is regular people against the establishment. It's the unemployed bankrupting hedgefunds. Throw away your old valuations and look at this new. This is a movement....and there's fucking value in that!

How high can this go? This is where Ryan Cohen shines. We never know how far he will take this, but I know the dude is fucking brilliant. So fucking brilliant that I'm willing to give him my entire 401k to make this happen.

GameStop is no longer a retailer, it is a viral company. We need to value it like a viral company. Look at Dollar Shave Club. (Almost) everyone buys razors and doesn't give a shit where they come from. But DSC changed everything. People WANTED to buy razors from DSC. I believe we will WANT to buy from GameStop. Fuck, I love this company (and stock) so much, if GameStop starts selling razors, I will buy them.

Dollar Shave Club was sold to Unilever for $1billion when sales were around $100million ($200million projected). I believe GameStop has more value. They are going to increase sales 3x or 4x. They will increase their online presence and start selling more products. This is going to be huge. My valuation of GameStop is 15x current sales, or $1,398.85 per share and my target price is $2,797.70 within 2 years. 

The short squeeze will push this stock even higher, but for the long term the current price is a bargain.

I'M HOLDING THIS STOCK!

I know GameStop is a good retail company and I'm confident they will grow after this, but it is also personal. The criminals who paused my trades need to go to jail. When they get out, I want them to see a fucking GameStop store everywhere they go. Every shopping center, every mall, fucking everywhere! I want Gamestop to be bigger than Walmart. To do my part, I will buy everything from Gamestop. If they sell toiletpaper, I'll fucking buy.

$300/share is a bargain.
Buy GME and hold

Also in light of the diversion and fake news tactics we can now observe, e. g. concerning silver, all data has to be regarded with caution.

Short positions have to be filed officially but with some delay. The last official update is from January 15th, 2021 and showed around 123% of GME float shorted. In the meantime, market intelligence firms provide reports about estimated short interest, which they sell as a product along with news and analytics services. Among these firms are IHS Markit Ltd. and S3 Partners.

According to Markit, short interest is now about 39%, S3 Partners states around 50%. Both values would be well elevated compared to the rest of the market. We also don't know to what extent these alleged numbers include new short positions at higher prices.

However, since the enormous short percentage of GME and the extreme increase in price, it can be argued that the short squeeze is not over and will continue, if the stock price stays elevated.

The short squeeze will only be over, if the shortsellers have abandoned old positions and are comfortable in new positions, if the intend to open them.

GME's stock price over time is one of the deciding factors here. If the price moves in favour of shorts still holding their positions, the may decide not to close them. If price stays elevated, additional shortsellers may need to close their positions, sending the price up.

\#Edit 1: For anybody criticizing this post: the percentages are, regardless if the allegedly came down, extreme numbers. It is logical that the massive increase in share price came due to some positions being closed and therefore Hedge Funds suffering. But the shorts are still in and that is why they use all their foul play. Someone on here recently deducted how high the percentage of retail holders could be. It was estimated 10 shares per user. The float is only 50m. The big squeeze is not off the table. Don't jump to conclusions because my post doesn't contain rockets and so forth.

BUY THE FUCKING DIP. THEY'RE PUNISHING THE RETARDS THAT HELD CALLS TO EXPIRY WITHOUT ALSO HOLDING ENOUGH MONEY FOR THE SHARES.




**TL;DR**
>Not investment advice. Market goes up and down, I think GME will go up. But this is to protect the true retards that held FDs through to expiry on a low budget account.

>They could potentially do a short attack to lower the prices enough that brokers margin call the owners of ITM calls on Monday. You can short the float for 100 shares, essentially making yourself delta neutral to protect yourself, then you get rid of them both on open with full gains.

Price is down $20 AH so be prepared for the morning dip. More scare tactics.

So, if institutional investors want to punish the retail investors they need to do it in a way that the retail investors have trouble countering.

In most cases, they would try to get the strike to where a majority of the open options positions would expire just under the strike with the most interest to keep people from having them executed and making money (in this case, the target would be <$320)

But my theory is, since there is a huge short interest, it's better for the big players to let GME finish above 320 which causes the largest open interest (300, 320) to all get auto-exercised.

Most retail traders don't know how to prevent the auto-exercise, so this causes a bunch of people to buy the stock at 300 and 320 (and various other strikes, under the 325 closing price)

Then they short the price down hard and buy to cover at the lower price in after-hours market, which has much less exposure to the retail investors. Right now the price is down to ~300.

This allows them to gain a profit of ~$20 right now on the execution of those 320s and potentially more, if the price continues to drop.

If the price actually tanks well below 300, this will additionally trigger margin calls Monday morning on the people assigned the shares at 320 and generate maximum profit for the short sellers.

It's too early to determine if this will happen since it would require a hell of a sell-off, but there is clearly an absolute ton of pressure to lower the price after hours to punish those who were holding 300 and 320 calls.

To give a more concrete example of how to manipulate the price:

HF buys GME when it dipped under $150.

HF sells GME 320 calls after it goes back up, for $$$$

Market pins GME at 325 at expiry, forcing auto assignment of 320s

Instead of allowing the cheap GME to be called away, they force the price down after hours.

They buy shares to cover their short calls at a discount, since they will get $320 for them.

Price was bouncing pretty hard between 300-320, but creeping back over 320 now. Should be quite interesting to see if it holds.

Ford is also making the electric Mustang SUV and I know a lot of people are pissed about the use of the Mustang name but in all honesty that car looks bad ass.

I like this options play because the spread for options dated two years out is really tight. I understand this is because the volatility is low and the chances of Ford hitting that price are remote but I'd gander that's in the absence of new information about an all electric lineup.

There is a VERY real situation on the available PHYSICAL silver you can buy. The stock SLV is so trash, it doesn't even keep up with Physical silvers price.

TD Precious Metals has been down for 2 days. Online stores are VERY low on stock.

>In response to the rapidly-evolving COVID-19 situation, the TD Precious Metals digital store is currently unavailable, but please check back later. Thank you for your patience

Locally you could call up your silver dealers and a lot of them are simply NOT SELLING! It's WILD. Just think, about this idea. let it ponder. Back in the day, 1 oz of silver = 1 dollar. If 1 OZ of silver was worth even 1% of our monetary system it would equal 2 MILLION DOLLARS an OUNCE!

Buying silver right now is insurance you have for THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. You really can't go wrong.

If even 6M people (IN THE WHOLE WORLD) bought 1500 worth of physical silver, the shortage would be SO GREAT, the price would increase over 1,000 / oz.

>**Constraints in Supply**Why can’t we just mine more silver? The reason we cannot “fix” the problem by mining more silver is the cost. Today for example, to mine gold, it takes $350 \[to $450\] to mine, refine, and bring to market one ounce of the yellow metal. With gold trading around \[$1200\] an ounce, that is a profitable endeavor. Silver however, is mined \[primarily\] as a by-product. In order to mine one ounce of silver as a primary metal, the cost associated with it is similar to the cost of mining one ounce of gold and with silver trading around \[$17 – $18\] an ounce and would not even be close to profitable when the mining costs are factored in. Currently we mine around six hundred million ounces of silver each year while industry consumes about eight hundred and seventy million ounces. Can you see a disparity developing? The market is tightening.

***TL;DR Read the constraints in supply, and this -> 130% of YEARLY silver harvested, is used in Industry!!***

I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States. 

Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member  of a national securities exchange -- **(2)**  To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, *a series of transactions* in any security registered on a national securities  exchange, any security not so registered, or *in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement* with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such  security, or **raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.""**

Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here

check this out

Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter, which can be investigated quite quickly, not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government.

Finally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that ""Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in  violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, **shall** be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price  which was affected by such act or transaction.""  


I am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest and is AGAINST THE LAW. You must act now before it is too late.

Sincerely,

Your Average Retail Investor
