How stupid are people that they can actually believe this? YEAH when I'm talking over collusion and market manipulation with the fucking white house I make sure all my IT people can hear me. YEAH totally normal for low-level people to know the intimate details of highly-sensitive conversations.

I can literally make a post right now that suggests that your mom traded a cut of that ass to robinhood to restrict buying gme and it would be just as credible. Hell it's even more plausible

MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS IS ANOTHER ATTACK. this post is getting spammed to drum up the narrative that this is an alt-right movement, by targeting the white house as the instigator of these holds. If this becomes viral, if we buy into this and start this whole conspiracy based on a single anonymous redditor, we will be forever associated with another retarded qanon conspiracy. we'll be irrelevant in a week.

Usually just for a laugh as I am a stodgy buy and hold guy and don't speculate often. When I saw the $GME shit happening a week ago I thought it was pure stupidity and was not planning on investing. In fact, I bought some $GME puts (which I've since sold since somehow they've gone up based on volatility) betting against the crowd here.

However, what has started as a decentralized short squeeze has morphed into a class movement. I'm a big populist and think we need big changes in this country, especially a transfer of wealth and power from the elites to the people. When this morphed into a class movement I became obsessed. However, I still wasn't going to buy in because I shy away from speculating on ultra risky stuff like this. But when Robinhood and all the other major brokerages colluded to cause a massive sell off, that's when it became a matter of principle. I've watched all day as the stock has remained relatively stable on very little volume. People are holding despite wall street twisting your arm and trying to make you tap out by only allowing you to sell. It's a beautiful thing to see.

36|l74q3s|IMPORTANT! Melvin and Citadel manipulated and organized a fake crash today on low volume and are likely out of their old most dangerous short positions|t3_l74q3s|0.91|10266|10266|hot|2021-01-28 21:38:22.000000|StalksYouEverywhere|681|Discussion|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l74q3s/important_melvin_and_citadel_manipulated_and/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l74q3s/important_melvin_and_citadel_manipulated_and/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l74q3s/important_melvin_and_citadel_manipulated_and/|"Disclaimer: **I'm still long GME** 💎🙌🏻 🚀🚀🚀

**This is potentially a market manipulation conspiracy of the highest order, here is what potentially happened today with the crash:**

**1)** Citadel conspires with Brokers (Who are dependant on citadel securities for their business) to **BAN the buying of GME stock**, but continue to **allow only selling** 

**2)** Hedge funds or Citadel use high frequency trading algorithms to **artificially create downwards pressure on the stock price** through increasingly lower bids (Faked market movement transactions between two parties to themselves or an intermediary) - 

❗❗❗**This strategy is only possible due to low volume, and low volume is created because INVESTORS LITERALLY CANT BUY THE STOCK BECAUSE BROKERS BANNED BUYING IT**❗❗❗

**3)** **Most Retail investors are unable to buy the now highly discounted shares during the crash**, they are only able to sell or buy in when the crash is already over and shorts covered. People see that the stock price went from 450$ to 150$ and a mass selloff panic makes a bunch of people sell their stock. Frequent halts only allow for 10-15s of selling on the way down increasing panic.

**4)** **SINCE RETAIL INVESTORS CANT BUY ANY GME STOCK, WHO BUYS ALL THESE PANIC SOLD GME SHARES? FUCKING HEDGE FUNDS THATS WHO**, every stock sold during the drop and at the bottom is not bought by normal investors, its bought by hedge funds to cover their shorts

**5)** Hedge funds cover their shorts on the way to the bottom at 120$ closing their positions at a lower loss. 

**6)** Now they buy call options and stop manipulating the stock price downwards, natural market forces create a bounce making their calls worth more -> they sell these calls immediately to recoup further losses made on their shorts

**7)** Hedge funds successfully exited their positions at a  much lower loss at the bottom of the crash or highly reduced their losses. 

**8)** If they're ever bigger greedy fucks **Hedge funds can now RE-BORROW shares at fucking dirt-cheap prices** now that they've neutrally closed their heavily in the red positions and repeat the same thing again, or just not get back in the game

-------------------------

**SOME BIG PLAYERS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY BEHIND THIS MARKET MANIPULATION ARE MOST LIKELY OUT OF THEIR MOST DANGEROUS NAKED SHORTS, THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT SHORT % HAS DECREASED THOUGH, IT COULD BE REPLACED BY NEW SHORTS FROM OTHER HEDGE FUNDS ETC. .**

The one holding the bag in the end wont be Melvin or Citadel, it'll be random retail investors and smaller funds.


-----------------

**This is clearly a parody, all similarities with real life situation is purely a coincidence, I don't want to get sued**

-----------------

**EDIT 0:**

❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗**OKAY AGAIN FOR THE RETARDS IN THE BACK** ❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗

**Q:WHY TOTAL SHORTS ARE STILL OVER 100%, BUT SOME BIG PLAYERS PROBABLY ALREADY COVERED**

**THERE ->IS NOT<- ONLY 1 PERSON/FUND/INSTITUTION SHORTING 100%+ OF THE STOCK. ITS HUNDREDS OF HEDGE FUNDS AND INVESTORS AND INSTITUTIONS. THE SHORTS COULD DECREASE BY 5% AND THATS ENOUGH FOR A BIG EXIT FOR SOME PLAYERS, LIKEWISE 10% OF OLD SHORTS COULD EXIT, AND 20% NEW SHORTS WOULD ENTER AND SHORT AND THE SHORTED FLOAT WOULD GO UP 10% WHILE STILL ALLOWING OLD SHORTS TO EXIT THEIR POSITIONS, SHORT FLOAT STAYING THE SAME OR INCREASING DOESNT MEAN THAT SOME HEDGE FUNDS DIDNT CLOSE THEIR OLD EXTREMELY RISKY POSITIONS**

**IM NOT SAYING THAT THE ENTIRE SHORT POSITION ON GAMESTOCK IS CLOSED. ITS NOT, IT'S STILL OVER 100% I'M JUST SAYING THAT A FEW SPECIFIC !BIG! PLAYERS WHO WERE SHORT MOST LIKELY EXITED THEIR MOST RISKY SHORT POSITIONS BY POTENTIALLY ARTIFICIALLY CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR A CRASH**

**IF A FEW HEDGE FUNDS SHORTED A FEW SMALL % OF THE TOTAL FLOAT AND COVERED AT THE BOTTOM OF TODAYS CRASH THE TOTAL FLOAT SHORTED WOULDN'T CHANGE MUCH BUT A FEW KEY PLAYERS COULD BE OUT OF THEIR POSITIONS, LIKEWISE NEW SHORTS COULD BE REPLACING OLDER ONES WITH CHEAPER SHORTS**

-------------------------

Edit1:

**FURTHER ASK YOURSELF:**

**IF CITADEL AFFILIATED STOCK BROKERS WERE REALLY PROTECTING RETAIL INVESTORS DUE TO ""RISK"" WHY DIDNT THEY BAN BUYING AND SELLING?** 

**THEY BANNED BUYING ONLY, HELPING THEIR HEDGE FUND BUDDIES DRIVE THE PRICE DOWN TO COVER SHORTS**

**AND ONLY RETAIL INVESTORS WERE BANNED FROM BUYING, HEDGE FUNDS COULD STILL BUY NORMALY**

**MEANING THAT THE HEDGE FUNDS HAD FIRST PICK ACCESS TO BUY THE SHARES TO COVER THEIR SHORTS, THESE SAME SHARES WOULD NORMALLY BE BOUGHT BY RETAIL INVESTORS MAKING IT MORE EXPENSIVE FOR SHORTS TO COVER**

__________________________________________________________

Edit2:

**SHORTED STOCK % MIGHT NOT CHANGE MUCH DUE TO EITHER NEW SHORTS BUYING IN, OR OLD SHORTS NOW SHORTING IN A MUCH CHEAPER WAY - NOW THAT THEY GOT RID OF THEIR MOST DANGEROUS SHORT POSITIONS**

**ALL SHORTS MIGHT NOT BE CLOSED, BUT THIS MARKET MOVE WAS ARTIFICIALLY CREATED TO COVER AT MINIMUM THE MOST OVER-LEVERAGED AND RISKY SHORT POSITIONS THESE FUNDS TOOK ON THEMSELVES**

___________________________________________________________

EDIT3:

**THE PRICE CRASHED ALMOST 400$ ON LIKE 10%-20%  OF THE USUAL TRADING VOLUME, DOES THIS LOOK LIKE ""NATURAL"" MARKET BEHAVIOUR TO YOU?**

**IF THIS WAS A NATURAL STOCK CRASH THE VOLUME WOULD BE RELATIVELY HIGH, BUT INSTEAD THE STOCK PRICE DROPPED 70-80% ON 1/10TH OF USUAL TRADING VOLUME. THAT IS ALMOST A GUARANTEED SMOKING GUN THAT THE PRICE HAD BEEN ARTIFICIALLY MANIPULATED**

EDIT 4:

Ask yourself why the market dipped yesterday despite fantastic earnings reports coming out

Answer: Funds were liquidating their other stock market positions to be able to close our their shorts with this market attack today

Why did the markets rally today during the GME crash?

Because the funds re-bought into their old positions in various companies now that they've closed their shorts and no longer at risk of bankruptcy and have additional capital available

You do realize you're fucking with the most irrational collection of individuals in the entire market, right? We're used to red days. Most of us are colorblind and can't tell the difference anyways. Some literally get off on loss, others are completely desensitized to it. Many of us have been in this shit since $10-$40. Conviction is way too strong to sell at a measly $130. That ladder was pretty sick today, ngl, you might've grabbed some paper handers/newblood, but do you think we're fucking BLIND? WE CAN SEE THE TRADING VOLUME. Even though many of us can't buy today, good luck finding enough sellers. Once the floodgates are open, WE LIKE THE STOCK, so people will buy the hell out of it.

&#x200B;

We all just got screwed by Robinhood's screwup here. I'm friends with a lawyer who says we have a good case for a class action lawsuit.

&#x200B;

Everyone comment here if you have/had shares or calls in GME held in Robinhood at market open today.

&#x200B;

Let's show these guys the system can't fuck with us!

&#x200B;

Edit:

Everyone take screenshots of Robinhood's app saying you can't buy, or blocking your orders.

Edit the 2nd:

Wheeeew lads let's get on it! I'll go through all these pms and comments this afternoon with my lawyer friend. Keep em coming!

And please share!

Edit 3:

OMFG guys I'm getting 1000s of PMs! It'll take a while to sort through them all and reply, but keep messaging and sharing! Also if you were using WeBull or some other brokerage and got blocked, you might as well join too.

My team and the lawyers had a conference call, and it's on! 

We'll have an update in the next 48 hours with the procedures and next steps. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please PM me and I'll try to get through as many as I can once we have more details.

This post was just out of frustration and memes over RHs bullshit corruption; I am not a laywer nor am I claiming that i'm going to create a class action by creating this post. You retards do as you wish, feel free to join if you want. Hell, use it as a backup in case something happens to WSB, I don't give a fuck

Edit: Stop giving me these beautiful awards you retards, use the money on GME. 

This is the way. 💎🙌💎. GME GANG FOREVER 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 STRAIGHT TO THE Nth DIMENSION BOYS 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit 2: I will be acquiring more shares today. I have 17.7k liquid money in my TD. Bought 15 shares @327. Waiting for another dip to yolo 12.7k into the rest. I have 18 shares holding on RH with average cost of $112. 1000EOD Boys. Fuck the shorts, fuck the establishment. Melvin and friends can suck my fat diamond encrusted cock. Don't forget to leave RH a nice review on the app store thanking them for your gains

Edit 3: I convinced my mother to yolo her stocks into GME early on @90. She still continues to add onto it and as of now she holds 147+ shares and is profiting well over 60k. I don't know what her cost average currently sits at but if my mother can 💎🙌💎 then so can you. She's more diamond-handed than me. Do your part brothers. We'll all be feasting on tendies from our golden plates and washing it down with Shitron tears as we wipe our asses with Melvin bucks by end of next week.

Edit 4: I can't believe how much this is blowing up. I wasn't expecting it. But while I have the spotlight, I just wanted to thank every single one of you from the bottom of my heart. You tards have done absolute wonders for the community and started a financial revolution fueled by memes and autism.
 I read all these stories about how this community has helped people pay off their debts, care for sick loved ones, allowed people to give back to their local communities, and so much more. You guys are the true unsung heroes of this generation and are some of the most wholesome degenerates i've ever seen. This fight isn't about just tendies anymore, its about justice and equality, it's about sticking it to the corporate elites who run the world. Don't let these greedy scumbags take what's rightfully yours, for too long the little guy has been pushed and shoved around but now it's our time to shine. Keep up the good fight and don't back down. 💎🙌💎 for days boys, WE WILL NOT STOP UNTIL WE SEE ELON SHOOT A GME THEMED ROCKET FILLED WITH THE BURNT ASHES OF THESE BASTARDS TO MARS. FUCK SHORTS. THIS ONE IS FOR THE HISTORY BOOKS! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 GME 5,000 IS NOT A MEME NOW. POWER TO THE PLAYERS!

EDIT 5: Stop spamming me with awards and upvotes, you retards are crashing my inbox! Put forth all this glorious energy into GME.

Update:

Reached out to 10 Security Litigation Firms I will update you when I hear back.

Email below:

 *Hello XX,*

*Current market manipulation is going on. GME. BB. and a few other stocks are only allowed to be sold and not purchased on platforms.*  


*CITADEL pays Robinhood for their order flows which makes up 40% of their revenue. CITADEL has huge short positions that have been getting crushed the last 4 weeks due to retail traders like myself.*  


*Robinhood and CITADEL are colluding to drive the price down by not allowing anyone else to purchase shares of those stocks.*  


*There are 100's of thousands of people getting screwed including me where I'm not able to buy and average my cost down.*  


*Robinhood TOS allows them to suppress stocks, but it is illegal when colluding with a Hedge fund to manipulate volume in favor of their shorts.*  


*Open to discussing what options I have from class action to suing on my own.*  

*Thank you!*

Update 2: response from 1 law firm working on it.

Good Morning xxx, 

I am responding to the inquiry we received from you via FindLaw to Anthony Harwood of Harwood Law PLLC. As Tony's assistant, and I field all the initial inquiries for legal representation, and you requested to be contacted via email. Would you please provide more information regarding your potential claim.

Robinhood began to restrict retail investors from buying Gamestop and other stocks (AMC, Blackberry, etc.) this morning, while hedge funds are still able to trade these stocks. Please confirm, and can you estimate your potential losses as a result of not being able to buy shares at this time? 

What is the firm that you believe poses a conflict of interest for Robinhood and what is the conflict? 

Were you notified of the decision to limit buys by Robinhood? If so, how and when? 

Please provide any additional information that you think might be helpful in providing a fuller understanding of your situation, and we will get back to you promptly. 

Best Regards,

Update 3 My response:

Good Morning Karin,

Thanks for getting back to me. My answers in black below.

Robinhood began to restrict retail investors from buying Gamestop and other stocks (AMC, Blackberry, etc.) this morning, while hedge funds are still able to trade these stocks. Please confirm, and can you estimate your potential losses as a result of not being able to buy shares at this time? I'm currently down over $20,000 and lost out on over $500,000. I have made a post to gauge peoples losses and they are in the 100s of millions.

What is the firm that you believe poses a conflict of interest for Robinhood and what is the conflict? Robinhood is connected with CITADEL. CITADEL Hedge Fund is shorting these stocks and have lost 2-3 billion the last couple weeks due to the short squeeze. I have also read it seems to be a colluded effort by a number of brokers to block buying and only allowing selling of these specific stocks that CITADEL has interest in.. IBKR, TD, and CS seem to be working in unison to manipulate the market.

Were you notified of the decision to limit buys by Robinhood? If so, how and when? Not until 11:30am this morning where they sent a notification. You would not see the notification without pressing around the app. The notification only stated ""due to ongoing volatility some securities like AMC and GME are position closing only"". So basically they are only allowing people to sell their shares driving the price down to benefit the funds that are shorting the stock...

Please provide any additional information that you think might be helpful in providing a fuller understanding of your situation, and we will get back to you promptly. I have a few thousand people that want to join a class action lawsuit. A number of individuals are already reaching out to other law firms across the country. If you see the current news financial titants, congress members, and many others are commenting on the collusion market manipulation that is taking place on Robinhood.

I'm working to gather more information but the damages can be in the billions..

Millions of people suppressed by the 1% are coming out in droves to fight back. To take back a small, but significant piece of what we’ve help build. We’ve lined the pockets of the greedy corporations, who have exploited the working class. In 1965, CEO employee ratio was 21:1, today it is 320:1 and rising.
This move has provided an opportunity for new and veteran retail traders to regain some of that capital back.

This forum’s open and transparent dialogue has helped people pay off loans, make their rent payments, and perhaps get back on their feet after a horrific and painful 2020. It’s time the world gets to enjoy some tendies. Today, some kid’s $2k to $50k trade can help him regain some footing. Perhaps he can buy something supporting a small business or even start his own. 

This forum has transformed the economic narrative. Short traders pushing to bankrupt businesses at 138% of a company’s value will forever need to reconsider their moves. America was built on the backs of hard working people. Many of these people still work at some of these companies earning minimal pay. Shorts like this puts more people out of work and further into debt further suppressing their ability to make a sustainable living. Billion dollar hedge funds will need think twice about trying to bulldoze America simply for the benefit of a few.

Many of us grew up with some of these companies. Companies like GameStop and AMC are part of
Americana. Sure, you may not have liked the $3 trade in for your game or perhaps you always wondered if the popcorn attendant came in your bucket, but fuck did you not still enjoy the movie experience. Other’s like Nokia and BB helped transform the way we communicate, share and communicate today. Way before we would browse Reddit while shitting, we were playing snake on our 6160. BB was, and still is Canadian. We hated their phones, but love our neighbors. These companies, who have lived among the most shorted companies, finally tells corporate greed that their game stops. 

So, to my fellow autist, as we rise this morning and gain further momentum, get ready to B.A.N.G. hard. There’s no time to slow fuck this. Get up, stay hard, and seize fucking the day. Our time has come.

I like the stocks, but LOVE you all."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165050.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['CEO', 'AMC', 'BB', 'BB', 'B', 'A', 'N', 'G', 'I', 'LOVE']|['CEO', 'AMC', 'B', 'N', 'G']

As you can see there are 69.75M outstanding shares of which 46.89M shares are float (meaning they are available on the market to trade, other shares are held by the GME corp, CEO etc). The Shares (short) as of Jan 14 2021 shows  61.78M shares short. Meaning when there are only 46.89M shares available on the market, the shorted shares are more than the available ones. They need your shares to get out of their short positions. They have shorted more shares then the number of shares which exist. If you people HOLD or BUY more shares, the higher the value goes once the squeeze happens (When their short contracts expire, they would have to buy. If there are no shares to buy, the price goes to the Moon and beyond because of simple demand and supply. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Today was a ladder attack which showed very low volume when the stock was halted. It was there to scare off investors. Everyone should keep their shares held to themselves and buy more at any given price. May Gamestop be the most valuable company for a while on the squeeze just like Volkswagen did back in 2008.

&#x200B;

P.S ignore people who are buying BB, AMC, NOK because they think there may be a squeeze with those companies too or think they are too late to jump into GME squeeze. Remember, the squeeze will happen eventually. Volkswagen squeeze took almost 2 years, but GME will be wayyyy quicker because of the spread of the news and the sheer amount of people jumping in.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Buy GME in any way or HOLD it if you cant buy more.

&#x200B;

P.S: This is not financial advice. I LIKE THE STOCK THATS WHY I AM BUYING IT.

We all, or most of us, knew they were going to play dirty when shit starts going south for them. Friday is close. They are shitting themselves because that's the make-or-break point most likely.

Tomorrow is going to be a bloodbath, be ready for it. You may see the price swing to stupid lows but if we don't sell there's nothing they can do about it unless try more dirty tricks. 

Be prepared for the possibility that your apps like RH may have problems paying out your tendies when its all said and done. They are all in this together.

The shorts lost $14.3 bn just in January on GME. Think about it. That's the entire GDP of a smaller country like Albania or Armenia.

Whatever happens on Friday, know that we hold all the shares they need to cover their short positions and if we don't sell they'll bleed out

We need to switch away of their platform because they clearly do not act in our best interests. Rather, they aim to keep the rich in power while proclaiming to ""democratizing"" the markets. Actions speak louder than words and it is clear they never intended to allow the regular folks from benefiting by partaking in the markets.

Therefore, I suggest that we switch to other brokerage platforms that also offer free stock trading (options may not be free) and make sure that Robinhood's IPO becomes a bust. If their DAU, MAU, and other performance metrics that ties into their valuation drops, we will have sent a clear signal to the world that the billionaire institutions and all their cronies do not get to unfairly tip the scales in their favor any longer.

Congratulations! You have officially become important enough to target. 

We're seeing lots of ""reports"" that Citadel is behind Robinhood's decision to manipulate the market. I think that's very plausible. But you need to focus on things that we know, because there is no such thing as a half truth -- things are either true or false. **If you get swept up in a half-truth, you're really getting swept up in a lie. And when you're swept up in a lie, suddenly you aren't credible anymore.** 

**Standard information control play:**

- Do something bad

- Release believable information ""anonymously"" pinning the bad thing on a believable target, perhaps even the real bad guy

- But although that information is believable... make sure it's false.

- Congratulations, you have just created a wacko conspiracy theory! Now you can dispatch with any serious allegations about your wrongdoing by calling your detractors crazy conspiracy theorists.

**Focus on what we KNOW:**

- Robinhood stopped all buy orders on GME, causing the price to immediately plummet and giving Wall Street enough breathing room to cut some losses and reduce their collective float % from 140% to 120% (still VERY MUCH in Big Squeeze territory babyyyyy!)

- If Robinhood had some strategy in place to confront volatile markets, then it should have activated that strategy yesterday when volume was even larger.

- If Robinhood was worried about margined up retards exposing them to risk, then they could have stopped all trades on margin; they had no reason whatsoever to stop all buy orders.

- Robinhood did not stop trading before the market opened -- they only stopped trading after we hit our (local) peak (still going to the moon, HOLD!).

- **Therefore, something happened between yesterday and today's rally that made Robinhood decide to stop all trades. The only reason I can think up is to suppress price for a nefarious purpose.**"|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165050.csv|StockTicker|['LCOME', 'TO', 'THE', 'ANGER']|[]|['I', 'GME', 'VERY', 'MUCH', 'HOLD', 'I']|['GME']

Please make this known and be on the lookout for a future update on details on how to join. We cannot allow them to get away with this unscathed. This is NOT a free market.

Edit 1 - Small update on actions taken so far:

1. Messaged Robinhood first asking them to stop. No response, obviously.
2. Filed an official complaint with the SEC. No response as of yet.
3. Called an attorney who specializes in class action lawsuits. Left a voicemail with him. Also called his paralegal who I also had to leave a message with.

Edit 2 - Heard back from my lawyer, we should have something officially filed by noon today. I don't know if the chance to sign on comes then or a while after but I'll let you all know.

Just so everyone knows, I'm also including BB, AMC, and NOK in this if I can, as well as other trading platforms such as Webull. Not sure if they'll get lumped in the same lawsuit or broken into subs. Just know that we hear you and will include you. If there are any other stocks or trading platforms affected please let me know via DM and I'll try to get them on the list.

You are being heard. Don't give up.

Edit 3 - I've currently removed TD Ameritrade from the list as I was informed in a comment below that trading is still allowed there. If that isn't the case, someone DM me.

Edit 4 - I've been informed that, if the lawsuit picks up, it will likely be consolidated to the location Robinhood does business (California, USA). I mentioned to my lawyer that this has become a global issue as evidence by those outside the USA commenting below. I'm currently concerned that I may not be able to include these areas in the suit and encourage you to file your own complaints as well. I'll keep pushing the issue, just wanted to let you all know.

Edit 4 - Thank you all for your attention and participation. Also, a special thanks to those asking to donate to the cause, but I have been informed that there will be no legal fees directly billed to me in regard to this suit so the only cost to me will be time, energy, and stock losses obviously. No need for donations, but I appreciate the sentiment.

Edit 5 - Looks like we're playing a waiting game at this point. The suit was filed earlier this morning but due to the insane amount of other suits being filed for the same thing, this will probably end up getting eaten up by one of the other higher profile versions. That said, don't stop fighting, record all evidence, and make sure they can't get away with this. 

Many people have messaged me with additional stocks and platforms affected, I see them, there are just too many to add to this post at the time. The lawyer will get all the evidence regardless. I'm told that it could be quite some time before anything comes to fruition here so I apologize to anyone and everyone waiting in agony as I am.

They told me that after a margin call is sent out eod, I would have 5 business days to close my positions. After today’s complete restriction on these stocks, including the selling of covered calls to hedge losses, I contacted a manager from TDA.

During the conversation, she initiated my margin call and sold 600 of my BB shares at $15 a share, leaving me at a SIGNIFICANT loss. She then told me that, “That’s just how we are handling this situation, you should have known the inherent risks of investing before making an investment.”

I was then promptly hung up on.

Sure, Webull¹ allows GME and NOK trades *now.* But they restricted before and they can easily do it again. We can't forget that these companies will sell our their customers to appease their handlers. Maybe we can't trust any of these companies. In fact, definitely we cannot.

Their strategy for doing this created (creates? Hard for me to tell if it still works since they've restricted my account so much) arbitrage opportunities on long-dated, OTM options on high-volume assets like SPY where you could buy single contracts at one cent above the bid and sell at one cent below the ask for instant profit. Here's my account for the past year, I'll let you guess when I discovered it:

[https://imgur.com/a/iGlkAPZ](https://imgur.com/a/iGlkAPZ)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Many of you are, very rightly, pissed off about Citadel getting Robinhood and other firms for restricting trading of GME and other stocks. Well, if you're interested in a little storytime (and possibly a way to say fuck you to Robinhood & Citadel), or just a break from strictly GME-related stuff, keep on reading.

Note: what follows is not intended to defame, simply my observations of behavior by Robinhood and my theory on why this behavior is happening.

Robinhood and Citadel have been fixing options prices together for at least a year (likely much longer). This morning I submitted a long-overdue complaint to FINRA (I reported to the SEC months ago with no response). The summary of my complaint is below.

The core of this behavior is the fact that Robinhood will, for certain stocks and ranges of options, fill orders at arbitrage-producing prices. These must be orders for single contracts, on high-volume assets like $SPY, and for options with wide bid-ask spreads. For example, $SPY 12/17/21 Calls >$400 have often fallen in this range. If you place orders for single options only, Robinhood would fill buy orders at a cent above the bid price and sell orders at a cent below the ask price, yielding an immediate profit. I describe why I think they do this in my complaint below.

If you've been paying close attention, a number of wsb users have discovered this behavior, and a few posted about it:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hmyajs/that\_sweet\_nkla\_arbitrage\_605\_in\_7082085\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hmyajs/that_sweet_nkla_arbitrage_605_in_7082085_out/)

(Other posts were made and later deleted. Search reddit for ""390 trades"" and you'll find people talking about this).

Robinhood obviously doesn't like you doing this, limits trade execution on your account, makes the order fills less profitable for your account, and eventually shuts your account down for a quarter. However, on accounts that don't yet have a pattern of placing many small trades, you can turn quite a profit before they catch onto you.

Because I'm not a financial advisor, I am NOT advising you to try this yourself to see if Robinhood will still let you fuck them over a bit.

&#x200B;

My FINRA complaint:

I have substantial reason to believe that Robinhood Securities LLC has orchestrated a large-scale fixing of option prices, possibly in conjunction with the third party market makers they sell order flow to, namely Citadel Securities (virtually all trades discussed below were routed to Citadel). This behavior has consistently occurred for a minimum of 9 months.

In April 2020 I noticed that orders for single options contracts, particularly on options with wide bid-ask spread, would frequently be filled on Robinhood at unusual prices: for buy orders, a single contract limit order set at one cent above the current bid would be filled, or sold at one cent below the ask price. This unusual for a number of reasons: a) this resulted in an abundance of arbitrage opportunities, allowing contracts to be bought then sold for immediate profit despite no change in the underlying asset, b) these odd fill prices only existed on Robinhood, no other broker, and c) only orders for single contracts would fill; 2 1-contract orders would fill at the bid price but a single 2-contract order would only fill at a more reasonable price, closer to the mark.

For a number of reasons I believe this to be the effect of a price-manipulation strategy by Robinhood (and possibly Citadel), which clearly crossed the line to illegallity. To begin with, their motive is clear: Robinhood is paid by market makers for options trades relative to the width of the bid/ask spread of the traded options. As such, they have a vested interest in keeping the spreads of options wide. This strategy of clearing small spread-reducing orders helps protect that income stream. This strategy is in violation of financial regulations, because filling single-contract orders for better prices than larger orders means Robinhood is not providing the best price available for a given option order.

Moreover, the actions they took to protect this strategy when I began exploiting its' shortcoming (the fact that it created small arbitrages for single-contract orders) were more explicitily illegal. After I showed a pattern of placing these single-contract orders, Robinhood massively reduced order execution speed for my account. Additionally, they began filling those single-contract orders at worse prices, for my account (and accounts of other traders with similar trading patterns) specifically. This was verified by having a new Robinhood user place the same orders as I did simultaneously, with the newer user consistently getting quicker fills at better prices. Eventually, Robinhood started blocking orders from my account unless I set the limit price to be above the current ask (for buy orders) or below the current bid (for sell orders), giving an error message if the limit price was any lower, holding my assets hostage unless I accepted a worse-than-market-price for them.

Finally, Robinhood resorts to citing a CBOE rule designating those placing more than 390 trades per day as professional traders as grounds for locking users with these trading patterns from opening new options positions for a quarter. Their citation of this rule here is questionable, as it only applies to trades routed to CBOE, and they do not route orders to an exchange. Moreover, CBOE agents confirmed that if they were properly enforcing this rule they would have to designate us as professional traders for crossing this threshold, which would mean position-closing orders would also not be allowed, so at a minimum Robinhood is either falsely citing this rule or not properly enforcing it.

When confronted about this activity Robinhood deflects and eventually stops responding to inquiries.

After much resistance I obtained a copy of my routing information from Robinhood (which they are required to disclose), which confirmed that 99% of such trades were routed to Citadel.

Several Robinhood users have experienced similar behavior."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165053.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['OTM', 'SPY', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'FINRA', 'I', 'SEC', '$SPY', '$SPY', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'NOT', 'FINRA', 'I', 'LLC', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'CBOE', 'CBOE', 'CBOE', 'I']|['GME', 'CBOE', 'CBOE', 'CBOE']

I would also like to preface this post with the fact that this is not a war on billionaires, the wealthy yada yada, but it may well be described as a resistance against injustice, inequiality, rigged rules, uneven playing field etc which has been rampant on Wall Street forever.

Billionaires are not baddies, at least not all of them. It's what they decide to do with their wealth that is the problem. Using one's wealth to perpetuate inequality and injustice is not cool. If all hedge funds were dismantled tomorrow, there will be absolutely no negative consequences to society or social fabric. Hedge funds are not the greatest capital allocators. In fact they are shit at it and the last couple of weeks have proven it.

Using wealth to propel humankind to become multiplanetary species, solving climate change, building infrastructure, promoting social capital, improving fairness, leveling the playing field that's super cool!

\------------------------------------------------

Now to the main part. What you fellow smooth-brains and soft-heads have discovered is called a 'market inefficiency' and you are correcting it. The market is acting exactly like it's intended to act. **You are not the problem, you are actually the solution.**

***Why fundamentals don't matter?***

Fundamentals stopped mattering the moment $GME's short interest breached 100% of the available float. See, markets should work as a two way function (you should be able to derive x from y and y from x). There is no possibility at all to buy more than 100% of the available float at any point in time, so why would it be possible to short more than 100% of the float? Why would the market allow such an asymmetric property? Well it shouldn't and the market would and is correcting that.

***So what does matter?***

What really matters now is first principles. Yes, exactly like Papa Elon resumes most of his thought processes as far away as possible from foolish abstractions (read 'fundamentals') down to first principles, this is exactly the same thing what the market is doing right now.

The fools at CNBC (fuck you Wapner - hope you are reading this), CNN, Boomerberg have described the price as being irrational, devoid of logic and reason. So let's break this down for them starting from first principles, Economics 101.

Supply and demand form the most crucial concepts of economics. Whether you are an academic, farmer, banker, hedge fund loser, smooth-brain redditor or a CNBC reporter, the basic premise of supply and demand equilibrium is integrated into your daily actions. Only after understanding the basics of this can the more complicated aspects be mastered.

So let's look at the demand and supply of $GME shares

Demand side:

* Bullish investors - it is no secret that a lot of the investors have taken a position after the narrative around $GME's business model and future prospects are significantly more optimistic with Ryan Cohen now in the driving seat. Now that brankruptcy is out of question, it is for each investor to judge and decide what the fair value for the stock is. I will leave this part to each one of you individually, as I am just a degenerate smooth-brain redditor that doesn't know shit.
* MMs (no, not market manipulators, just market makers) - these guys sold a ton of short-dated call options to you and haven't learned a shit from what happened last Friday. They are going exactly the same path this friday. There are now around 300k of OI that are ITM (probably more by end of today), which translates into 30M shares that need to be found to the option holders by EOD tomorrow.
* SS (no, not the nazi troops, just the short sellers) - yeah, you know exactly what's going on here, since this is the essence of the story. Short sellers borrowed around 70M shares and must get them at any price.

Supply side:

* Float - these are the shares that are openly traded and exchange hands every day. Around 51M shares (probably less since you all have diamond hands)
* Share issuance - the company can decide to issue new shares. I believe $GME shelf issuance ammount is around $100M. At yesterday's share price of $347, that's only 0.3M shares. But let's round up to 1M

So what do we get:

Demand = 30M from MMs + 70M from SSs + 10M from bullish investors (this number is out of thin air, I have no clue what it should be). **Total demand: 110M**

Supply = 51M from float + 1M from share issuance. **Total supply: 52M**

Demand / Supply ratio: 2.1x

I will let CNBC, Boomerberg, CNN find another security, commodity, bond or whatever that has that demand / supply ratio and then make a judgement on the price for $GME shares.

Finally, *the invisible hand* is a metaphor introduced by the 18th-century Scottish philosopher and economist Adam Smith, characterizes the unseen forces that move the free market economy. It is that very invisible hand that came back to slap the shit out of the 'masters of the universe' hedge funds that decided to ignore the most basic principles of economics.

If any of the hedge fund dementors read this, note that the free market will always, always humble you and put you back where you belong. Fuck you!

This is an extension of my DD series on GME. If you haven’t read them and have time, they will provide some background on my previous predictions, some of which have already come true. In this post, I’ll share my thoughts on what I think is going on, plus some tips to manage your positions and exits. 

**TL;DR:** Shorts are in but likely want to get out. And they want to get out at the best price possible. See tips for managing positions.

# What’s happening with the price? 

### We’re still gamma squeezing

Many media outlets are reporting this as a “short squeeze”. They’re only partially right, as [if Melvin isn’t lying they’ve already been squeezed out](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-stock-short-sellers-melvin-capital-citron-surrender-bets-gme-2021-1-1030010382). 

However, the reality is so far we’ve been Gamma squeezing - repeatedly - and some shorts have been casualties along the way. 

See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/) for a deeper explanation, but the essence of it is that market-makers have to buy shares to hedge the calls they sell. The more calls people buy, the more shares they MMs have to hedge with. As I explained in [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/), GME has ultra low liquidity, i.e. there’s **waaaay fewer actively traded shares than what shorts need to buy to cover with**, and then when you get lots of people buying calls and shares in the hot new stock it just **removes more availability** from the market. 

As a result, when MMs buy shares to hedge, it moves the price of the underlying up. Combine that with the buying pressure of people piling into a stock climbing 100% a day, shorts getting liquidated, and it’s a perfect storm. 

Today, GME closed at $347 (before the after market selloff, but i’ll get to that soon). 

320 calls were added yesterday. Similarly, when 115cs were added we squeezed to >115 in two days. Same story with 60c’s etc.

Remember this commentary from [EndGame part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l528pz/gme_endgame_part_3_a_new_opponent_enters_the_ring/) on Friday’s price action:

*Notice how the stock dropped from a high of $75 on Friday to below 60 - the highest expiring SP for the 1/22 options, and* ***stayed tight in range for the rest of the day****. Now, for compliance reasons, MM are required to be neutral by EOD, so 20 minutes before close, MMs had to buy back all their short positions, which led to the strong close above 60.*

*All this led me to believe that the* ***real fair market price for GME was above $65.*** *Without the market makers interference, GME would have closed higher.* 

Now, what happened today? We opened at **$351, more than double the previous close of $145** and after the morning profit taking, we squeezed to a **high of $372** as MMs furiously tried to hedge the 320 calls they sold you the day before for peanuts. 

See, the thing is, [Kenny G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_C._Griffin) doesn’t like to lose money. The magical method Citadel’s market makers make money, is that they sell you call giving you the right to buy shares at a certain price, say $320, for the nice price of $10/share (for example). Now, as long as Citadel’s MMs can buy all the shares they have to give to you for less than $320, that $10 is free money. However, when the underlying moves too fast, the MMs have to buy shares for more than $320, and **Kenny G does not like that.** 

Today was a shock to the MMs that sold all the 320cs yesterday. A ***six-sigma event after a six-sigma event after a six-sigma event***. Yet again, within days (a day?) of offering new, higher strikes - **every call option ever sold was in the money, before they had a chance to adequately hedge.**  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cq5wy45433e61.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c75a1e1a6e3808b54bafc646e2e6a7f29ca7cc3

So, just as on Friday, if the price got too high above **$320**, market makers dug into their bag of tricks to start selling it off. (People taking profits here helped too.) However, multiple times, when GME went **below $300**, MMs took their opportunity to hedge the 1/29 calls. So, just as before, *we traded in a tight range around the highest strike.* 

My conclusion from this action the first time was that **GME’s fair price was being actively suppressed**, and **it proceeded to 5x** in the next few days. There’s a possibility we’re in a replay and will see more upward movement on delta hedging alone.  

The point of this is: I think shorts are feeling the squeeze, for sure, reporting [massive mark-to-market losses**.** ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-short-sellers-squeezed-losses-reddit-traders-army-cohen-palihapitiya-2021-1-1030006226) **But I believe the shorts are still in.**

### Shorts are still in

As of Wednesday morning, Ortex was estimating a **short interest of 65M shares**, down from 71M shares the day before.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ze8wx15633e61.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a034dbb3c54509c6267f20c4122ecdf3f6cf4bc

If you’ve read my Part 1 ([DTC Infinity](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/)), you’ll hopefully recall my thesis that there are actually less than **24M** shares available, and therefore that it would be nigh impossible for shorts to close. Since then a slew of new investors have piled in to **buy and hold** GME, from little guys like us to big-ass-whales like [Blackrock](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000083423721001340/us36467w1099_012621.txt) **increasing their holdings to** **13% of GME.**

So what? I think the available shares for shorts to buy **are down to under 20M, and they have to buy 65M shares to close**. *Shorts have barely begun to cover.* We’ve only been increasing the cost of their exits!

Now, let’s talk about Melvin Capital. I loved watching Chamath defend retail investors and argue against the institutional leveraged shorting that got us here in the first place, but I also learned something interesting that helped me understand how the 140% short interest had in the first place, and how the unwinding may go. 

At [2:10 Chamath says](https://youtu.be/DYZHtF-tV0k?t=135) “*Gabe Plotkin is one of the giants of our era, but at the end of the day, what happens is that his trades are copied by umpteen other hedge funds that follow along* ” 

This tells me 2 things:

* A lot of hedge funds (likely [Maplelane](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/hedge-fund-maplelane-loses-about-33-on-short-bets-this-month), [D1](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/dan-sundheim-s-20-billion-d1-capital-loses-about-20-this-month), [Viking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_Global_Investors), [Point72](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/business/point72-gamestop.html), and more) followed each other into this short. Much like retards like us get behind good DD shared in the open, these institutional retards got together with their cigars and golf clubs behind closed doors and decided together to go in together against GME. 
* If Melvin is really out, it’s unlikely the other funds are going to want to stay in, lest they be compared poorly to Melvin if GME continues to go against them. **The other shorts want out.**

Chamath also tells us that prime brokers (the brokers that hedge funds use) are seeing [**“the biggest 4-day degrossing from hedge funds they’ve ever seen”.**](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354646282678149127?s=21)

**Again, the problem is - there just aren’t enough shares.** Shorts have dug themselves a massive grave by shorting more shares in existence and continuing to short while Cohen grabbed up 9M shares, institutions added to their positions, and retail traders piled in.

For [**boomers like this tard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgYZk9Mc804) that can’t understand why the price is so high - go back to Econ 101, supply and demand bitch. 

# It’s costing shorts incredible $ to hold their positions

Here’s all the ways shorts are losing money.

* They pay borrow fees to loan the stock. At one point today, the GME stock borrow fee [hit 250%](https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1354646088221913089) for new borrows. At $300/share that’s $2/day. That doesn’t sound like much right? What if you shorted at $50? 
* The short position on GME has ballooned to **$25BN from a low of $1B.** *The borrow fees are applied to the latest closing price, not the price you shorted at.* 
* Funds are paying **interest fees on the margin they are using for the short**
* And oh yeah, GME’s up like 800% in 5 days. 

# Dirty tactics continue

At this point, I think “THEY” have figured out that gamma squeezes are absolutely destroying hedge funds. So what do they do? 

* **THE BIGGEST DIRTIEST TACTIC OF ALL - they only allow you to sell, not buy. HEY SEC, WHY ARE SHORTS STILL ALLOWED TO SHORT WHEN LONGS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BUY. WHY ARE INSTITUTIONS ALLOWED TO COLLUDE?**
   * **This is insane. Funds, prime brokerages, and market makers all stood to lose money so they disabled trading of GME due to ""volatility"". Citadel invests in Melvin capital. Then brokerages shut down buying!**
* Brokerages down
* Options not loading
* Restrict retail trading on GME
   * **I’m seeing reports that retail buyers not allowed to hold more than 100 GME options now**
   * &#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/is4qn8n733e61.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=741f80fc182e27584954691ebb581ffee15f86ef

* This is a direct defense against more gamma squeezes and an **attack on retail investors, giving institutions a distinct advantage.** 
* **HEY Shortsellers Enrichment Corporation** \- how is it ok for [Citron to buy thousands of puts minutes before their tweet](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) and how is it ok for prime brokers to give hedge funds 10-100x leverage, but the little guys can’t have more than 100 options total?  
   * Personally, I don’t really do 100s of options all at once but now I really want to. Fuck this. 
* More short ladder attacks. Look at after-hours trading on GME - a rapid short ladder attack during low-volume trading in order to bring the price down. 
* **If you use stop losses on GME and leave them on, you will get stop-loss hunted.** 

&#x200B;

Ripple effects of the squeeze

* These hedge funds that are short GME, are also short other equities like BBBY, AMC, etc. 
* These hedge funds are also long other shares with leverage, so the ONLY way they’re staying alive and not covering their shorts, is that they’re **reducing their long leverage. This means selloffs in the broader market** as they have to shore up their margin requirements against the massive short squeezes in their portfolios.

# I believe we’re at a tipping point

* I don’t believe shorts have really covered yet. They have defended by getting capital infusions and reducing their long leverage. I.e. they have begun liquidating long positions. 
* If GME climbs more, they will be **forced to cover and liquidate.** 

# Things to be careful about

As you can see, this is no easy win. In addition to the [suggestions I wrote about in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/), here’s some things to be careful about. 

* **There are threats to halt trading. Shares are safe, they do not expire. Calls can be destroyed by tactics like buying halts.** 
* **Be careful about swapping ITM calls for OTM calls:** it can be tempting to trade-up your options for higher return, but be mindful of the delta impact. You may actually be driving the sale of shares by MMs when you don’t mean to. For example, if you sell a .5 delta call for 2 .2 delta calls, that’s net reduction of 10 shares that MMs have to hold long as leverage. 
* **Be careful about being short any calls this week:** Not only do you limit your upside (which is dumb in the prospect of a squeeze), you could end up in a nightmare scenario. A call that ends OTM on Friday could end up ITM after hours if you didn’t sell it, and you may get assigned while the underlying continues to go up. **Close spreads if your short legs are deep ITM** unless you want to risk early assignment and high hard-to-borrow fees. 
* **There are a few other dirty tactics shorts can play.** I’m not specifically going to share them here because I don’t want to give the ideas circulation, but 
   * **Choose your own limit sells based on personal sell points.** Don’t copy others and don’t try to be memey. Make your own decisions. 
   * **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it’s an **attack vector** for you. 
* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn’t resume for the rest of the day? **All your 1/29 calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you’re taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration. 
* **Be careful about buying on margin.** Brokers are rapidly increasing margins. If you bought on margin with 2:1 leverage, and the stock went up 100%, you’d be in margin call even without a margin change. If the broker moves margin against you, you’ll get to margin call faster. 
* **Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose.** I’ve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing (remember last Monday with the short sale restriction?), you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I’ve held through multiple 30-40% drawdowns in the underlying; and **held through a 50% drawdown today**, so you need to be ready for the volatility. 
* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It’s common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you’ve set a stop loss, be really sure about it. 
* **Don’t sell on dips.** You’re only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when it’s heading up. Sell high, not low retards.
* **Save dry powder to buy on dips.** Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities. Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points. GME has incredible daily volatility. Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill. Have patience when buying.

This is not financial advice; do your own DD. I’m holding over $1M in shares and calls.  **I AM NOT SELLING WHEN THE BUYING MARKET HAS BEEN REMOVED. YOU ARE BOUND TO NOT GET A FAIR MARKET PRICE.**

**Update** New ortex data shows 51M short interest. So the covering has begun.

**Update 2:** what you are seeing in the price drops is likely the gamma squeeze in reverse. People are rightly selling their short term calls, so MMs are selling shares they bought to hedge. That drives the price down, which then causes more de-hedging. This is all a manufactured selloff by elimination of ability of people to buy the equity and should absolutely be investigated. It's very likely the big boys knew the buying restriction was coming and started the selloff last night.

**Update 3:** getting angrier by the minute. Reviewing the volume and price action and shorts bought in volume at the absolute bottom. This mothefucker, Steve Cohen, who bailed out Melvin and previously accused of insider trading is now GLOATING after this blatant trick https://twitter.com/StevenACohen2/status/1354864321134735360?s=09"|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165053.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['DD', 'GME', 'I', 'DTC', 'I', 'GME', 'HEY', 'SEC', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'SP', 'MM', 'EOD', 'GME', 'GME', 'C', 'G', 'A', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'M', 'M', 'DTC', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'M', 'M', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'DD', 'GME', 'GME', 'M', 'GME', 'GME', 'BN', 'B', 'I', 'THE', 'GGEST', 'TIEST', 'ACTIC', 'OF', 'ALL', 'HEY', 'SEC', 'WHY', 'ARE', 'HORTS', 'STILL', 'LOWED', 'TO', 'SHORT', 'WHEN', 'LONGS', 'ARE', 'NOT', 'LOWED', 'TO', 'BUY', 'WHY', 'ARE', 'TIONS', 'LOWED', 'TO', 'LLUDE', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'HEY', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'BBBY', 'AMC', 'ONLY', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'ITM', 'OTM', 'A', 'OTM', 'ITM', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'ITM', 'GME', 'GME', 'DD', 'M', 'I', 'AM', 'NOT', 'LLING', 'WHEN', 'THE', 'UYING', 'ARKET', 'HAS', 'BEEN', 'MOVED', 'YOU', 'ARE', 'BOUND', 'TO', 'NOT', 'GET', 'A', 'FAIR', 'ARKET', 'PRICE', 'M', 'ATING']|['DD', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'SP', 'MM', 'EOD', 'GME', 'GME', 'C', 'G', 'GME', 'M', 'M', 'GME', 'GME', 'M', 'M', 'DD', 'GME', 'GME', 'M', 'GME', 'GME', 'B', 'ALL', 'ARE', 'ARE', 'ARE', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'BBBY', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'DD', 'M', 'AM', 'HAS', 'ARE', 'M']

As most of you know, stocks can only go down to zero. So the profit for shorts is limited down to zero, and the loss for longs is limited to zero. When stocks go up, the profit for longs is limitless and the loss for shorts is also limitless, theoretically of course. So imagine being short, stuck in a massively losing position where if you push the price down, zero is the best payoff. Ironically this was the bet Melvin made before he got steamrolled by the internet.

But what about if you could go long? The sky is the limit and could theoretically cover more of your losses than trying to go back to zero. $GME closed at $193 today, so if they're still in the hole, all they can try is pushing it to zero and dig the hole deeper which seems like a dumb plan. So this is what I think they're going to do.

Yesterday, the CEO of the Nasdaq suggested a halt to trading to let institutions ""recalibrate"" their positions:

>Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman suggested Wednesday that her exchange could halt trading activity for stocks, in the event they were targeted by internet users, to enable the exchange to investigate possible manipulation and allow investors to “recalibrate.”

>https://www.mediaite.com/news/nasdaq-ceo-suggests-halt-to-trading-to-allow-big-investors-to-recalibrate-their-positions-to-combat-reddit-users/

What if a halt wasn't possible, but they needed a way to kill the momentum of retail buyers and allow $GME to fall? The best solution would be to cut off retail from purchasing/bidding up the price. That's all you need to do. Only let them sell or hold, which would contribute no pricing pressure at all or only downward pressure. This would allow hedge funds price control over $GME so they could move it lower with ladder attacks without having to worry about or battle with retail pushing against them. If anything retail would panic and sell. And thus today we saw a massive attack which brought $GME down over $350.

2.Some short covering has obviously taken place. Some Korean firm I think sold a few million shares they were long. It's a small dent but not enough to fix the problem. And the short volume is up markedly, while the short interest is still over 50 million shares. I've seen higher SI figures and I don't know how Ortex computes this, whether it includes naked shorts or not. But here's the updated graph:

https://i.imgur.com/jnf4ELe.png

So you can see they've covered some bets, probably the biggest losers shorting from like $30 or something. But they seem to have reloaded, as others here and on twitter have reported. **The short volume is up massively and days to cover is at its lower point ever.**

I've read that shorts have to return 30 million shares tomorrow. I have no idea if this is true, but if it is, it means the game is coming to an end and they need to close their position by buying which they will have to do eventually. So the final step after pushing $GME into the dirt and doing some short covering, is to setup positions to go long. $GME hit a low of $112 today. The best way for shorts out is to go long and to do so through derivatives, specifically cheap calls. As most of you know, the further out of the money a call is, the cheaper it is. Now I don't know what the $570 strike expiring tomorrow was trading at when $GME hit $112 (I just wish I had bought some). But it's currently less than $1k and was much cheaper earlier. And more importantly, over 12,000 of these were bought TODAY. Normally I'd attribute these 0DTE cheap moonshots to the retar, erm, traders here. But considering most of you can't buy right now, and that Robinhood has never allowed 0DTE options purchases, I have to think this was institutional buying:

https://imgur.com/DOqIA8T

Some people have mentioned holding through the weekend as calls would expire ITM. Wouldn't they want to avoid that by getting the squeeze done and over with so they expire OTM? Just a thought.

If I'm right, and the shorts have loaded up on 0DTE moonshot calls and are ready to stop playing games and exit, they will let this thing finally fly now that they can make a ton of money on the upside through calls.

The ride up will be swift and so will the ride back down. The best way for them to play this is to position themselves with calls at the bottom (today), then start the unloading of their short positions through buying and let it ride as high as they can to cover however deep they are. And once that ends, they will cash in the calls, which will cause MMs to sell off their delta-hedged shares behind those calls, shorts will stop buying any more shares, and probably short the price back down because they're greedy fucks. All of this would send the price plummeting right after a top. Fortunately we have circuit breakers now which I don't think existed back when VW went to the moon. Look at a chart of the VW Squeeze:

https://imgur.com/E5QShAp

See how the stock fell beforehand...probably to let shorts reposition themselves for the inevitable. Is that happening today? Maybe. The point is it's very violent up and then back down. The squeeze on VW all happened in one day, perhaps over hours or less. So you have to be ready.

How high does it go? I would expect anything above $500 is risky (but I dream of $1k+ like the rest of you). Whether they load up on $50 calls or $500 calls both will go up along with the price. You never know where the top is so have a game plan. The top is wherever they need it to be to get right with God (the banks backing them). So be ready and realistic. If you can't watch charts, set a sell limit (I know, I know). But please don't diamond hands major profits to nothing by going through a squeeze and not selling because you're also a greedy fuck. I've been a member of this autistic playground long enough to watch diamond hands go to zero, repeatedly. I nearly went extinct as a gay bear myself for diamond-handing puts into the summer after the market crashed in March.

19 Feb 21 $400 Call x 2
19 Feb 21 $150 Call x 3
20 shares (lol)

This is not financial advice and I'm no insider, just a retar...trader like the rest of you. Do not risk what you cannot afford to lose. Good luck.

# Background on Squeezes and Infinity Squeezes

Whats happening? GME is ready for an ""infinity squeeze"" a short squeeze, where over 100% of the float (tradable shares) are held short. 

What is a short squeeze? A short squeeze occurs when a heavily shorted stock rises quickly, and those who short the stock typically have to BUY their SHORTED shares back, to ""cover"" themselves. This buying creates a huge spike in the price. However, this is nothing compared to an infinity squeeze.

There are two recorded infinity squeezes in history. The more notable one was in 2008, and [ran VW from 200 to 1000](https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/) in a day. This was in 2008, during the financial crisis. The average family did not have a broker, and they were not trading. They were worried about losing their house. 

# GME

As of yesterday, GameStop was still shorted [over 122%](https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1354644868971245569?s=20).  There are [rumors of that now being at 250%](https://twitter.com/Chris2pherChase/status/1354792737074241538). At least half of that [must be covered tomorrow.](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=GME&submit=Short+Quote™) It says 2.X days, because Friday options technically expire on Saturday.

This means that over must be bought by tomorrow. They will need to physically ""rotate"" through the shares, buying the ENTIRE FLOAT, selling, and BUYING THE OTHER 22% of it.

**The price will rise INFINITELY until enough sellers step forth, and rotate their shares through. This could bankrupt Citadel, and perhaps even Citadels lenders.**

 The skyrocketing demand will send the price skyrocketing. The average infinity squeeze moves [a thousand percent in a day, with options rising over 10,000 percent.](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&q=vw+infinity+squeeze&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)

Whether or not you buy, the price will skyrocket. The banks need to buy back their own position, buying the stock that they shorted, at a huge loss. It's your opportunity to make money, and laugh in the face of the rich."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165053.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['GME', 'A', 'BUY', 'ORTED', 'VW', 'GME', 'X', 'NTIRE', 'FLOAT', 'UYING', 'THE', 'OTHER', 'ITELY']|['GME', 'GME', 'X']

BOYS AND GIRLS LISTEN UP, TODAY IS A BIG DAY

Infinity War has gone global. Our retarded brothers and sisters from across the world are getting news about the war and filling our ranks

Quick update: 

*ALLIES* 

**Dr. Michael McFlurry Burry:** Actually autistic. DO NOT TOUCH HIS EARS 

**Supreme Leader General Cohen:** Loves peanuts, dogs, and hamsters. A human golden retriever. The people’s General. 

**Sir Chamath Brown Knight Palihapitiya:** Good with numbers. Math is literally in his name. Our voice. Hates parasitic billionaire hedge funds. Enjoys passively swinging his giant balls on Twitter. Our Brown Knight. 

**u/deepfuckingvalue:** Likely to become the worlds first trillionaire after Infinity War. Enjoys Seinfeld. Possibly a virgin. The original retard. 

**Lord Chen of BB:** Nimble. Very hard to understand... on purpose. Told securities commission he had no idea why his stock was going up, later that day releases PR of Baidu partnership. “OH so Sorry SEC, me no speakaaaaaa any Engrish” 

**Papa Musk:** Wields the sword of a thousand truths. Legendary short destroyer and bear meat connoisseur. Lucky numbers are 420 and 69. Actually has rockets. Our Papa. 

**r/wsb:** Actual retards. 

*AXIS OF EVIL:*

**Melvin Capital:** If Voldemort ran the Chum Bucket, you’d get Melvin Capital. A parasitic leech. Would sell their own mothers for a dime. Pure scum. 

**Andrew Left:** A tremendously gay bear. Wild, and unpredictable. Strong initial attacker, but very low HP. Folds like a house of cards once you make yourself bigger and yell loud noises

**CNBC Boomers:** The mouthpiece of the Axis of Evil. A dying platform. Extremely jealous of our tendies. It was once said: thou shalt not covet thy neighbors wife’s boyfriend, CNBC did not listen. They want everything from us—mainly our voice and presence. 

**Retail Bears:** Backstabbing unconscionable fucks. No morals, no backbone. Fucking Judas. 

**Unknown financiers:** The roots are deep in this conglomerate of evil. Final bosses might show up in the coming battles. 

**SEC:** Did not go after anyone for 2008 when the entire world almost collapsed. Now thinks GME stock price too high in their opinion. 

*BYSTANDERS:*

**Jim Cramer:** A real life Ephialtes. Looks like him too. Genuinely wants to be a Spartan, but in the end will sell our stops to Melvin Capital so they can attack our position from the rear. 

Pro tip: NO STOP LOSSES ON A VOLATILE SHORT SQUEEZE

**Retards on the sidelines:** We are witnessing one of the greatest reverse wealth transfers in history. Get in and be a part of history. 

*CASUALTIES:*

**Toilet Paper Handed Soldiers:** WHEN YOU BOUGHT GME AT $150 and it went to $80 WE TOLD YOU WE’D COME BACK FOR YOU. No retard left behind. Band of retards. Apes stronger together. I know you are wounded, but the war is not over. 

*FRONTS:*

$GME is the main battle front. There are others. But GME is THE BATTLE FRONT. 

Listen retards, we have literal whales on our side. General Cohen, Papa Musk, Sir Chamath, Dr. Michael McFlurry Burry. We have politicians on our side, AOC, Elizabeth Warren. Possibly the fucking president of the U S and A.

Ok I don't get these messages but I want to tell you what is happening to you and 
#HOW FUCKING RIGGED THIS GAME IS AGAINST US.


First - understand what a stop loss sweep is.


Here's a great article as to why you don't want to put in stop losses: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-i-stopped-using-stop-loss-orders-2013-05-09


1. You put a stop loss on your GME shares.  All brokers can now see stop loss placements in their order book.  You can't see that data, but they can.

2. Brokers take a few shares of GME and sell them for ridiculously low prices to drive down the price.  Guess where they are driving that price?  To your stop loss.

3. Brokers and shorters give up a few shares at a ridiculous price to trigger your stop loss and take your shares.  Sacrifice a few shares for more shares.

4. Usually the stock rebounds after a short attack but the artificially low price is a buying opportunity that the MMs take advantage of.

5. Today you are seeing more stop loss sweeps.  You know why?  Because retail can't buy back in.  They can drop the stock, take your stock, but you can't buy back and take back shares at a low price.

Let me say this VERY fucking clearly so the retard from the SEC in the back of the room can hear this:

#We are under a coordinated attack from both the shorters and the MM's to take our shares at low prices and not buy back in.  Futhermore, the MMs are taking our shares to benefit in the ultimate short squeeze show down with the shorters.  We are now cannon fodder in this game. Somebody should copy and paste this into the wikipedia definition of market manipulation.  You fucking hear that SEC? FINRA? 


You can avoid falling into this trap by taking off stop losses.

&#x200B;

I was in my early teens during the '08 crisis. I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.

Those close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.

To Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.

To CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/). They include, but are not limited to, **IBM**, **Cisco**, **TMobile**, **JPMorgan**, **Oracle**, and **ZipRecruiter**. Their parent company is [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal), owned by **Comcast** and **GE**.

To the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these ""millennial blog posts"": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? *We're not enemies, we're on the same side*. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.

To WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.

They are shorting because they think that WSB will make their tendies and sell on Friday. Well they are right about one thing, we’re coming for their money, and not just 30%, assholes. 

If DFV can hold, I can hold. 500 is paper hands. 1k is wood. 15k 💎 💎 💎 . But that model is based on today. When we hit 15k, 100k will be the new diamond hands.

Any short squeeze in silver paper shorts would be EPIC. We know billion banks are manipulating gold and silver to cover real inflation.

All of the best mines for silver have already been depleted in recent years. There is a severe supply shortage developing. At the same time, demand is skyrocketing. Solar panels, electric cars, electronics and many other products need more silver than ever.

Both the industrial case and monetary case, debt printing has never been more favorable for the No. 1 inflation hedge Silver.

Inflation adjusted Silver should be at $1,000 instead of 25$.

Why not squeeze $SLV to real physical price.

Think about the Gainz. If you don't care about the gains, think about the banks like JP MORGAN you'd be destroying along the way.

Tldr- Corner the market. Gold Ventures thinks its possible to squeeze $SLV, FUCK AFTER SEEING $AG AND $GME EVEN I THINK WE CAN DO IT. BUY $SLV GO ALL IN TH GAINZ WILL BE UNLIMITED. DEMAND PHYSICAL IF YOU CAN. FUCK THE BANKS.

If the brokerages close trading on $SLV or various silver miners, we can continue to squeeze the market by purchasing physical silver at online or local silver/gold dealers. It all trickles into COMEX to squeeze supply.

The process involves your new broker sending a request to RH requesting to move your portfolio over. When RH gets that request they will IMMEDIATELY freeze your account entirely.  You won’t be able to do anything through RH anymore.  


The process will normally take 3-5 business days but I’m sure with all the insanity going on it’s likely to take considerably longer.

If RH and Citadel pull this shit off, they'll have staved off a short term catastrophe and will have YEARS to save up money to pay out some nominal fees once the legal battle ends.

Thank you Matt Phillips and Taylor Lorenz for enacting the same level of distain for us as the hedge fundies our tax dollars bailed out after the Great Recession. 

You mischaracterized both the type of people involved in this action (literate, engaged, working poor to middle-class) and the action itself (is it greedy to spend our paychecks wringing dry hedge funds who daily manipulate the markets in milliseconds while we are forced to drop a few bucks here and there and hope for the best?).

There is a palpable elitism at play here, and a deeper concern that rests not with those risking real money during a pandemic for the shot at a better life but for the goddamn MMs and collective arbiters of financial advice and financial institutions beneath whose thumbs we've been placed to squirm long enough. This is a handful of stocks we're using to kneecap some idiot short sellers and you're insinuating that we're about to collapse the whole system. 

We're not. We can't. These motherfuckers can, and have. We're fighting for a piece of the damn pie.

Make up whatever story gets you the headline, ""[above the fold](https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1354635872180662273),"" as you so deliciously revel in bragging about. I hope you both learn from this. Because you didn't even bother to spend any time here listening to what these working folks have been shouting into every post on the board, shouting on Twitter, on Facebook, into our phones as we watch the stock green dick rocket every hour on Robinhood: ""THIS ISN'T ONLY ABOUT THE MONEY!""

The game of chicken models two drivers, both headed for a single-lane bridge from opposite directions. The first to swerve away yields the bridge to the other. If neither player swerves, the result is a costly deadlock in the middle of the bridge, or a potentially fatal head-on collision.

**How to win the game?**

In a game of chicken, **the one who stand their ground or show that they are willing to stand their ground no matter what, wins**. In the car example, you would r**oll down the window, take out the steering wheel, throw it out the window, and then show you hands outside the window, and press hard on gas pedal.**

**This is a game of chicken.**

In this case, there is a subtle difference. It is between two groups. 

One group: hedge funds. Another: degenerates.

Another set of dynamics is added. And that is **loyalty**.

Now, hedge funds are united by greed. wsb are by revenge and emotion, fueled by decades of anger and frustration toward wall street. The latter is a much stronger force of union, especially when dumbass hedge funds are adding fuel to fire by doing the exact thing that got them into this position in the first place: manipulation**.** 

**Their group can be easily disbanded.** All it takes is for them to see that we are holding ground and pressing the gas pedals and taking out the steering. The dynamics here is that their car is driven by a bunch of greed-driven selfish funds; it is in their nature to be selfish. When one of them decides that there is no hope of winning, it could jump out of the car to avoid death for itself ONLY; it won't care about the other guys. When that happens, the game is lost for them. And as i said, every one of them is **selfish** in nature. 

On the flip side, for people driven by rage, no one cares who jumps off the car. Everyone is focused forward.

Therefore, one way to win is to simply let their selfish nature win the game for us.

The only danger is that if rage dies off too quick before the opposite side's selfish nature take over, then the game is lost.

So, at the end of the day, if you wanna win and win big, simply keep being furious."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165053.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|[]|[]

As if we're all so dumb that we don't realize these stocks can go down just like they can go up.  Motherfu\*\*er, have you even been through this subreddit?  We know exactly what the risks are.

This is the sub where people post graphs from March showing themselves 1000X'ing on Puts and then losing it all right back.  We get it more than you do CNBC.  We know there is risk.  Stop acting like you need to hold our hands and protect us.  That's bullshit.  None of you actually care, you're just upset that retail is absolutely killing it while your shitty portfolio is selling off.

What exactly are we risking anyways?  Most people on WSB are young with maybe a few $10K's in the bank.  We are the exact people who should be taking risks.  $10K invested in the stock market even over the next 30 years isn't gonna change your life.  These guys are flying around in private jets telling you to save for retirement so that you won't get kicked out of your shitty apartment at 65 years old.

This is a moment in history where billions of dollars have flowed from the rich to the poor.  Where it'll end up, who knows, but I guarantee that we'd rather play the game and take the loss if it happens than sit on the sidelines and play it safe.  The truth is that if you want to make it in this world, you have to take big ass risks.  The downside is usually overstated.

So yeah, fuck off CNBC analysts and stop telling us you're worried we'll get hurt.  That's not your real worry.  Your worry is that we're exposing how rigged the system really is."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165055.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['CNBC', 'CNBC', 'WSB', 'K', 'I', 'CNBC']|['K']

**IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL INFO, COMMENT IT SO I CAN UPDATE THE POST, I'M CHEKCING THIS THREAD BETWEEN TICKETS AT WORK** 

**Stock trading alternatives to RobinHood:** 

>TD Ameritrade(GME back up for trading)

>~~Cash App~~

>Vanguard 

>Fidelity  (seems to be back up and running right now)

>Schwab  (tested, works, just flooded with traffic, otherwise quick setup and wire transfers)
 
>FreeTrade (Hassle free account creation, 10 minute setup time, instant transfers. Down side- $10/mo fee to use)

>Sofi

>Etoro (Has allowed GME trades again, be aware this is the 4th time I've had to change their status, they keep dropping and picking up GME) 

>US BANK *(has an investment tool, quick sign up, plus since it's already connected to your US bank account, purchasing should be instant)*

>Navy Federal- **Note** Quick to make, but bank deposits take several days. Probably not best option for current stock boogaloo, but might be good for PT2 if there is one

>Wellstrade (Doesn't seem to be down at the moment, but may have high fees and has past history of suspending stocks due to volatility) 

>Capital.com (Supposedly very quick and easy to sign up and start investing) 

**Trading apps to avoid-** 

>RobinHood >!More like Robbin' the poor!< 

>Webull (also blocked GME etc.) 

>Cash App (has hidden GME)
 
>Trading212  (Blocked buying of GME) 

>Merrill Lynch

>IBKR (has blocked GME)

>Ally Invest (formerly TradeKing)

>Etrade (Apparently blocking GME and AMC at the moment)

>Tastyworks (Blocked meme stocks)

>Stash

>M1 Finance (Appears to be blocking/has one trade window per day at 9:30am, possible this platform was just not built for rapid trading)

>Alpaca (blocked meme stocks)

**So, why should you continue to buy and hold GME?**

Big hedge funds bet heaps of money that GME 🚀 would go bankrupt and have been put against a wall. If investors (and retail investors like us retards) hold, this forces the hedge funds to cover AKA buy back stock at whatever price is available AKA a short squeeze.

Time for some learning so take your rockets and listen the fuck up space-cadets: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Now that I have your full attention - pretty much the butt pirates over at Melvin Capital **fucked up big time**. Melvin along with Citron Research (AKA Andrew ""Smoothbrain"" Left) and a few other companies shorted, expecting it to continue to lose ALL revenue. Now, the problem is, they overshorted GME by about \~140 fucking percent.

Essentially as long as investors can 💎 HOLD 💎 past the initial burst of buy-backs (which ***could*** be as soon as Friday with how many ITM options are sitting on Melvin's books). If you don't understand 'Days to Cover' I suggest doing some ACTUAL FUCKING RESEARCH but in short:

*""****Days to cover****, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.* ***Days to cover*** *is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question.""*

**Short Interest (Shares Short):** 61 - 71.2M

**Short Interest Ratio (Days To Cover):** 2.1 - 6.3

*^(\*there is some disparity here between data sources - approx. as reported 28th Jan 2021)*

As long as everyone holds their GME stocks, this demand by Melvin and Citron will continue to drive up the price, and this can go on technically till GME hits X number because they can only close their positions once people start selling. Remove your fucking sell limits if you like money.

**No selling > no shorts closing > demand for the stock increases > price goes up even higher.** There is no ceiling to this, the power is in your hands to buy and hold.

The point here is, the covering will take **DAYS** to happen. DAYS. No space cadets left behind so get your fucking helmet ready for launch.

We’ve filed some lawsuits. We’re destroying their reviews. We’re pulling our money out.

Robinhood is at fault and that is without question. But the News is avoiding talking about TDA, Merrill Lynch and Charles Schwab. They did nearly the SAME THING, but they aren't being talked about. (note: some people have not had any issues with TDA, some have - it does not appear to be a complete restriction like Robinhood) Ask yourself why this may be?

Because their direct competitors. Robinhood offers margin at a third the rate Charles Schwab does. They offer free options trading, Schwab does not. Even with all of this, Robinhood is better for the market that not having Robinhood. Charles Schwab recently acquired TDA and at the same time they have it in their best interest to change public perception of Robinhood. They WILL gain market share with this and the strings they pull on news to stay out of the picture should not be overlooked.

THIS IS MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE. WE NEED TO CATCH THE ATTENTION OF EVERONE AND LET THEM KNOW. 

**This is not just Robinhood. This is the establishment. This is Citadel bullying firms to commit these acts, knowing they have BILLIONS on the line. They don't care about the blatant fraud. They know they won't go to jail or be fined as much as they will save by committing these acts.** 

The actions of yesterday and today are just a glimpse of what they are capable of. We can't stand for this. I won't. I implore you to call your representatives. Put pressure on whoever you can. Make your voice heard. Things need to change and I know, given the last month, that we have the power to make these changes.

Most of all, we still have them. They definitely closed out a large amount of their shorts. I am sure many of us had paper hands and sold. I'm HOLDING. I know this isn't over. Short interest is still there. Option writing is still massive. Do not falter. We have been shaken. We have been divided. Our attention is being turned towards the atrocities of the system. We can keep those in mind and still hold course. Don't forget GME. I LIKE THIS STOCK

tldr; It's more than just Robinhood. Don't let them be the black sheep that get's all the attention. Believe in the cause and what you stand for. GME 1000


**EDIT: Some have mentioned TDA and Schwab are not doing this now. They were earlier in the day and were preventing options trading.

Bit of background: I've been on this sub for years (was even a mod temporarily when /u/only1parkjisung modded a bunch of people for fun long, long ago), and I've been in the hedge fund world for about a decade (I'm a sell-side analyst; won't go into more detail than that as it isn't necessary). I mention all of this because I know both how this world works and how the hedge fund world works, which gives me a unique insight into what might happen next.

I won't make any predictions on GME, BB, or other stocks, because I don't think the squeeze's biggest risk right now is there. Rather, the biggest risk comes from what we've already seen happen over at Discord with the shutdown of the server. Note that Discord has had significant investment from private equity funds including FirstMark Capital, Greenoaks Capital Partners, Index Ventures, IVP, Greylock Partners, Benchmark, Accel, General Catalyst, Ridge Ventures, Spark Capital, and Tencent Holdings. At least one of these firms has invested with Point72 Ventures, which recently helped Melvin Capital. So it's not too surprising that strings were pulled to get the Discord channel banned for ""hate speech"" (which is a very useful brush to tar anyone with, as anyone who challenges it can easily be dismissed as a nazi).

Now, this subreddit's long history of using several slurs is an opportunity for the hedge fund world to claim it is a hate subreddit and pressure Reddit to get it closed. I recommend the r-word and f-word be banned by mods for this reason; yes I know it is stupid and, well, r-worded, but best to play the game and self censor rather than give these assholes a single in to destroy this community.

What is the risk of Reddit getting orders from owners to shut us down? At the moment, I'd say pretty low, but the bigger it gets the more there is that risk. Reddit is owned by Advance Publications, which is owned by Donald Newhouse and the Newhouse family (some details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Newhouse). Fortunately, Newhouse's family office (think a private hedge fund dedicated to investing just the family's money) is pretty far removed from the hedge fund world afaik. The family office's CIO (details here: https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1g6j2tztzpb3t/A-New-CIO-for-One-of-America-s-Richest-Families) got her career started in the investment bank world and did not work for hedge funds, at least according to her Linkedin profile. So the Donaldson family has limited motive to stick their necks out and force a ban of this subreddit.

However, it remains a risk and a very serious one. I suggest the mods work together to get some legal representation going; if Palihapitiya was serious about investing in the WSB community, I'd suggest putting some money aside for this and for compliance. A kickstarter fund would not be a good idea because of the ease with which bad faith arguments of collusion could be made.

In this case it wasn't even a slight infringement, the brokers blatantly cheated millions, there is no denying it. (Except if the have some special contractual clauses that I don't know of. But even then, the question is does it infringe official regulation/legislation.)

Private companies regulating the market before the SEC does. Just let that sink in for a second.

So my advice: Create documentation of your portfolios and positions. Screenshots, better film the screen with the positions names, amount, date of record and further specifics. If you can, download your user data. In Europe this is possible. It has to classify as actual evidence.

I am not a paranoid person, but I always think of the worst case and that has served me well on several occasions in life.

There are many possibilities of further shenannigans I can think of:

* System outage and lost data
* Russian hacker attack
* ""Our data indicates you sold the stock yourself""
* Rogue employee
* etc.

I am not giving them a blueprint here, believe me, those people have already thought of every way to defraud us.

Be aware.

\#Edit 1: I am not a lawyer, but in my opinion a video of the screen or phone itself has value as evidence. Screenshots however can be made up or changed using Photoshop, which guys bragging about their portfolio did in the past.

Maybe the most important thing is to remind the brokers that we are watching things, because selling e. g. a very large position of one of the big boys here that is in the red, would, if documented, be an infringement on its own. A definitive one.

\#Edit 2: For people on Windows 10 using brokerages in a web browser. Just press <Windows Button> + G, enable record and scroll through your stuff. Maybe open a newspage to verify date and time."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165055.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['A', 'I', 'I', 'SEC', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'G']|['G']

I just realized something. Spend all day livid because of brokers stopping us from buying but it just dawned on me that they might actually have done us a FAVOR! Here's why...

Remember the gamma squeeze last week? If I understand it correctly, the reason it happened was because the stock price was above all the available call strikes ON EXPIRY DAY. Remember that part.

So this week, they added new strikes every day because the price kept going up past the strikes -- BUT THERE'S NO GAMMA SQUEEZE BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAPPEN ON EXPIRY DAY! So each day, the price would be above all strikes and they would just add new strikes for the next day.

But today, they won't because the trading price is too low to justify.

Which means.... tomorrow, if the price is over 570, there will be another gamma squeeze!!!

https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l60euz/theory_the_hold_is_working_and_the_squeeze_is/

# Wed 01-27

Fantastic trading day. 


Up 97% on the day to close out at $345 battling all through the $300s all day.


Curiously small amounts of volume all day leads me to believe this was small
amounts of short covering and paper hands selling on each bump (we'll know more
when Ortex posts data in the morning).


Yes it took a bit of a dip in the after market, but I expect greatness from our German
brothers and sisters to keep the momentum up today. The plan is the same: buy and hold. 

# *It is working*.

What's most interesting rn is the new $ amount of calls about to expire.


I had to compile a spreadsheet for this from multiple sources because my usual
source didn't have the complete data (highly sus? Are they trying to hide this
data?)

Spreadsheet:

https://imgur.com/a/zXTeR4t

This is essentially just the options chain you can look up. But, if you take
the Open Interest (how many contracts are alive), multiply that by the latest
close price * 100 and then sum all the contracts you get the total amount of $ of shares that are about to be
exercised. 

What's crazy about GME right now?

# EVERY CLIT LICKING CALL IS ITM

That is *insane*. Never seen it before.


Tuesday ended with all those options worth $800mill 


Wednesday? They jumped to $3.5 *billion* and it will continue to rise as share prices rises. Buy and hold.


Two things are gonna happen b/c of this:


-1. Mega Gamma Squeeze. MM's who weren't properly hedged before are about to be (they will have to buy shares on the market
in order to cover these calls expiring higher than their delta position). But remember, all you degens are buying and holding, so there's low af volume and prices skyrocket with every share we *force* them to buy. Read this:
https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/26/gamestops-gargantuan-gamma-squeeze/


tl;dr


> If the stock continues to rise, the market maker's delta position also
> becomes increasingly negative at a faster rate due to gamma, requiring more
> buying, which pushes the stock even higher still, and so forth. This
> phenomenon is known as a gamma squeeze and the feedback loop resembles a
> regular short squeeze.

*feedback loop* you say? 

# Sounds like tendie rocket to me if everyone holds.

-2. Many of these shares can be exercised into proper diamond hands instead of in MM's accounts that will 
loan them back out to shorts. Further squozing the squeezees. This, however requires the owner to put up another position to
exercise.


Moral of the story:


If GME holds or even goes up further Thur & Fri this gamma squeeze could very
likely be the catalyst for the big squeeze come next week.


And it will be *epic*.

Chevrolet had a product that should have never been made; highly defective, and literally explosive. The 60's Finance bros (wall street was boring back then) checked the math and realized that actually fixing the cars was more expensive than the lawsuits. So what did they do? Well they do what finance fucks do - and literally let people burn because it was more cost effective.

Fast forward 50 years and the same finance bros are doing the same calculations. What's the biggest SEC fine ever? $13B for JPMorgan back in the halcyon (that means 'good' for the smoothies) days of 2013. Shorts have taken a $70B loss as of yesterday - AND THE SQUEEZE HASN'T SQUOZE. Simple fucking math. What's the worst the SEC will do? $100B fine? (hahaha. Well maybe with Mama Warren out there) That's a fucking pittance vs the massive retail comeuppance that was coming for these bros.

THIS should be Wall Street's unsafe at any speed moment. Shorting a stock >100% is unsafe at any speed. BEING A MARKET MAKER AND A HEDGE FUND IS UNSAFE AT ANY SPEED. Brokers who are not independent is unsafe at any speed.

But the truth is - an informed population is actually what the WS elites think is unsafe at any speed. So they say that we can't be trusted. That we have to be protected from volatility. That we can't be trusted to make the right decisions with our money. 

We are pulling the curtain back and showing how naked the emperor is. And they're banking that the fine for public nudity will be cheaper than getting rammed up the ass by their own creations.

I don't care what broker you want to transfer to, but Fidelity is one I have used for penny stocks so that's why I'm transferring to there.

I'm going to include a step by step here and include pictures below for the 90% of you who can't read.

**Text Only**

Open Robinhood and click on the icon in the bottom right. Go to settings -> Account information and write down your account number for later. Make sure that the piece of paper you've written on is edible so you can destroy the evidence later.

You'll have to open a Fidelity account which will take about 15 minutes and require some of your basic information. Once you're in Fidelity go the ""Transact"" tab on the bottom right and choose ""Transfer"". Then select ""Transfer assets from another financial institution"" and click ""continue"" on the pop-up. Click ""Start a transfer"" and log in with the log in you created when you created your account. Enter ""Robinhood securities llc"" into the search bar. Enter in the account number you wrote down earlier and choose ""Individual"" for the account type assuming you're an individual investor. Or select whatever type applies. Finally click ""Yes"" and ""Next"".

EDIT: To answer a few questions. RH will charge you $75 for the transfer and it'll take about 5 days according to Fidelity. Also, do your own research on if you want to transfer and where you want to transfer and when. This is only a how-to. Make informed decisions - I'm not your mother.

>DO NOT TRANSFER YOUR ACCOUNT IF MOVING TO A NEW BROKER. **Open a new account on a different broker and fund it.** If you transfer your account, *it could be up to 15 days before you are even able to sell your transferred securities.* **RH will lock your account during the transfer**. I transferred two weeks ago and still don't have access to the cash in my account and can't transfer it out.

Open up your RH account and click the icon in the bottom right.

I am writing to you on behalf of myself, though I expect much of my thoughts will be shared by others.  Though you may never see this, I shall speak regardless for I believe that you will feel what I have to say even if you never hear my voice.  I must admit I did not vote for you in the past election, and more regrettably, I have never participated in any form of political affairs but I feel compelled to speak now.  I believe this is an unprecedented display of unity to which we are currently privileged to bear witness.  Over the course of the last few days I have seen with my own eyes and heard with my own ears the sights and sounds of a people united.  

Personally, I have already won the lottery so to speak.  As a first generation immigrant, I was lucky enough to be accepted by this country, both in principle and by the principles of the people here.  I have been fortunate to have amazing teachers, wonderful role models, and some of the best life coaches to have ever had the misfortune of coming across me as a pupil.  Yet despite all of this, I have been selfish and focused on my own financial success without much regard to others.  In another world, in another life, perhaps I would be looking at this current situation from the other side of this lens had fortune been kinder but fate been more cruel.

To my fellow Americans and all of our friends across the world, what a time it is to be alive!  It has been and will continue to be an honor to stand with you.  Even on the news outlets that parrot the case for the billionaires, I see you speaking with your own voice!  The terms left-leaning and right-leaning have lost their meaning on this one issue as we stand united.  Long days and longer nights are ahead for many and the only thing I ask from you is to simply continue living your lives, showing love and kindness as I know you already do everyday.  Take care of your own mental well-being and ensure that you do not miss the little joys of everyday life.  Around the world, people understand the language of hope and thus I speak plainly. 

Mr. President and Madam Vice President, I have every confidence in your administration and the current authorities to levy fair judgment at this critical juncture in our history.  Thank you for your consideration and all I ask for a fair contest.

Best,
Theocletian"|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165055.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']|[]

Buy up guys, it's feeding time! BUY AND HOLD. UNBREAKABLE 3310.**

I get it, it’s not the play. I’m not saying sell your GME. I’m not a bot or a spy or a wall street asshole. I’m a regular guy who’s got a couple of bucks in his bank account and plays videogames and wants a fucking house to live in like my parents had when they were young. If you don’t agree with me, just say so.

I’m also not a financial advisor, so make up your own minds you autistic fucks.

But, BUT, yesterday we did something they’ve never seen. Yesterday, we made them run out of NOK shares. That’s what that big spike was, and that’s why trading was stopped for 2h. If we keep doing that, it will be the biggest wall street wealth transfer from assholes to retards in history. Because they will keep dumping it until it’s too late.

Impossible, you say. Too many shares, you say. Well listen up. Yesterday, in ONE DAY, we traded, or caused others to trade, 1bn shares of Nokia. That is 1/5 of all the Nokia shares in the world. That’s never happened, *EVER*. Not even when Nokia was the biggest phone company in the world.

3516.16% of average trading volume.

Do you get it? They’ll keep dumping their stock, we keep buying them cheap, and then they won’t be so cheap anymore when they try to buy back in. We can move 1bn shares IN A DAY. ONE DAY. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Why do they stop trading in NYSE? Cos they ran out of shares temporarily and they don’t want “artificial” spikes in the prices. So they made us retards wait a couple of hours while some assholes called some other assholes to unload their shares into the market, and once they had enough, they started again. That’s why that spike went down right after the freeze.

But then we did it again. And they had to stop again. The price just wouldn’t go down. The assholes who’d just unloaded shares were probably back on the phone with the other assholes who’d convinced them.

Everyone is watching us. What we do, millions of normal folks do with us, and every wallstreet asshole does against us.

What did the asshole brigade do? They started shorting NOK. They will continue to do that, because they think we’re retards (they are correct).

But how come the price didn’t go down? It’s got 5bn shares, and everyone whos ever held it was dumping it. How could we ever keep up the demand when there are so many shares out there? How is this going to work?

Because the retard brigade was buying it. There’s 3m of us and counting. If we each put 600 bucks on NOK, we get 100 shares, and that’s 300m shares.

Now imagine what happens if we put 6000 on it. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. And every dip you see, you buy more. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. They'll keep dumping, we keep buying, until they realize the price isn't going down. Then they start buying, we keep holding, the market runs out of NOK. Price skyrockets.

And normies outside were following us. They can see that the stock is still LOW, lower than 2016. This means they don’t think it’s a bubble that’s going to crash on them.

So why do the normies follow us on this, and not on GME? (I’m not saying sell GME).

Because GME has never, ever been anywhere near where it is now. That scares a normal guy who’s just trying to put in some savings for his family. They think this is some Dutch tulip market shit.

Not so with NOK. Even with the spike from yesterday, NOK is still *DOWN* from 2016. Remember 2016? Remember that being a really big year for Nokia? No, me neither. And let’s not even get started on where it has been in the past. Yesterday's spike barely shows on the graph.

You know what is going to be a big year? 2021 and 2022. Why?

What else did NOK say yesterday? Well, they revealed that they have a new kind of 1 terabit data transfer networks shit, what do I know, I’m not a techie. But it IS a new kind of technology that’s going to kick 5Gs ass. And my fellow retards of the most honorable retard brigade – Do you think we’re going to need more data this year than last year?

Remember how Netflix had to downgrade its picture quality in March because the networks couldn’t handle the amount people were streaming? What do you think is going to happen with the company that solves that?

But why would NOK be the company? Well, remember the 5G war with China?

US and Europe can’t buy 5G from China, because then China has our networks. But guess who US and Europe aren’t afraid of? Fucking FINLAND. Finland, the land of NOKIA. So tiny that some people think the whole country is a conspiracy theory and doesn’t really exist. Sorry Finnish people, nobody gives a shit about you. Good thing for you, cos you get to build the 5G network on the moon and shit because nobody is scared that Finland will take over the world.

Want proof? They are literally building one on the FUCKING MOON: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/)

And we’re going to send them there. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

But hang on, why is NOK so low in the first place if it’s so great?

Answer: because Microsoft fucked them. That’s right, they sent one of their own assholes to infiltrate the NOK, leak a bunch shit to drive the share price down, and then buy the phone part of the company. These assholes wrecked the company, the Finnish economy, and every middle class shareholder who was just trying to put their kids to college. Imagine everyone who’d be fucked if someone did that to Apple now.

Worked like a charm. Firesale. Business restructuring. Lost their phones. NOK never recovered.

The asshole they sent from Microsoft? Went back to work for Microsoft, and was paid a shit ton of money for what he did. His name is Stephen Elop. Look it up.

So they have tech that nobody else has and a brand that everyone recognizes. But what don’t they have? Money. That’s why they’re building this 1tb magic network thing in tiny fucking possibly fake Finland to show everyone it works.

But if we drive the share price up, do you think that’s going to change?

So FUCK IT. I’m in for every penny, and I am HOLDING. I’ll see you in my house ON the MOON next to a NOKIA Comms tower, or I’ll see you in VALHALLA you BEAUTIFUL RETARDED MOTHERFUCKERS.

TL;DR: NOK is literally going to the moon. Go there with them. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit: I've got a lot of messages, here are my answers to the most common ones:

Remember, I'm an idiot. I don't know shit. I see cheap NOK, I like cheap NOK, I buy cheap NOK. I'm not a stockbroker or anything. All I know is it's a healthy, undervalued company with massive upside potential, new space tech etc. There is downside risk, but the risk is smaller than the potential. So if you invest 5k, you might lose 2k but you might gain 100k if we manage to move the kind of volume we did yesterday for even a few days.

Would I bet a dollar to win 100, if yesterday everyone who bet added 50% to their money? Yeah. Might lose a quarter, but could gain 100 dollars.

Do I know it's definitely going to happen? Of course not. What happened yesterday, 1bn NOK shares traded, HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE.

&#x200B;

Ultimately, I believe this approach is repeatable, and normally I wouldn't be so interested in making money, but knowing who it is at the expense of has piqued my interest a bit more than usual.

&#x200B;

This can be a scientific method to expropriate wealth from the worst kinds of rich people, and.. well, I do like that very much indeed, so I wanted to share my analysis of this success.

&#x200B;

1) Freedom of decision and debate:

The targeting of GME shorts was a collaborative effort from the /r/WSB mass line. There was not a single centralized voice of authority that identified and mandated that $GME shorts should be targeted with a squeeze. Users smarter than me identified the weakness of the short positions, and a consensus organically emerged among users as the information was processed.

&#x200B;

2) Unity of action:

If one consensus clearly emerges, all members are expected to follow the party line and not deviate from the consensus, or continue propagandizing against it. Instead, they are committed to the decision made by a supermajority of other users.

The solidarity from subreddit users has been impressive. Hundreds of posts encouraging users to not sell and to buy more has forced the shorts into an irretrievable position. They have no choice now but to lose everything, despite coordinated efforts from their partners in the brokerages. We won, not because we had a perfect strategy or decision-making organization, but because we were unified in our action. This is the most important point. We individuals have less money and thereby less market power than the hedge funds. Obviously, the only way we are stronger than the funds is if we are committed to unity of action, even if we weren't the ones who were originally wanting to target GME shorts. I wasn't involved until later in the game, but even I bought in, because I wanted to be part of something greater than myself. Of course, not every single retail investor who bought GME made money, but on the net, the hedge fund lost billions that will be divvied up among the short squeezers.

&#x200B;

3) General organization:  
This was actually the weakest point in the chain and the greatest area that can be improved. A subreddit with 300 new low-quality posts a minute is not quite the best way to arrive at a consensus. I think better voting and discussion systems may be in order to improve this.

&#x200B;

This is me trying to take advantage of the political to make money. This is not me trying to make a political post about which candidate you should support or which economic policy I want in my country. It's simply me talking about applying a method for better organizing the practice of Buying Stocks I Like.

&#x200B;

The principle of democratic centralism (which is a Leninist idea) is very applicable to organizing future short squeezes. Note that I'm not saying we should manipulate the market or try to drive prices up, I'm just saying that if We all decide we like a stock, We should buy it. And if a lot of people are shorting a stock, that can be a good reason to buy it :)"|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165055.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', '$GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'WSB', '$GME', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'A', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

They are scared. 

The shorts have only themselves to blame. They were given life lines and extra capital to escape their positions. But instead they use that money and opportunity to double down. 

They call us names and make it seem like we are bandits, when in reality we are your brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles and so on. There is nothing malicious about liking a stock and buying and holding it. 

In fact, CNBC and other outlets encouraged the young generation to start investing and tell us the stock market is the greatest creation of wealth possible. 

But when we do, they don’t like us getting it right. They are the pool sharks at the table and they just want us to play to get our money. 

Hold strong in your convictions and if you’re in a certain stock remember why and do not let emotions take over. When you do, they win and you lose. And trust me when I say, we do not get a bail out. 

Hold strong!

My mother always told me that when I would complain about arbitrary treatment. I would play by the rules and someone else would ignore them. When they would win I would appeal to the first authority for an explanation. ""Are you going to let them get away with this""? ""Life isn't fair"". No, it is not. The game is the game. Always.

In this moment, the fascade cracks further. When the first breach was made I do not know, perhaps it was Socrates, but today I see thousands. Millions. 

Once they were laughing, luxuries falling out of their disgusting diseased mouths as they cackled. The unmistakable stench of derision carried on their breath. They told anyone outside of their elite class that we were fools for even trying. They told us that we were naive. We needed networks to be successful. We needed polish. We needed expertise. We needed THEM. The game is the game. Always. 

They are no longer laughing. Their odious oeuvre still wafts through the air. While the rot, and hate, and condescention, remains, the noxious air betrays a new addition. Something all together disconcerting. What it betrays, is fear. They are afraid. And they should be. We do not need their inherited resources masked as acumen. A new day dawns. The day where we make an ever so slight step towards what they fear the most. An even field. Life becoming ever so slighty more fair.   AND. THEY. ARE. SCARED. They look at us and see roughness. We look at them and see softness. We are both correct in our estimation.

The game is the game. Always.

Fuck them in the street. Fuck them all in the street. We are the righteous. We are blessed by Phoebe. What started here will echo through time in the eons to come. Mount up and ride with the fury of a thousand rockets into the universal filament. May the wind always be at your back and the sun upon your face. And may the wings of destiny carry you aloft, to dance with the stars.

His excitement tries to cut through the field of regret the memory has sparked, but it can’t.

“Well, did you trade it? Did you have it when it went to two thousand??”

He’s so giddy it’s almost palpable. You take a sip of coffee before answering.

“Well uh, I was, but sold my shares in the morning after they fell fifty bucks in after hours trading, at two hundred.”

I have little funds, I'm not the most successful one, my risk profile is literally ADHD (diagnosis in hand), but I have my ups and my downs. Overall, I've made more money than I've lost so I consider my journey worthwhile - not just for my finances, but also for my personal education.

My WSB account only equates 15% of my net worth, 80% is in index funds and 5% in penny stocks.

I early on decided to trade primarily in US markets, simply because of 2 things: world reserve currency status and trading volume compared to other stock markets.

That being said, after today my confidence in the US markets is heavily eroded. As a Norwegian retail investor, the blatant class warfare market manipulation carried out by various broker-dealers today is in principle no different than the Communist Party of China appropriating wealth and equity from individuals and companies alike, especially foreign investors.

In China, it's the political elite that enriches themselves by outright stealing from the plebeians and commoners, dressing it up in fancy political ideology talk.

In the USA, it's the capitalist elite that enriches themselves by outright stealing from the plebeians and commoners, dressing it up in fancy economical ideology talk.

If this doesn't lead to any real repercussions for the criminal scum at the top (much like 2008), I'm not going to feel nearly as confident placing my funds into US markets in the future. While Scandinavian markets offer laughable volume by comparison, I feel much safer trusting that my funds won't be outright stolen from me.

Wonder what happens if that erosion of trust in the American financial system starts spreading to more than just one stupid YOLOer on WSB.

Your elite class is playing with fire, just my 2 cents.

I've filed complaints with SEC over this, first time ever that I've even had to contact any US regulatory agencies in my life.

I would like to propose an ideal and see if we as a community would like to get behind it. It’s about Robinhood. 

I have always been a huge proponent for Robinhood. Let’s face it, they changed the fucking game. They single handedly dismantled the belief that commissions should be attached with a fee that has been around since the beginning of the trading stocks. WSB as a community grew because of it. It allowed more idiots and retards to make the stupidest trades, some making tens of thousands and some losing tens of thousands. Some of our best moments here at WSB were because of RH(see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d80ahvRSV8E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d80ahvRSV8E)). I downloaded Robinhood two weeks before I turned 18(currently 23) in anticipation of finally being able to open and trade my own account. A year ago I got my first big boy job and most of my money went into other accounts(401k, HSA, Roth IRA) so I stopped really using RH except for when I wanted to trade risky options. RH has its place in my heart and I think you guys can feel that as well. 

But today was an absolute abomination. An absolute disgrace to the retail traders and borderline illegal. They went against everything they made us believe. They deserve nothing but to go bankrupt or see their day in court. 

What I am proposing is we BAN all Robinhood screenshots from the subreddit. Does not matter how big of a gain it is, or how juicy of loss porn it is, RH is officially beyond this subs tenets and has no place for being on the page. Like I said above, RH has a place in my heart but I am pulling my money and closing my account as quickly as I possibly can.

I merely like the stock.

First of all, fuck Robinhood and every other platform that placed holds on trading without transparency. Fuck the hedge funds who overextended themselves with naked short selling and now are trying to fuck us over for exposing their arrogance. Fuck CNBC and the media giving Wall Street a platform to slander WSB and lie to us about closing their shorts. If the SEC don't do anything and protect their billionaire buddies, fuck them too. Shoutout to every single of you diamond-handed retards, Chamath, Papa Elon, Dr. Burry, Portnoy, AOC, Rashida Tlaib, Cuban, and everyone showing us bipartisan support.

So who do we blame for the trading halt and market manipulation? Let me explain the entities involved. I will not rehash what I have already seen others post about the short plays of Melvin Capital and hedge funds.

**What is the difference between clearing services/custodians and trading platforms?**

Citadel operates two primary businesses, Citadel (alternative asset manager) and Citadel Securities (broker-dealer arm that trades equities, equity options, and interest rate swaps for retail and institutional clients).

Citadel manages [alternative investments](http://www.marketswiki.com/wiki/Alternative_investments) covering all [asset](http://www.marketswiki.com/wiki/Asset) classes, investment strategies and global regions. It expanded from [trading](http://www.marketswiki.com/wiki/Trading) and [shorting](http://www.marketswiki.com/wiki/Shorting) to nabbing fire-sale [corporate](http://www.marketswiki.com/wiki/Corporate) [assets](http://www.marketswiki.com/wiki/Asset) and lending to companies in growth markets like China.

Citadel Securities is the U.S.'s biggest equity and options market maker, responsible for one in every five stock trades in America and 40% of the retail equity volume.

Trading platforms like Robinhood are brokers, firms that act as an intermediary between an investor and a securities exchange. Because securities exchanges only accept orders from individuals or firms who are members of that exchange, individual traders and investors need the services of exchange members. Brokers provide that service and are compensated in various ways, either through commissions, fees or through being paid by the exchange itself.﻿

**What is the relationship between clearing/custody and trading platforms?**

Robinhood takes a user's stock order and sells it to a larger trading firm that executes the trade, a process known as ""payment for order flow."" Ironically, payment for order flow is a practice pioneered by [Bernard Madoff](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bernard-madoff.asp) — the same Madoff of [Ponzi scheme](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ponzischeme.asp) notoriety. In a particular payment for order flow scenario, a broker is receiving fees from a third party, at times without a client's knowledge. This naturally invites [conflicts of interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conflict-of-interest.asp) and subsequent criticism of this practice. Today, the SEC requires brokers to disclose their policies surrounding this practice, and publish reports that disclose their financial relationships with market makers, as mandated in 2005’s Regulation NMS.

Robinhood made no mention of payment for order flow rates, federal regulators said, at a time when the company was rapidly growing. While Robinhood markets its services as ""commission free,"" the SEC claims that customers in reality received inferior trade prices that ""in aggregate deprived customers of $34.1 million,"" despite any savings they received from paying zero in commissions. 

Robinhood Financial has been [fined](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321#:~:text=The%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission,available%20terms%20to%20execute%20customer) $65 million by the SEC for misleading its stock market customers about how the company makes its revenue from their trades.

**How the trading halt should've been communicated**

I focused on Robinhood and Citadel since they seem to be the most relevant companies right now and is my primary trading platform. But I will also show how this situation SHOULD HAVE been handled.

Apex Clearing Corporation is an independent [clearing](http://www.marketswiki.com/wiki/Clearing) joint-venture between [Peak6 Investments](http://www.marketswiki.com/wiki/Peak6_Investments) and [Penson](http://www.marketswiki.com/wiki/Penson) Financial Services.

Tastyworks, which uses Apex Clearing, sent this email at 11:30 ET today.

*Apex Clearing, who acts as the custodian of all tastyworks accounts, has informed us that the following symbols (AMC, GME, & KOSS) will be set to closing only order status immediately. You will only be able to submit orders to close out any open positions that you have in these symbols. New opening orders will not be accepted at this time. We will update our clients should the clearing firm lift the Closing Only status in the near future.*

While there is still a trading halt that retail clients can't do anything about, Tasty was transparent with us.

Please comment if you use other platforms and know how they have handled this/who their custodians are.

Retards who are smarter than me, is there anything trading platforms could have done if their clearing service chooses to halt trading? Could trading platforms have opposed that decision? If anyone is a lawyer/is close with a lawyer, what legal grounds do we have to hold RH, Citadel, and/or Melvin Capital responsible?

As others have already posted, 40% of Citadel's revenue is from payment for order flow from Robinhood. THIS IS COLLUSION AND MANIPULATION.

DO NOT SELL. DO NOT BE SCARED OF THE SELL LADDERS. DO NOT BE SHAKEN OUT.

Positions: 1 share GME $300, 1 GME 310/320C debit spread. AND I'M NOT FUCKING LEAVING. Except to transfer my other funds to Webull.

&#x200B;

Update 1: thread from @ justinkan on Twitter.

* Just got a tip that Citadel reloaded their shorts before they told Robinhood to stop trading [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click).  If this is true, Ken Griffin and the Robinhood founders should be in jail.  This is class warfare.
* SEC should investigate the following:  1. Did Citadel’s hedge funds (Citadel Global Equities and Citadel Wellington) hold any short positions in stocks heavily owned by Robinhood users? And did they increase them in the past few days?
* 2. Subpoena all emails and phone calls between Citadel Securities and Robinhood
* 3. Subpoena all emails and phone calls between the Wall Street banks and Robinhood (Robinhood gives its shares to Wall Street banks to lend out to hedge fund clients to short through prime brokerage).
* Did the Wall Street banks communicate with Robinhood to stop trading GME otherwise they’d cut them off from their short borrow revenues?

Note that I talk in first person as this is something I’m going to do. Everyone is free to do as they individually please and copy my trade if they’d like to.  I think it’s absurd that forces at be think this forum is manipulating by posting publicly but that’s where we are at right now. 

First things first, **I'm not doing this until the GME rise is done.** I am long GME but am going long SLV immediately after. 

**If you just want to know what to buy skip to the end**

I present 2 investment DDs in this post, the short squeeze and the fundamentals.  If you want to see what to buy

**The short squeeze:**

Buy SLV shares (or PSLV shares) and SLV call options to force physical delivery of silver to the SLV vaults.

The silver futures market has oscillated between having roughly 100-1 and 500-1 ratio of paper traded silver to physical silver, but lets call it 250-1 for now.  This means that for every  250 ounces in open interest in the futures market, only 1 actually gets delivered.  Most traders would rather settle with cash rather than take delivery of thousands of ounces of silver and have to figure out to store and transport it in the future.

The people naked shorting silver via the futures markets are a couple of large banks and making them pay dearly for their over leveraged naked shorts would be incredible.  It's not Melvin capital on the other side of this trade, its JP Morgan.  Time to get some payback for the bailouts and manipulation they've done for decades (look up silver manipulation fines that JPM has paid over the years).

The way the squeeze could occur is by forcing a much higher percentage of the futures contracts to actually deliver physical silver.  There is very little silver in the COMEX vaults or available to actually be use to deliver, and if they have to start buying en masse on the open market they will drive the price massively higher.  There is no way to magically create more physical silver in the world that is ready to be delivered.  With a stock you can eventually just issue more shares if the price rises too much, but this simply isn't the case here.  The futures market is kind of the wild west of the financial world.  Real commodities are being traded, and if you are short, you literally have to deliver thousands of ounces of silver per contract if the holder on the other side demands it.  If you remember oil going negative back in May, that was possible because futures are allowed to trade to their true value.  They aren't halted and that's what will make this so fun when the true squeeze happens.

Edit for more detail:  let’s say there’s one futures seller who gets unlucky and gets the buyer who actually wants to take delivery. He doesn’t have the silver and realizes it’s all of a sudden damn difficult to find some physical silver.  He throws up his hands and just goes long a matching number of futures contracts and will demand actual delivery on those. Problem solved because he has now matched the demanding buyer with a new seller.  The issue is that the new seller has the same issue and does the exact same thing.  This is how the cascade effect of a meltup occurs.  All the naked shorts trying to offload their position to someone who actually has some silver. My goal is to ensure that I have the silver and won’t sell to them until silver is at a far higher price due to the desperation. 

The silver market is much larger than GME in terms of notional value, but there is very little physical silver actually readily available (think about the difference between total shares and the shares in the active float for a stock), and the paper silver trading hands in the futures market is hundreds of times larger than what is available.  Thus when they are forced to actually deliver physical silver it will create a massive short squeeze where an absurd amount of silver will be sought after (to fulfill their contractually obligated delivery) with very little available to actually buy.  They are naked shorting silver and will have to cover all at once and the float as a percentage of the total silver stock globally is truly miniscule.

**The fundamentals:**

The current gold to silver ratio is 73-1.  Meaning the price of gold per ounce is 73 times the price of silver.  Naturally occurring silver is only 18.75 times as common as gold, so this ratio of 73-1 is quite high.  Until the early 20th century, silver prices were pegged at a 15-1 ratio to gold in the US because this ratio was relatively known even then.  In terms of current production, the ratio is even lower at 8-1.  Meaning the world is only producing 8 ounces of silver for each newly produced ounce of gold.

Global industry has been able to get away with producing so little new silver for so long because governments have dumped silver on the market for 80 years, but now their silver vaults are empty.  At the end of WW2 government vaults globally contained 10 billion ounces of silver, but as we moved to fiat currency and away from precious metal backed currencies, the amount held by governments has decreased to only 0.24 billion ounces as they dumped their supply into the market. But this dumping is done now as their remaining supply is basically nil.

This 0.24 billion ounces represents only  8% of the total supply of only 3 billion ounces stored as investment globally.  This means that 92% of that gold is held privately by institutions and by millions of boomer gold and silver bugs who have been sitting on meager gains for decades.  These boomers aren't going to sell no matter what because they see their silver cache as part of their doomsday prepper supplies.  It's locked away in bunkers they built 500 miles from their house. Also, with silver at $23 an ounce currently, this means all of the worlds investment grade silver only has a total market cap of $70 billion.  For comparison the investment grade gold in the world is worth roughly $6 trillion. This is because most of the silver produced each year actually gets used, as I have mentioned.  $70 billion sounds like a lot, but we don’t have to buy all that much for the price to go up a lot.  

**If the squeeze happens, it would be like 40 years worth of their gains in 4 months **

The reason that only 8 ounces of silver are produced for every 1 ounce of gold in today's world is because there aren't really any good naturally occurring silver deposits left in the world.  Silver is more common than gold in the earth's crust, but it is spread very thin.  Thus nearly every ounce of silver produces is actually a byproduct of mining for other metals such as gold or copper.  This means that even as the silver price skyrockets, it wont be easy to increase the supply of silver being produced.  Even if new mines were to be constructed, it could take years to come online.

Finally, most of this newly created silver supply each year is used for productive purposes rather than kept for investment.  It is used in electronics, solar panels, and jewelry for the most part. This demand wont go away if the silver price rises, so the short sellers will be trying to get their hands on a very small slice of newly minted silver.  The solar market is also growing quickly and political pressure to increase solar and electric vehicles could provide more industrial demand.

The other part of the story is the faster moving piece and that is the inflation and currency debasement fear portion.  The government and the fed are printing money like crazy debasing the value of the dollar, so investors look for real assets like precious metals to hide out in, driving demand for silver.  The $1.9 trillion stimulus passing in a month or two could be a good catalyst.  All this money combined with the reopening of the economy could cause some solid inflation to occur, and once inflation starts it often feeds on itself.

**What to buy:**

I will be putting **50% directly into SLV shares, and 50% into the $35 strike SLV calls expiring 4/16**.  This way the SLV purchase creates a groundswell into silver immediately that then rockets through a gamma squeeze as SLV approaches $35.  Price target of $75 for SLV by end of April if the short squeeze happens.

Edit: for the part of your purchases going into shares, some people recommend PSLV because they think SLV might start lying about having the silver in their vault. Or that the custodian will be double counting, ie claiming that the same silver belongs to multiple people (banking on the fact that people wont all try to get their silver at once).  So if you buy SLV shares and calls, that's great.  But I think it could be prudent for us to buy options in SLV (no options on PSLV) and shares in PSLV.  It all depends on how paranoid you want to be.  There is a lot of paranoia in the precious metals world. 

Alternate options:

\- buying physical silver; this also works but you pay a premium to buy and sell so its less efficient and you take fewer silver ounces off of the market because of the premium you pay

\- going long futures for February or March; if you are a rich bastard and can actually take physical delivery of 1000s of ounces of silver by all means do so.  But if you simply settle for cash you are actually part of the problem.  We need actual physical delivery, which is what SLV demands and is why SLV is the way to go unless you are going to take delivery

\- miners; I don’t recommend buying miners as part of this trade.  Miners will absolutely go up if SLV goes up, but buying them doesn't create the squeeze in the actual silver market.  Furthermore, most silver miners only derive 30-50% of their revenue from silver anyways, so eventually SLV will outperform them as it gets high enough (and each marginal SLV dollar only increases miner profits by a smaller and smaller percentage)

**Details on SLV physical settlement:**

When SLV issues shares, the custodian is forced to true up their vaults with the proportional amount of silver daily.  From the SLV prospectus:

""An investment in Shares is:  Backed by silver held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust.  The Shares are backed by the assets of the Trust. The Trustee’s arrangements with the Custodian contemplate that at the end of each business day there can be in the Trust account maintained by the Custodian no more than 1,100 ounces of silver in an unallocated form. The bulk of the Trust’s silver holdings is represented by physical silver, identified on the Custodian’s or, if applicable, sub-custodian's, books in allocated and unallocated accounts on behalf of the Trust and is held by the Custodian in London, New York and other locations that may be authorized in the future.""

Bear case:  silver does tend to sell off if the broader market plunges so it’s not immune to broad market sell off.  It’s also the most manipulated market in the world so we are facing some tough competition on the short side"|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165057.csv|StockTicker|['DD', 'SLV']|['DD']|['DD', 'SLV', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'SLV', 'I', 'SLV', 'PSLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'JP', 'JPM', 'COMEX', 'I', 'GME', 'US', 'I', 'I', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'PSLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'I', 'SLV', 'PSLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'I', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'I', 'ADHD']|['DD', 'GME', 'GME', 'JPM', 'GME', 'ADHD']

History has shown: the 2008 VolksWagen squeeze resulted in VW briefly becoming the worlds most valuable company.

And when I say most valuable: I mean MOST valuable. More valuable than Exxon Mobile. More valuable than 2008 Microsoft.

What happened to VW was exactly what is happening to GME: well over 100% of the floating stock was shorted.

Thesis: GME follows the VW example, and will briefly (probably only for minutes) be worth more than the world's most valuable corp (hint: makes i phones.)

So, for a $2.3T market cap, using 70M shares, we require a share price of: $32857,-

Toddler CNBC Anchor to Chamath: ""Wheaaa.... but there are no fundamentals!""

To which I say: fundamentals are not important here. What is important, is that more shares were sold than were available. Something will have to give. 

A contract is a contract. Deliveries become due, and as brokerages go bankrupt, this is what the price will do.

Wall Street knows this. Citadel knows this. So they are fighting with blind panic. Throwing everything they can, at it. Including the sabotage of retail investors using Robinhood. NOTE to RH users: get a real bank to execute orders for you.

So, do you need an exit point? There you have it: price target is $32,000+. Seeing how spotty the broker websites are, I advise you to exit a little before that. But then again, who am I to tell you that? I am not an adviser, nor an advisor. Do your own research.

CLEVELAND, Jan. 28, 2021 -- The securities arbitration and class action law firm of ChapmanAlbin LLC announced today that it is investigating claims on behalf of Robinhood users that were affected and suffered losses as a result of investing in Gamestop or AMC through the Robinhood brokerage platform.
“Just a month ago, the Massachusetts securities regulators filed a lawsuit against Robinhood for aggressive, dishonest marketing practices geared toward inexperienced investors,” says Philip Vujanov, an attorney at ChapmanAlbin. “Now, Robinhood appears to be up to the same old tricks, recruiting social media influencers to encourage individuals to sign up and fund a Robinhood account and beginning purchasing shares of securities such as Gamestop and AMC, with no consideration as to the suitability of the purchases. To make matters worse, Robinhood proceeded to place trading restrictions on the securities just a day later.”
ChapmanAlbin has helped investors, worldwide, recover millions of dollars in savings invested in fraudulent investment schemes or lost due to the misconduct of broker-dealers or financial advisors.

We've got so many comments and submissions that we can't possibly even read them all, let alone act on them as moderators. We wrote software to do most of the moderation for us but that software isn't allowed to read the Reddit new feed fast enough and submit responses, and the admins haven't given us special access despite asking for it.

We're suffering from success and our Discord was the first casualty. You know as well as I do that if you gather 250k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad. That room was golden and the people that run it are awesome. We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you don't get to hang out with your friends anymore. Discord did us dirty and **I am not impressed with them destroying our community** instead of stepping in with the wrench we may have needed to fix things, especially after we got over 1,000 server boosts. That is pretty unethical.

To add to this, people are co-opting our name on twitter. I won't mention their accounts, but lots of handles with ""wsb"" and ""wallstreetbets"" in them are pretending to speak for us. They're saying things that we don't agree with, driving traffic to derivative communities and shitty pixelated merch stores, and generally making it harder for us to define who we are. There's also too much political bullshit in a community that was never *ever* political. The only way I want to occupy Wall St is in a suit myself or rent-free in the mind of a blown up short.

That is why I'm throwing my support behind the Twitter handle in general. We need a way to PUBLICLY reach out to the staff of the infrastructure that is failing us so the world can see that we aren't doing anything wrong here if they don't respond. We need to be able to respond directly to a reporter that is lying to the world about our clubhouse. We can't be expected to meet any expectations when we aren't given the tools we need.

That's not to say I approve of every message or will even be in the loop for all of them, but it's clear to me we can't do nothing and we need a megaphone.

**http://twitter.com/wsbmod** aka **@wsbmod** is the only Twitter handle whose statements are directly from some part of the team.

I speak for myself here and no one else (and no one else here speaks for everyone else either).  Feel free to DM for more facts and context.

CNBC, whether its true or not, the past 3 days have made EVERYONE honestly believe that you are truly bought out by Wall Street, in every sense. You’ve paraded “analyst” after analyst, hedge fund manager after manager, boomer after boomer, to try and demonize and deflect blame for the GameStop situation.

**Firstly, your contributors need to stop pretending they don’t know short squeeze mechanics.**

You’ve had dozens of people on your air whining about how no one in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) cares about fUnDaMeNtALs and VaLuATiOn regarding GameStop. OF COURSE, we don’t care about GME’s fundamentals *anymore*, because we are in a SQUEEZE. We are in a squeeze in which the Shorts have DOUBLED-DOWN constantly. That means OF COURSE the price keeps going into the stratosphere. Do you actually believe your own lie that the Shorts like Melvin have closed out? I don’t, and we have data that agrees. Why would we sell our shares “’fair value”” if the squeeze isn’t done?

Secondly, most of us are well aware that GME isn’t a $100billion company, or whatever $5000/share is. I think we are all very much aware that we are in the middle of a short squeeze, NOT price discovery.

*This does not mean that our interest in GME was not a* ***value-based thesis*** *at first*.

Our most famous GME long u/ DeepF\*\*kingValue has been in GME since 2019.([!!!](https://t.co/TengJuA7O9?amp=1)). There are others here who I’m sure joined at some point way back when. If you want more credibility, the famous Michael Burry and some dudebro Donald Foss both entered large positions in GME a long time ago. These people believed in the **FUTURE** ***VALUE*** of GME. They saw that savage, unrelenting short sellers like Melvin had *pounded* the share price into the ground, actively and immorally aiming for bankruptcy. Retail bought in in September because Ryan Cohen saw enough **value** to buy stock. The price jumped to $13/share in November because Ryan Cohen expressed his vision for a turnaround that people saw a ton of future **value** in. The big spike happened when Cohen n co. joined the BOARD OF DIRECTORS at GME. Why are your hosts and “analysts” pretending that these things didn’t happen?

And the whole while, Melvin and Shorts were DOUBLING DOWN on their positions, which were already part of the preposterous, irresponsible and potentially illegal +100% short interest. And even now (as far as we know), the short interest IS STILL **OVER 100%**. STOP PRETENDING THAT THESE THINGS DID NOT HAPPEN. You’ve had people constantly claiming that the prices are reaching these levels “for no reason” and that the initial bullish sentiment was created “out of thin air”. The people who keep saying these things, including your hosts, are either willfully ignorant or acting in bad faith.

Good, decent people provided their Due Diligence on this subreddit. They pointed out the $6.4billion in revenue in 2019. They pointed out the E-commerce sales *tripling* YOY. They pointed out the ability to easily pay off debt. They even called HUNDREDS of GameStops, where we found out they were constantly selling out of inventory, AND have plans of having PC-building-stations in-store. They pointed out the rapidly expanding Gaming Market, and the ability to grab substantial market share. And yes, they pointed out the 140% short interest, **BUT PEOPLE DID NOT START BUYING $GME SOLELY BECAUSE OF SHORT INTEREST**. Smart or not, honest people here bought into GME initially as a **value** play. They did their homework. They found data. They showed proof of positions. This brings me to my third point:

In the entire time I have been on wallstreetbets, we have NEVER “targeted” a stock or hedge fund JUST to bust the shorts. Short-busting is not who WSB is. Those are the kids on TikTok, or the grifters on Twitter. Every single *popular* thesis on here has been backed up with [research](https://t.co/1ab5ppItOo?amp=1), [financial analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqk15o/fallen_angels_shitty_cars_worse_debt_and_what_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and quality (depending on who you ask) discussion. Just because we talk like, stupid people, doesn’t mean we don’t say smart things. And maybe our ideas DO end up backfiring (see: [$PRPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jcbj0n/final_score_on_prplw_32m_gain/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3])), and MAYBE 85% of the members don’t know what theta decay is, but we do *not* pull stocks out of thin air, as you’ve claimed.

People here genuinely believe in these stocks. People here believe in Ryan Cohen, and the potential for GameStop to be reinvented. People believe in Blackberry’s future (present) as a rock solid software company. This brings me to my final issue:

It is disingenuous and plainly incorrect to blame every. single. price increase. on the “reddit rebellion” and short squeezes. STOP saying we are going after $BBBY – there hasn’t been a substantive post in 4 months on that. STOP saying we are pumping $NOK – we’ve advocated for leap calls in NOK for MONTHS because *we know* we cannot wait out their giant share float. And for JPow’s sake, ***STOP BLAMING US FOR A***\[movie company\]***MC, EX***\[clothing store\]***PR, AND IRBT. TWO OF THOSE TICKERS ARE LITERALLY BANNED FROM THIS SUBREDDIT, AND THE OTHER ISN’T EVEN REAL TO US. WE CANT EVEN TYPE THEM INTO A POST WITHOUT GETTING AUTO-DELETED.***  People who try to pump a stock for no reason are BANNED.  Yes, because of the events of this month, and because of the actions of groups like Citron, many people are happily engaging in one particular short squeeze. But that’s it. Yes, retail is more powerful than you may know, but we are not *that* powerful.

If you or anyone else reading this are wondering why there seems to be more internet chatter on that *one* particular movie company, hear this: *SOMEONE* has been creating fake accounts and BOTS to spam and pump up \[movie company\] and $nok, etc. to distract from GME. Ask the admins. Look at Chamath’s twitter replies. Look at **ALL** OF FINANCE TWITTER. There are newly created accounts and bots spamming the hell out of these other stocks in an effort to *manipulate* the market and save the shorts. Jeez, I wonder who is behind that? **Could it be the same group of people who bought $1.2million of GME puts right before** [**tweeting something?**](https://t.co/Fz1aTbMa2p?amp=1)

If anyone in the void is reading this, thanks. The point of this post was just to fight back in a tiny way against the days and days of whining millionaires on TV berating people they literally know nothing about. It’s to point out the ignorance of self-serving boomers saying things like “the SEC needs to regulate  *the* Reddit”, etc. The point of this post was just to get our little corner of truth out there in the world, because we all know that truth is in short supply. 🚀

If not change it.

I wrote this in response to someone elsewhere who asked simply:

> So they're betting against the company? Like, they have no faith in them? Investing like this makes one feel horrible.

Yeah. There are three ways you can short.

--- 

1) You buy an option with a predetermined end date with the RIGHT to sell a stock at a certain price (depending on how much you want to pay determines the price.) If a stock is $10 and you expect it to drop to $5 in 6 months, you might buy a $9, 10 month expiry ""put"" (right to sell at price) option. This might cost you 50c per share. 

IF you're even slightly right, ie it drops to any price lower than $8.49 before expiry you made 1c per share. You can also change your mind and sell the option (either more (profit) or less (loss) than 50c/share).

IF you're properly right, and it does drop to exactly $5 you make $3.5 per share. If it rises, or drops to any number above $8.50, you lose the price of the option (50c/share). 

---

2) You're a big player. You call your buddies at Pension Fund X42 and say ""Hey can I borrow those shares you have for x% interest and return them to you later?"" A set timeframe may be set. I don't know for sure, but probably. Anyhow, Pension Fund X42 says ""ok"" because they aren't looking to sell them, so might as well make some interest on lending them. 

So you borrow them, and immediately sell them. You pay your daily interest to the pension fund, and you wait. When the price drops, and you decide that you've made enough, you buy them back and return them. You keep the difference in prices whatever that may be, minus the interest.

If you're wrong... You're still obliged to return the shares to Pension Fund X42. So at some point you have to decide to eat a loss and buy the shares back. 

---

3) You're a big player and you are ok with a bit of lawbreaking, you Naked Short Sell. This is great because it's cheaper! No interest payments! 

Here, you simply sell shares you don't have, and buy the imaginary shares you just created back later so that the number of shares on issue doesn't get too far out of whack and you don't get investigated. Any gap between your sell price and buy price is profit or loss depending on which way it goes. 

---

What's happened right now is mostly a combination of 2 and 3. I'm sure there is a bit of 1, but 1 only causes predictable losses (Like the cost of playing a hand at a casino. You only lose the amount you bet if the cards don't go your way.)

So the risk with 2 and 3 is that because you're **obliged** to buy back the shares at some point, if they go up, when you have to quit, you have to pay the current market price and your actions can make the price go up even more. 

Now you're in a short squeeze. You are obliged to buy but the price keeps going up every time you do. It's entirely possible that others see the price going up and buy, so you're now competing to buy a limited number of shares with everyone else. So the price goes higher. Your losses are potentially infinite. 

---

**What's slightly different** between this particular short squeeze and all the others is:

---

1) The dumb fucks naked short sold AT LEAST 40% more shares than ever existed. They're obliged to buy back more shares than is possible. The only way out of that self-made trap is a complicated mess of desperately buying, returning, rebuying from the people you borrowed them from, and returning them with losses at every step. Imagine if I sold you 10 cars, but only delivered 6. You're standing there with your wtf face and I say ""Hey! how much would you sell those 4 cars for?"" You can name your price at this point. I pay it. Then I ""finish"" my ""10 car delivery.""

---

2) Retail traders are acting as one single semi-coordinated hive, loosely behaving similarly to what would in prior short squeezes, be a competitor hedge fund. They own a lot of the shares the hedge funds (HFs) NEED to buy - but they're not selling. They're actively cheering for the HFs bankruptcy while watching the price of the stock they hold skyrocket. Only other HF billionaires are allowed to do that and get away with it. 

.

2a) HFs can be negotiated with. If you're really, really getting bent over and fucked, and you grovel enough, you can usually cut a deal where they stop trying to fuck you. If they won't talk to you, they'll often talk to your bank/broker/some other bigger player that can convince them that your bankruptcy will also cause significant losses or bankruptcy of another party they're not trying to fuck and they might like to have as friends one day. ""You quit this, and we'll owe you one."" It's always good to have favours to call.

.

2b) The self proclaimed retards on WSB can't be negotiated with. They don't need favours. They don't care if you go bankrupt or there's collateral damage. They don't give a fuck about any of them. For the most part they only hold a few hundred shares each max - and also for the most part, they're playing with their own money that they can actually afford to lose even if it hurts for a year or two. 

How do you negotiate with, or swat a million wasps stinging you? You can't.

---

**Edit.**

Thanks for all the awards guys! I'll soon have enough to make a Tiara and become your Яetard Prince for the day! I was actually expecting posts telling my how wrong I am. I only think I know what the fuck is going on most of the time and usually figure out later that it wasn't.

I'd like to thank the academy, and my parents who never believed in me, and Scruffy, my first dog, who, like WSB, played chicken with truck, and, and, and...

Also.

We need to compile a list of the trading bans and blockages that are happening today. People need to know what actions brokerages have taken. Please contribute in comments below. Attach screenshots if you want.

Note - Trading halts by the entire market (due to volatility) don't count. I'm talking about trading bans on specific tickers by **brokerages** when trading should have been open.

I'll try to keep updating this list as I read the comments

Use this template if you can. Please be as specific as possible. Don't spam meme stocks to get others to buy or post referral links. That's not the point of this thread.

&#x200B;

Hello everyone,

as we all know, the majority of mainstream media is now aware of our situation and they are calling us gamblers and „internet kids“ who don’t understand the market. Perhaps this is due to billionaire market manipulation, perhaps it is what they really think about us. Either way, it makes me fucking mad.

I’m well in my 30s now, worked for over 10 years and did everything they expected of me: A bachelor and master in engineering, then even an MBA after that. I started work-live at 22 and did my two masters degrees simultaneously, just so I can start growing my 401k as early as possible.

By now I make 140 000 $ a year. During all this time I industriously invested in ETFs and the like. I even bought a few cryptos here and the odd share there. Every two years I get a letter telling me that I just earned another 2 points for my pension fund and that in the future I will be eligible to receive my long awaited retirement money. Roughly 3 000 $ per month (before tax).

3 000 $? This is about 26% of my current monthly income. This is a fucking joke. And you know what drives me mad? I will have to tax it 100%. I don’t profit from all the tax cuts boomers got in the 90s and early 00s.

Do you understand what I want to tell you? Do you get it now? We can already see, that all future generations are fucked. And meanwhile we are bailing out boomers who back in the days could afford to buy a house with a stupid 9to5 where all you had to do was clock in. With a safe job that didn’t require you to be flexible and work after hours. And these people now are telling us we are gamblers and we „should just work hard“ so we can earn our property.

Now let’s talk about GME. The internet kids that are fucking over the hedge-funds and wall-street. The inexperienced, stupid traders that violate the rules of the market.

Rules? It was you! You made these rules. You told us what we are allowed to do. And now we have found a stock, that we maybe even have a little nostalgia attached to (despite their terrible trade-in offers, it was always a place where you could hang out with friends to browse and it was a cool hotspot for gamers). And then we see the numbers, see the percentage of shorts, the incredible amount and wonder: is that justified? A company, that tries to reinvent itself and payed off their debt. And we realize, that the stock was perhaps a bit underrated.

So the internet starts to discuss. Numbers are collected, DDs are produced, analysis published. And we don’t need you for that. We don’t need CNBC, WSJ or The Post. All the information is on the internet, free for everybody to find. And finally even the last retard sees and understands: Your greedy hedgefunds fucked up. Big time. You fucked up and now we can profit. 

And it makes me mad how we are getting blasted from all angles now, how they even consider halting the trade for 30 days. Where were you, when Lehman fucked us over? Where were you when the dotcom bubble burst? Where were you, when millions lost their homes over some bust in the casino full of fancy dressed suits that we call the wallstreet? Right…, I forgot. It only affected the guy from the street and not the real big players. Because them you bailed out.

And where are you now, when Corona (not only) financially fucked a majority of our generation and probably the generations to come? Where are the bailouts for students? Where is our rent bailout? 600 $? Is this a joke? Many people are lucky when they can even survive 1 month longer with that.

Fuck yourself. You don’t give us the chance for a secure retirement, you don’t give the young generations stability during the crisis. We are starting our working life with the perspective, that in the end we could very well end up in poverty and at the same time encourage normal people to make debt that they perhaps never will be able to repay.

And then you disgusting animals are mad when we buy GME after your old friends have become too greedy and we see our potential for good a good return.

But I will HOLD. I will never stop holding. And I will refuel the rocket. Because I can. And because with every single penny that I put into GME, some jerk on Wallstreet will choke and the suits start gasping."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165057.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['I', 'A', 'MBA', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'A', 'CNBC', 'WSJ', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'HOLD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME']

It's not WSB selling. Even if we were, it wouldn't make a BLIP in the share price.

DeepFuckingValue could sell right now and it wouldn't make a blip.

These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price. They are selling borrowed shares. Again. To each other. They are doubling down. They are trying to scare you into selling.

Every share they sell is borrowed. It has to be repaid. They will need to buy it back and repay it.

At this point many people, investors and regular people alike are privy to the situation with GameStop stock. But much of the coverage and high profile Twitter dialog is focusing on the GameStop side of things.

I wonder how many Melvin Capital clients are aware that they may lose their invested capital or at the least suffer subpar returns.

The mainstream and social media coverage has thus far focused on GameStop, Wallstreetbets, and the nebulous term “hedge funds”

I wonder how much pressure it would cause for Melvin Capital if their investors were aware of the situation their money was currently in.

I wonder if social media could change the current narrative and possibly alert Melvin Capital investors that their investments are on the opposite side of GameStop’s meteoric rise.

I wonder what could happen to GameStop’s share price if Melvin Capital investors were made aware of the situation and pulled their investments from the fund.

I wonder if Melvin Capital could be made an example of.

Just wondering.

[I blew my account up last week on FD's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2b0no/how_i_blew_up_my_account_today_and_lost_90000/) from 100k to 20k. GME finally brought me back to 100k today after holding for about a week, and I paper hands'ded and sold. I was just ecstatic to 'undo' the fuck-up that blew my account up. I am terrified of losing that money again, it's everything I've saved up since 2017.

I am glad the mods made this sub private earlier. ***I am seeing the true level of conviction of the REAL WSB OG's***. I am seeing that there was a lot of noise today, and that the people who have been here the longest, who have bled and fought with me through JNUG/JDST, through meme-ing AMD at $13, through TSLA squeeze, through a GLOBAL FUCKING PANDEMIC.. are still diamond handing this.

#I feel like I betrayed you guys today.

I seriously told myself after selling today that I was going to stay 100% cash until this all blew over. It's been hard to know what is really going on lately because of all the bots and astroturfing. But I have seen the level of conviction of the TRUE VETERAN AUTISTS of this sub and I am rejuvenated.

Although I can't afford to risk all of my money, ***I am not going to sit on the sidelines after the laughs, the panic, the joy, the loss, and the good times this sub has given me over the years.*** I honestly see you guys as friends, even if I don't see your faces, or know you on a personal level. And friends stick it out, through whatever bullshit life throws at them.

#TOMORROW I AM BACK IN. 5K WORTH OF SHARES, AND HOLDING UNTIL THE END. NO STOP LOSS, NO LIMIT SELL. FOR GLORY, OR FOR DEATH. I WILL STAND BY YOU BROTHERS.

#***the horn of hammerhand will sound in the deep one last time.***

The outrage, to attempt to save big money while saying its to protect us. He said we are vulnerable. He said we are too ""unsophisticated"" to understand our risks. He said that shorts at least are sophisticated. Its so stupid its laughable. As if we are simply children mashing buttons. 

We are adults, with crayons.

So Bill, please tell us how vulnerable we are tomorrow.

&#x200B;

There is more to this game folks. There are ""commercial paper factories"" who issue DEBT to distressed companies. They then SHORT the same stock they are lending money  to. WHY? Because the covenants in the commercial paper (BONDS) allow the lender to then take over the company  at DISTRESSED prices due to the capital structure.  THEY FUCK YOU IN THE DRIVE THROUGH.

&#x200B;

It is rumored ( in another thread here on this sub) that $GME rejected some of these loans/bonds with unjust covenants. They went against the system.

&#x200B;

Then you have those that are too weak to resist the greed and collude with creditors to steal the company from shareholders.

First, let’s talk about fish. What do they do before they die? They jump around; they try to escape; they make noises. If your hands are weak, you let the fish escape. Now you cannot feed your family because your hands are just made of paper.

I know you are scared, me too. Especially when we thought we lost our guidance today after trading hours and we saw the price dropped without an ability to do anything. For me, I’ve just bought some more at $350 for 16k and I was scared shitless. I’m not gonna lie.

But, you should know that THEY ARE SCARED too, even more than us. You see, Melvin is nothing but just a big fish to us. This fucking shark I gotta bring it down not only to feed my family but also yours. But before we defeat them, they will use every dirty trick to fuck us over to win back this game. You will get hurt if your hands are not made of diamond. So HOLD IT tight, like you hold your wife’s boyfriend’s dong.

# WHEN TO SELL?

When you see the price goes up 5 times, 10 times, 50 times, or even more from one day to a week. That is when the short-queeze happens. That is when you sell. If your hands are made of paper, sell your position when it’s 5x. If your hands are made of wood, sell it at 10x. And so on so forth.

DO NOT SELL IT WHEN THE SQUEEZE DOESN’T HAPPEN YET. I repeat, **DO NOT SELL IT WHEN THE SQUEEZE DOESN’T HAPPEN YET**. This is a phenomenon that happens only ONCE in your life. You don’t want to miss it.

First a bit about me, I'm young and have been trading successfully with my own money for the last 2.5 years and am now retired. Thanks Elon.

With that out of the way, the beautiful thing about this movement is it's not a movement with any one representative point of view. It's more of a public gathering where if one person has an idea and it's well thought through, it gets upvoted and awarded. It's truly democratic and decentralized.

The GME phenomenon started exactly this way, when a few people including Michael Burry (Big Short fame) noticed that it was trading ridiculously below book value. Others on here took notice and believe it or not, did thorough due diligence (I encourage you to use the ""DD filter"" and see some of this, it's pretty incredible work) with financials laid out and then wrote posts about it. When Chewy founder Ryan Cohen took on a large position and became another activist investor with a grand new vision, more people on here noticed and saw not only and undervalued asset but one with actual explosive growth potential given the gaming sector growth.

Then people here took notice of the fact that 148% of the float was sold short (still a bit hazy on how this is legal) and did what Wall St. and the mainstream media didn't do, they looked and saw the audacity and greed of a few funds who thought they could never lose, were completely over leveraged and then acted on this public info and posted about it. More people here noticed and more people acted.

This is done everyday by hedge funds behind closed doors. The only thing we did differently is we did it out in the open and without inside information.

With that said, I have to respectfully decline to go on the air and be a representative of over 2.8 million members of Wallstreetbets, which by design, is not a coordinated movement and should not have a representative. I sincerely believe this and am not trying to be a hero or ""anti-establishment.""

I really appreciate you reaching out and I want you to feel free to use any of this for your segment but please make sure to stress that this is just the view of 1 out of 2.8 million people and not necessarily the views of the subreddit. I really think Fox Business has a once in a lifetime opportunity to cover the shift of market power from private to public and to differentiate itself from the hacks at CNBC.

Godspeed and make us proud!

I was talking with a friend of mine about this, and the credit goes to him, u/Always2xDown. We all know millions of shares of GME are exposed through options contracts right now, which should provide us the ability to ""exercise to close"" those contracts anytime we want... well for American contracts that is.

If we cannot buy GME shares out right, we should still have the right to buy them through our prior negotiated terms of the options contracts we currently own. If we cannot buy our shares freely on the open market as our personal liberty and freedom should allow us to do, we can still exercise and buy our shares that way.

The number of shares covered in these contracts is obnoxiously huge, and I'm not talking about the shares that need to be bought for just this Friday, I'm talking about the number of shares across the options chain. It would likely require the purchase of 100s of millions of GME shares that end up in our pockets, and in theory the shorts would still be short.

Someone with at least one functioning brain tell let me know why this won't work. My half of a brain cell cannot fully comprehend this. If we like this stock, and want our shares, why can't we exercise to get them?

&#x200B;

Edit: The main feedback is lack of capital to buy the shares. My counter argument is a lot of us bought long dated contracts when GME was still trading at $15, so surely some of us can exercise our $30c and under contracts - no?"|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165059.csv|StockTicker|['ITM', 'GME', 'GME', 'FUCK', 'THEM', 'I', 'LIKE', 'THIS', 'STOCK']|['GME', 'GME']|['I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Silver is setting up to be the biggest short squeeze of the year. Even bigger than GME. Banks have been suppressing the price by selling shorts for years and have made billions doing it. JPM was fined $900 million for market manipulation of silver but have since gone long silver, realizing they can no longer hold down the price. Now other banks are stuck holding massive short positions and have no way of getting out. The inflation adjusted all time high of silver is around $700. That's a 28x increase from where we are now. This will be the trade of the year. Silver surfers rise up!

THE PRICE ACTION IS STILL OVERWHELMINGLY IN AN UPWARD TRAJECTORY. All they have managed to do is flatten out the squeeze, however until every one of those shorts closes out their position, they still continue to be guaranteed buyers. They are desperately clawing for an out and they will take it ASAP.

bUt WHAt about THe fUNdAmeNTALs???

Only the dumbest motherfucker who should never touch a trading terminal would ever utter such moronic nonsense in the middle of a short squeeze. We all know perfectly well by very definition that a short squeeze acts in complete defiance of any fundamental analysis of a company. These dumb fucks who got caught with their hands in the cookie jar are now trying to tell us that the cookies were never even there in the first place. DO NOT FUCKING SELL!! THE SHORT BILLIONAIRES ARE STILL BEING SQUEEZED WELL ABOVE THEIR COST BASIS.

Take screenshots of everything, gather evidence for this collusion and market manipulation in a direct fuck you to the every day people the likes of which we've never seen. If there is any justice in the world, those assholes who think themselves oligarchs will see every transaction, email, and correspondence theyve had in the past several months laid bare to public eyes. Until then, THIS IS NOT OVER, WE HOLD ON IN HELMS DEEP!!!

EDIT:

And let me make something perfectly clear. I am not a financial advisor. Here is what skin I have in the game for the sake of transparency. I am up on GME and down on AMC at essentially a breakeven. I could easily sell now and be completely unscathed. I'm not fucking doing that. Do you know why? Because my risk tolerance on the few thousand dollars I threw at this thing is literally higher than If I were in vegas. I would literally rather see all of that money disappear than pull it out now. I'm either sailing this ship into valhalla or going down with it.

Do you know what the risk tolerance is for Melvin Capital, Citron, Citadel, etc is? Extremely low. Those fucking morons stand lose money for a bunch of billionaires and millionaires, lose their entire elevated status that they've enjoyed for years, lose their rights to trade with the privileges that they enjoy; and yet with that very clear motivation that they should have sensible risk tolerance, they leveraged themselves 10:1 into a short borrowing a stock into 140% of the float. Those morons are on the low ground in this duel, not us. WE ARE NOT FUCKING SELLING AND THEY ARE OBLIGATED TO BUY.

**Okay Autists. I know this is long, with a lot of numbers and concepts, but bear with me. This is good stuff.**

When I was watching the trading today on GME, I noticed something strange regarding the price action and the volume. If you noticed overall today, GME traded around 94 Million shares total. Yesterday total shares were 178 Million. Day before that 177 Million. Day before that, 197 Million. The day before that, 93 Million. Ever since we started ripping up in price, the volume has been around 200 million shares per day. But today, when the price was so high, and with so much volatility (change in price), the total volume was only 94 Million!!! If you look at the one minute chart, by the end of the day average volume per minute was 98 K / minute. And during these crazy downward dips throughout the day, the volume was sometimes as low as 8K. 8k out of 50 million float = 0.016%. That means 0.016% of the total shares changed the price so much!! This doesn’t make sense. Yesterday’s average volume/ minute was 500K per minute. Which makes sense for the crazy price movement we had yesterday.

**I think the reason why we had crazy lows and highs today was because of short selling.**

Short selling from day traders who want to make quick profits in the day and get out by the end. Once we hit $385/ share (premarket high – day trading short sellers like to use premarket high as a good short starting point because they know a lot of long day traders and paperhanded autists will sell at that point), the short selling day traders came in and started shorting hard to make their quick profits. That’s why you see the borrowed shares on iborrowdesk.com low around these times. And you have been seeing it fluctuate throughout the last few days. So I think these day trading short sellers were pushing the stock down the whole time, and when the end of the day approached, they covered their position, and we went back up to 344 close, and 373 (close to premarket high where we dropped during the day) during the first minute of after hours.

**Why is this good?**

Because that shows us these massive dips in the day are not because large amounts of autists and every day people are selling, but because the day trader shorts are synthetically pushing the price down. That means we’ve been diamond handing. And even better, the normies are all diamond handing too. Guys, this is on the verge of the squeeze! Don’t sell and let this shit ride. I believe if we can push past 385 tomorrow, this shit will rip, as no short selling day trader will want to risk getting squeezed. And the crazy enough ones that do will trigger moderate length shorters to cover. Which will have the stock break out higher. Causing the breakout and momentum traders to come join us for the fight. Shit’s gonna rip. One hedge fund gets liquidated… more covering… another hedge fund. 

**Domino effect guys. Game over.**

Some of you may argue that TDameritrade and other brokers prevented trading GME, so that’s why the volume was low. But check this out, AMC was on that TDameritrade block list too! And they traded 1.19 Billion shares today. That’s billion with a B. With the average share per minute 2 million/ minute. And we only traded 197 Million. This is not normal. Not normal for a stock that’s breaking headlines.

If I wouldn't close them at todays market open, they'd do it, and they'd do it for all customers with GME options expiring this friday. I could open a position expiring next week if I wanted to.

&#x200B;

Their reasoning was that I didn't have enough cash to exercise the calls and they don't know if trading of GME will be halted for some time in the next few days. Therefore my calls would get exercised with my balance in the negative.

&#x200B;

Now, I'm fine with closing the position and rolling it out to next week and a higher strike, since I also have a ton of shares. But this still sounds fishy to me, like they wanted to minimize the amount of shares they'd have to buy to hedge for another gamma squeeze. They told me I ""also had other positions that were heavily covered in the media, but those were fine, GME realls is a big exception right now""

ORTEX showed a 6mil decrease in estimated SI from 72mil on 26th Jan to 66 mil on 27th Jan.

Thx to that guy who said that we can bypass paywall with incognito.

This gave us over 100% (150 per share) in gains. (Using after hours close to be conversative)

To hit 1k, assuming linear increase of share price to decrease in short interest, we only need 30mil shares to be covered, less than half of the current estimated short interest.

If we go by percentage increase, we barely need 15mil shares covered to blow past 1k (230% increase)

Here's the kicker, this shit isn't linear.

On the side of the prolapsed buttholes, panic increases as the price increases, even if the shorts try to diamond hand, they will get margin called.

On the side of us rocket bois, paper hands get shaken off and only the true diamond hands will remain, representing increased reluctance to part with shares.

In brief, the original demand supply problem now has increasing demand and decreasing supply.

Political

You hear the big fucks coming in talking about SEC investigation, stopping GME from trading and what not.

We already have DD on why there is nothing illegal happening here but I present the human angle.

Before anything, politicians need our vote. It is our vote that allows them to be in power to pull off whatever corrupt fuck.

The optics are already looking like the oppressed little guy fighting back against the big fuck face. The People against Evil Melvin.

Tendies don't have a party. This sub doesn't have a party. Right now we don't care who the autist next to us votes for, all we know is GME gang gang will tear 🌈🐻 a new one and we'll be rich and celebrate together from doing so.

Other than a few dumb idiots, no politician worth their salt would publicly do anything to stop GME. The backlash from the public would be MASSIVE.

We are in the right here. Melvin and co. can whine about it but any intervention on GME will be seen as foul play. Good luck getting a single vote out of any GME holder if they try fucking with us.

PT calculation for GME

All 3 are from premarket from a 3 minute candle setup. Times for each candle are 9:15, 9:18, 9:27. Why these candles? They are completely green with no wicks.

9:15 Low 248 High 268 Volume 336k Price Range is 20$ 1$ per 16.8k Volume

9:18 Low 267.77 High 327 Volume 948k Price Range is 60$ 1$ per 15.8k Volume

9:27 Low 324 High 354.8 Volume 564k Price Range is 30$ 1$ per 18.8k Volume

My reasons for using these candles is because there was no resistance on em when I was watching, they just went up indicating institutional buying. Assuming I am correct we have 1$ move per average 17.13k Volume. We have ~70M shares shorted on GME, which accounts to ~4k$ price move. We are currently trading at 330$. If they outright cover all the shares, which they won't we will arrive at a PT of 4.3k$ for 0 Short Interest on GME. This PT also doesn't include the gamma squeezes from MM, and the bullish buying from investors. So I would say the most conservative PT for GME would be the most unlikely scenario which is 4.3k$ if the shorts just cover the entire SI. Otherwise this can keep going higher for completely different reasons as I mentioned.

I decided to buy 100 OTM (Feb 05 570 strike) calls and put in a market order for them before market opened. I estimated the price to be around $100 at most. It ended up filling for just a bit over at 110. That part was fine. But instead of buying 100 calls, I bought 100 contracts. 10,000 calls. I don't think even I'm retarded enough to forget 1 call contract = 100 calls. I'm thinking it was some kind of glitch in their system. Of course I only slept 6 hours last night, so my brain could possibly have crashed.

For some reason, the order went through and I was down nearly a million in cash. I rushed to sell, but my broker's (Royal Bank of Canada) was down. By the time it was back up, GME had crashed. RBC liquidated all my calls for far below what my buy order filled at and destroyed my account. Then, as we all know, GME rebounded. If they didn't touch any of my positions I would have been fine. Taken a big loss maybe but not negative $300k in cash. The interest charged for negative balances is 21% annually. That's $172 a day. No way I'd be able to pay that down with a job.

Many of you probably won big with GME. I didn't. I'm one of the losers. Screwed by a combination of my own stupidity and the big banks. I tried calling them, they said they would send the details of my case to ""upper management"" and call be back. I'm not hopeful. What the hell do I do now?

SEC statement yesterday matches - near perfect - to all brokerages disallowing the purchase of select stocks (GME included).

Why would all brokerages come together, especially WeBull this morning after throwing shade at Robinhood, and stop GME trading? Simple, they were forced to.

WE WERE RIGHT. The MOASS was about to happen, and it was about to crash the entire financial system.  Congrats, r*tards.

GME only fell to 112. Remember when we were fighting to beat 115 this Friday due to expiring options? Hedge funds were not bailed out. They simply were forced to put a cap on it. Hence the price spike.

Keep holding, now it's a level playing field. 

Once we're allowed to buy back in, this thing WILL spike, driven by pissed off retail traders and the recent discount of GME.

Okay GME gang. We’ve got the shorts on the ropes. They’re bleeding hard and all the billionaire suits are shitting themselves out of fear. They’ve tried false information, getting on CNBC and screaming for regulation of our “market manipulation,” trying to get us shut down, Biden administration tweet, saying shorts have already covered, etc. None of it has worked so far and they’re still bleeding money.

Now they’re truly desperate. What’s something they haven’t tried quite yet but very well could be setting up to do?

MARKET CRASH

Yes, that’s right. I believe with what I’m currently seeing, they are going to crash the market and blame it on us. Do I think you need to be concerned about GME? No, because holding it should still work and they still have to cover anyway, but this is definitely to try to get you scared and sell GME and so they can take your money back when you reinvest elsewhere.

I don’t think I have to tell many of you that the current levels are at/above where the market was valued in 2008 before the crash according to the Buffet indicator. All this says is that we’re probably in a market bubble, and it’s been at these levels for months now. But guess what just started getting talked about by all the suits? That’s right. A bubble. And who are they blaming? Us.

Now that I have your attention, let’s look at a few other things.

[This is the Volatility Index the past week.](https://imgur.com/gallery/C9ETmMR) Notice how it’s been steadily rising and suddenly spiked today? 40 is typically the resistance before the market makes a downturn. If this thing gets above that we’ll probably be seeing the market dropping quickly.

Additionally, there the spurts of high volume absolutely dumping stocks for short amounts of time. That’s one of the first things I noticed before the March crash and I’ve been seeing it get more and more abundant the last few weeks and picking up a lot today. [Notice the large red volume candles on the weekly SPY chart.](https://imgur.com/a/w0y33Lq) (Robinhood screenshot on a DD post??? Yes, I know. I’m on my phone with limited time. Deal with it lol.)

Now you might say, “it’s earnings season and there have been some bad earnings so far and that’s expected in this tough time.” Well yes, but there’s the Apple earnings today. They beat earnings pretty nicely and what did the stock do? [You guessed it (I hope).](https://imgur.com/a/Txc7po6)

Currently we’re seeing fundamentally strong companies as well as the S&P 500 beginning to drop and the volatility increase market wide. You could say this is “smart money” pulling out because they see the overvalued stocks. However, there were many worldwide financial issues sparking before the March crash. It just needed a catalyst, AKA global pandemic. Now we’re in a similar boat. Market issues in need of a catalyst.

What is that catalyst this time around? That’s right. A bunch of “millennials on a message board who have no place in stocks creating a market bubble.” Basically this isn’t smart money pulling out here. It’s MAD MONEY (hi Cramer). They are declaring WAR. They are pissed that we are “stealing” their billions on billions of dollars from them and they will do whatever it takes to get you to sell and take your money away from you again, including wrecking the market and the economy once again. The suits are out for blood now.

Do I think this will effect GME much? Only if you don’t sell. All this is scare tactics and ways to win your money back if keeping GME suppressed fails even more than it already has. There are hardly any shares to short if any at all and retail investors and autists are likely the ones holding most of the shares that could be sold.

Be careful out there autists

TLDR: GME TO VALHALLA. Rest of the market, potentially to the depths of Avernus soon.

[Stonks App Logo](https://preview.redd.it/vbp7o4ml83e61.png?width=1923&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb723f2dbc6385de8f3f2eb433596107ef91156c)

Over the past few days, we have seen that no one is on the retail investor's side. News anchors shit on us and exchanges are against us. They restrict our buying power, ability to trade and access to our portfolios. I know this seems far fetched but we need to do something to protect us and the retail traders. 

There are over 3 million of us and while we have a bad rep we actually have something that the hedge funds don't have. A huge talent and skilled resources. Within these 3mil members, we have lawyers, financial experts, professionals, and IT specialists. Here is why this is great and why I have this stupid idea. But it could work. 

&#x200B;

I think we should create our own exchange app. Why? We know who we are against and how we can get the retail traders to join our app. We will get massive attention and users within the first few days. Think of this as our own Robinhood but with high chances of immediate success. We are a community and we have the user base already. We can set new download and user base records. Now that we also have media attention this is free advertising all day every day.

&#x200B;

What should we do? Well, I have a grand idea explained below. But I guess what we would need is a couple of talented UI and programming enthusiasts/experts who are in for the cause. Perhaps a couple of in-house lawyers and advisors when it would come to launch it. You see the reward for such contribution would be a part of the entity - made by us and owned by us. 

&#x200B;

So here are the features. 

[https://imgur.com/a/e8mQng3](https://imgur.com/a/e8mQng3)

Logo: As you can see here the logo is quite obvious and the name... well it's self-explanatory. This is the ultimate way to win the new generation of millennials and gen z investors. No one wants to invest on a platform that knows nothing about the meme culture. And every millennial and gen Z degenerate loves a good meme. So hence I present to you Stonk App. 

&#x200B;

Slogan: For retail bros by retail bros (made by r/wallstreetbets.) -  This is our culture and legacy.

&#x200B;

Design: A mix of WSB, Robinhood and Yahoo finance. The tongue in cheek memes mixed with easy to use interface yet informative information and stats. 

As you can see you could share your gains or losses as well as track the new headlines. 

&#x200B;

Meme features:

* Profits are shown in native currency and in the equivalent of chicken tendies.
* Special hashtag based on the position sold/closed
* Rocket emoji (obviously)
* Nerdspace - for those who live on stats
* Free share with your wife's bf
* Crayon charts for those who love Crayola
* Roasting loss porn trades.
* Gains leaderboard
* Trending page
* Stonks man visited your investment center. = dropped a free stonk for you.
* Uncle Sam's Report - tax man report for you to track your taxes. Don't let the government fine you
* Copy trades and become the next u/deepfuckingvalue

&#x200B;

**Terminology:** 

* Investors Center = Portfolio (reference from Wolf of Wall St. pink sheet center)
* Investors Shed = buy stocks
* Traders Office = Options trading
* Boomers paradise = ETF and Bonds (probs the least used feature)
* Double Down = reinvest again after taking profits (ultimate regret for pulling out)

&#x200B;

Would you love our own trading app that doesn't intentionally shut down servers and access to all traders? An app that is controlled by community for the purpose of community?

Now it's time to do the Bernie meme. I am once again asking for your support. Is anyone interested on working for this? If so please message me or comment below. If you have resources or want to help let me know. Share this with those who are on our side. Tweet and get help. We can make this with enough community help. Let Chamath, Mark Cuban, Dave Portnoy, and Elon know. Only we can protect ourselves from these corrupt hedge funds and exchanges. 

And remember. If we go big with this, we will take the whole retail tendie town with us. If this project wins - you win and part of the profits go towards people in need. Yes, those who suffer, those who come from the poor, and those who need to save their loved ones. No more corporate running exchanges. No more multi-billion houses for the rich. It's time for the people to show their power. It's time to bring out our own tools and money to put an end to this. So what do you say? Should we make Stonks App and put it to the fucking moon?"|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165100.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'A', 'IT', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'UI', 'Z', 'I', 'A', 'WSB', 'ETF', 'I']|['IT', 'Z']

[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortexceed50.asp#:\~:text=A%20Company's%20Float%20and%20Short,to%20as%20the%20short%20interest](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortexceed50.asp#:~:text=A%20Company's%20Float%20and%20Short,to%20as%20the%20short%20interest).

&#x200B;

Here's a couple key takeaways:

* Theoretically, the maximum amount of a company's float that could be shorted is equal to the float itself; although, in reality, it's rare for a stock to have a short interest greater than 50%.
* Short selling is an [advanced trading strategy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trading-strategy.asp) used by investors to speculate on an expected price decline of a stock or other [security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp).

Note that the fundamental here is that it shouldnt be above 50%💸💸💸 normally, let alone 100%. It shouldnt even be an idea under normal circumstances. We didnt create this non-fundamental scenario. They did.

Also note that shorting is called ""SPECULATION."" Speculation is not wise, well informed investing😒😒. They are betting and they always warn that it is betting. They warn non-stop that you should be very careful. They scare you away from these massive profit potentials and hide behind complex ideas.

Once they start losing, they suddenly change their tune 🎶🎶. They claim we arent paying attention to fundamentals. That we are inexperienced and making dumb moves. This is the most shrewd, clever, intelligent market move made since the Big Short. The institutional investors got caught with their pants down 😘 in public and blame us for calling them out on it.

Market Makers are not the Market. They might think they are, but they aren't. You cant time the market, but you can damn well time shorts 😂😂😂.

GME & AMC to the next galaxy   🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  just to prove a point

TLDR: 250% float aint fundamental. But our gainz will be eternal🚀 🐱‍🏍🚀

One argument that will be made is that it's not fair that we made so much money by recognizing that a group of hedge funds and institutions were in over their heads. It hurts the market and we should feel bad for exploiting them.

The total market cap of $GME is around $12B as I'm writing this. **The total market cap of Wall Street is around $50T.** That means we've currently displaced about .025% of the total value of the US stock market. I will type that out to reiterate: we (retail traders) have displaced approximately one quarter of one tenth of one percent of the total market cap. To claim that we are doing anything which is tremendously harmful to the whole market is absolutely pants-on-fire lies. Is this going to change some elements of the market moving into the future? Almost certainly. But even if this stock goes to $1000 per share, we are still only talking about less than one tenth of one percent of the total market cap that's out there. 

If you're looking at your RH balance right now  and thinking ""wow, that's a lot of money, am I doing something wrong? Illegal, even?"" the answer is **ABSOLUTELY NOT.** What you are beginning to notice is that the wealth gap in this country is absolutely massive. Thousands upon thousands of people could make year changing or life changing money out of this squeeze and it'll hardly be a blip on Wall Street's radar. Greed is absolutely out of control at the top and this funny little news story is tangible proof of that. Do not let them gaslight you into thinking that it's wrong for you to get a slightly larger sliver of the pie. 

Good luck to everyone playing this. I've got 100 shares at a cost basis of $103.95. I might not make millions, but I might be able to make a dent in my student loans, or pay off my car, or something that makes me just a little more hopeful that I'll be able to live some sort of ""American Dream"" before I'm old and wrinkled.

edit: and in the event that you're literally brand new to trading (we're getting a lot of new people here), I would highly encourage you to read up on investment basics (there are literally millions of resources on this) and do some research into $GME and why it's moving the way it is. I would not recommend taking a position on any stock if you can't articulate your own reason as to why you're invested in it."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165100.csv|StockTicker|['$GME']|['GME']|['$GME', '$GME', 'B', 'T', 'US', 'I', 'RH', 'I', 'UTELY', 'NOT', 'I', 'I', 'I', '$GME', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'B', 'T', 'RH', 'GME']

Actually, I know it's outdated because people were saying the same thing a week ago and $GME has risen like 300% since then. There's been a huge amount of price action, and yet the shorts everyone has been talking about have exited their positions and there's still tons of short interest. What gives? Why haven't the shorts learned their lesson? Are they just stupid? Maybe. But maybe not... Let's consider the short's view on this situation:

**The $GME Short Thesis as of 1/27:** Here's the scene. A stock which is widely regarded as colossally overvalued has doubled in value several times within a matter of weeks. You know that the retail investor plan is to force shorts into a squeeze scenario. However, volume is up to unprecedented levels as new traders flood into the market to get in on the action, so the days to cover is falling, making it easier for shorts to get out quickly when they get a window. Meanwhile, older long retail investors (aka bought like a day ago) are staring at what are, to them, very nice gains. It's been several days of insane price action already, and people are predicting the end is near because, well, it must be, right? The uncertainty and perceived risk of losing unrealized profits are very high.

You look at this and predict the following: **retail investors who have made tidy profits will sell upon a volatility move, causing a chain reaction of sell-offs**. In other words, you expect that the bubble is gonna pop upon sharp price action (could be either way) and then there's going to be a sharp decline as retail investors scramble to take whatever profits they can before the next guy sells at a higher price. 

So what do you do as a short with that thesis? Short the stock, of course! **Even if there's tremendous upwards price action the next day, you can just sell short again, pay off the old loan with the new short money, and now you're in an even better position.** Your best bet as a short is to short the stock the moment before the bubble pops. High interest rates from your lender don't bother you because, based on the thesis, you're only holding your loan for a few days and the share price on the other side is going to be way below where you shorted. This is why short interest is still strong - it's generally a good play to short a bubble that you expect to pop soon.

**How the Short Thesis could fall apart:** So, the whole short thesis is based upon the idea that retail investors are going to close out their $GME positions very abruptly as soon as they see some nice gains and sense that ""the end is near."" But here's the thing: what if they don't? As an investor in $GME myself, I did the following with my gains - I sold a portion of them to cover my initial cost basis and now I'm just sitting on the rest as ""house money."" I'm not buying in anymore because I'm managing risk, but I'm not pulling out because I think there's more juice to squeeze and I've got a lot of cushioning below if the price does start dropping. If this strategy is broadly applied by other retail investors (and it's a pretty classic and intuitive investing/gambling strategy), volume will slow down and the price will generally plateau. 

So as a short, aren't you happy that the price stopped rising? HELL NO. You need that price to either fall so you can close at a profit or rise sharply so you can roll your position up. $GME remaining tremendously overvalued at a steady price for a long time would be horrible for you as a short. You've taken out a huge loan, you're paying huge interest, and there seems to be no end in sight. This is how shorts playing volatility are forced to close at big losses - when the interest over time eats up all of their potential profits before volatility strikes. I think this is the scenario in which we'd see a true MOASS.

**Disclaimer: I am just a guy on the internet. I don't have specialized education in the market, but I think this is a pretty plausible thesis for the continued short interest and how the MOASS might develop. I could be totally wrong! Let me know what you think about it in the comments**

After we're done mailing boxes labeled ""extra Jimmy shares"" full of peanut brittle snakes to Melvin's Syndicate of Stupidity HQ, I propose we buy out the contract of the wax-headed Seinfeld character on CNBC. We simply shave off 2% of our collective gains, make our offer to CNBC, and collect our Cramery spoils. 


From then on, we make him the WSB mascot. Dress him as a clown and rent him out for children's burthday parties. Make him wear a sandwich board reading ""beanie babies are crash-proof"" and have him stand outside the NYSE every day until he straight up expires from old age. Legally change his name to Jimmy ToMoon? By all means.


Me? I just wanna dress him in little sweaters and take him on walks. 


I want ideas on my desk by 4.


EDIT: Cramer, if you're reading this, if you *can* read this, what's your sweater size? I'm planning on buying 2 sizes smaller, so act accordingly."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165100.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['GME', 'THE', 'PLAN', 'HQ', 'I', 'CNBC', 'CNBC', 'WSB', 'NYSE', 'I', 'I']|['GME']

Back when penny stocks weren't against the rules, the days of delisted tickers like OMVS and the others. I know a lot of you (about 2 million in the past couple of days) are new here, but I just wanted to say this has been one hell of a journey over the years with you guys.

I joined WSB back when I was still in highschool. I feel like I've grown up with you guys. I still remember losing $2000 on my 21st birthday when one of these biopharm companies we were all playing released their trial phase results. That was a lot of money to me then, still is to be honest, but I'll be damned if I didn't have a hell of a time and learn a lot of valuable information in losing that couple thousand dollars. I still remember how happy I was when i logged in one day to see i had finally earned a flair in my favorite subreddit as well.

It's 5 am here and I'm kind of cooked right now off the sauce, so I'm probably rambling at this point, but I just wanted you to know that I love you all and you're all some very unique people. Being here in this sub is proof enough of that to me. I hope you are all blessed with as many tendies as you can eat. And remember, whatever happens, it's never aloha, we'll always see each other once again boys and girls.

In 2015 FINRA fined Morgan Stanley $2M for under reporting their short interest. 

Let’s say that again - fined $2m 

If a fund is a few billion dollars deep in a short - their underreporting of short interest is way more fucking beneficial than paying $2m

This system is fucking rigged and needs to be taken down. 

The regulators are basically saying, “You can destroy companies and fuck over retail all you want. But you gotta pay $2M first.”

Yes, we can all go ahead and post ridiculous memes and share ridiculous amounts of loss (or gain) porn. This is after all, just a place to have fun and share stories. 

But we can never forget what has happened this week. After a year of making billions of dollars due to market inefficiencies and volatility during a national pandemic, brokerages and hedge funds came together to screw over retail investors. By blatantly prohibiting their users from searching or buying stocks while continuing to allow sell orders to process, brokerages like Robinhood have proven that we were never ultimately the customer, only the product. 

We cannot forget that powerful institutions across tech, the media, and finance have come together overnight to blatantly screw over retail customers. It’s a big club and we ain’t in it. 

There are 4.7million people on this subreddit FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION. The majority of them are Americans in a country where national elections can be decided by 500 votes. I don’t want your memes. I don’t want your stock picks. I want every single person in here to think about today the next time they fill out a ballot. 

If today every single person on this subreddit gave $1 we could form a SuperPAC that would be able to get a meeting with any member of congress TOMORROW. Hell we could spend it all on a billboard outside the SEC asking them to do their job and investigate Melvin Capitol. 

At the end of day, the media will always see this subreddit as a rude aberration on an otherwise perfect financial market made up of wealthy astute professionals. Until we start making over voice heard outside of a subreddit we will be continued to be mocked, ridiculed, and ignored.

Some of these companies like GME, AMC are good companies that's been hit hard by this pandemic. Hedgefunds and Wallstreet just want to short these companies to zero and make millions. 

 I really think right now we have enough support and enough of us to change that direction in history. Wallstreet says  well weak companies need to just go. 10 yrs down the road though I want to be able to watch a movie in a movie theater with my family. If we all buy and hold in what we believe in it gives these companies a second chance and we as a group can stop these companies from being shorted to death and just disappear.

We are taking on the big money who has  screwed us average Joes so many time already. This is why the GME is so  important! We are on our way to give more power to the people!!

SO, now what to do? What I will say next is SUPER IMPORTANT for everyone who joined in the last days!!

**We are now playing a mindgame against the big money.**  As we have seen in the past days we are hitting the right spot because  the big hedgefunds are fighting back in every (dirty) way possible. This  shows us we are right. NOW: **They  have ridiculous amounts of money to stretch this play and induce fear  because everybody is waiting for the shortsqueeze to take place.**

THAT'S why HOLDING ON TO YOUR SHARES IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING EVER (or buy more if you can safely afford it)!

The  ride will continue to be bumpy and we have seen ridiculous swings in  the past (+- 30%). Now don't be feared, we are getting there but only if  we don't lose the prisoners dilemma (google this). Now go back and  search this reddit for the incredible due diligence (DD) that has been  done or go watch what Roaring Kitty (aka [/u/deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue/))  has to say on youtube. There are fundamentals that make this play  reasonable but we have to keep a strong mind in the longterm. **Nobody  knows when the hedgefunds will throw the flag, could still be weeks.**  Only then we will win, when the hedgefunds are the first ones to bend  the knee!!!

**HOLD, HOLD, HOLD.**  Whatever happens. Don't check the chart too often. Read this subreddit  or go wanking. Whatever distracts, but don't check your account.

*No financial advise, just mind support.*

We all know that. But they may not get squeezed right away. Why? They are smart guys. They work with smart guys. They most likely purchased calls as hedges against their shares short. 

What do now? Well. The super high borrow rate is going to destroy them. If call holders (other than the self’s) hold to expiration and take ownership of the stock.. then that’s what will likely fuck Melvin if they didn’t purchased calls that offset for the difference in that 40% shares sold short that do not exist (140% sold short right now)

Just food for thought. Hold strong and take ownership of shares if you want to see the real squeeze. Tell your broker NOT to allow your shares to be lent out or sold short. 

Personal opinions here. Do what you want.

Edit: people keep posting about how there manipulation and they said they closed their shorts. There’s only 4 options with a statement like that from
CNBC. 1) they actually closed everything. We know that’s false looking at short interest. 2) they closed a short amount of their short positions. Likely, however it doesn’t change their real exposure so doesn’t matter other than as a scare tactic. 3) they bought calls ans hedged. Highly likely and likely mustered in the CNBC STATEMENT. 4) actual manipulation. Highly doubt. They are a very large multiple billion dollar hedge fund guys. We might be right but don’t confuse that with being smarter or understanding mechanics of a trade gone wrong.

Edit2: if the momentum holds AND majority of shares owned are not sol( diamond hands) then we will see multiple waves of short squeezing. First will be retail investors (us) who short sold stock without a hedge or sold calls naked and are exercised. After that is when you will see institutional get called in droves as their hedges fail. Melvin is likely not going to get squeezed for a month or more IMO. That said. If it was me I’d hold.

edit3: shit crashed today because momentum didnt hold. it didnt hold cause brokerages literally pulled the rug and delisted the stocks from searches and stopped users from being able to buy. stop loses kicked in and boom hedge fund is saved. I guess this is what happens when you back a fund into a corner with threats of insolvency. they call their buddies and lock you in place so you cant do shit but back off."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165100.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['NOT', 'CNBC', 'CNBC', 'EMENT', 'AND', 'IMO', 'I']|[]

I actually actively trade on ThinkorSwim now and I prefer over Robinhood. After Today's event's I looked over the TOS in Robinhood I don't think a class action isn't going to go anywhere.   


 *I understand that My Account is self-directed, and so that I am solely responsible for any and all orders placed in My Account and that all orders entered by Me or on My behalf are unsolicited and based on My own investment decisions or the investment decision of My duly authorized representative or agent. Accordingly, I agree that neither Robinhood nor any of its employees, agents, principals, or representatives:*   


Robinhood will and probably claim that people are not making educated investments, but rather just following the group of people into the meme stocks, which a part of their argument for blocking buys today along with the fact that their clearing house firm couldn't process the buy requests anymore.   


  *I appoint Robinhood Financial as My agent for the purpose of carrying out My directions to Robinhood Financial in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any attendant risks with respect to the purchase or sale of securities. Robinhood Financial is authorized to open or close My Account(s), place and withdraw orders and take such other steps as are reasonable to carry out My directions. All transactions will be effected only on My order or the order of My authorized delegate, except as described in Section 10*    
*10. Oral Authorization. I agree that Robinhood shall be entitled to act upon any oral instructions given by Me so long as Robinhood reasonably believes such instruction was actually given by Me or My authorized agent>*  


So In this section above, I read this as the fact that Robinhood does have the right to make ""reasonable"" withdraw orders. Again, I am not a lawyer so someone smarter at legal stuff will have to figure this out for me.   


I really don't understand the legal aspect of this, but we might not win the lawyer fight of it.

My dad (born in the US) earned good money from his business back in our home country, and my mom was a chief executive assistant to the CEO for one of the largest overseas reinsurance companies at the time. We were well off. But they left those very cushy positions so that my younger brother and I could experience life in the US, with all of its opportunity, freedoms, and excitement.  


When we moved to the US, things were a little rough at first, but we were ok. My dad's field wasn't in as much demand, but he had a stable job. My mother took up teaching because the reinsurance craze hadn't yet made its way to the States. And since they were prudent with their earnings, we did ok.  


Then 2008 hit. I remember sitting in our living room one day, watching The Suite Life of Zach and Cody with my younger brother, overhearing my parents talk about possibly losing the house. I remember going to school terrified that we would end up homeless. That anxiety stayed with me for years afterwards, and it made school an absolute nightmare. A month later both my parents lost their jobs, and neither could find work. We were literally living off of their savings, with two kids, a car, and a mortgage to boot.  


So in order to immediately continue supporting us, my dad left the US and went back to where we had just left. He worked 14 hour days, away from his family, to make sure that we had food on the table. My mom couldn't find work for years, so she ""baby-sat"" my friends during the summers at our house, which for me was fantastic. Later on I realized the humiliation that must have caused.   


For 8 long years, my father wasn't in our lives. He was working his ass off to support us because of a financial collapse caused by these fuckers. Millions suffered, they got bailouts and bonuses. It directly affected my little brother so much that he got into some really bad stuff a few years ago. And I'm still in therapy to this day working through it all. My family was permanently fractured, and we haven't fully recovered. I don't know if we will.   


This is no longer about the money. Like many have said, this is about sending a message now.   


**Dear Wall Street,**   


**You fucked us into oblivion to pad your own pockets over a decade ago. Millions lost homes, livelihoods, pensions, life savings, and some even their lives. Not a single one of you was brought to justice for deliberately engineering this global disaster. Instead, you were given rewards. You were given praise. Some of you were even voted into office.**  


**Now we're playing by your own rules. And we're beating you. I don't care one bit if your monstrous greed costs you billions. You made a bet, we called your bluff, and we aren't wavering.**   


**This is for my family, and the millions of other families that lost so much more.**

You think this was their idea?  You don't think they knew how this would burn them?

Point69 have been dumping everything and going cash this week.  They are going to blame it on ""retail volatility"" hurting markets and keep gaping it down at open, but they went market short to make big money. Biden

We've already seen the smear campaign from paid mouth pieces like the NYT 

Did they threaten to depress the entire fucking financial system unless they had losses capped?? 

I'm 100% sure that the market drops at 3:45pm again. These fuckers don't even know what to do they have been caught so hard.  The fucking reaction today to the dirtiest and stupidest play they could have chosen... They truly are autists. ""What if we rigged the market briefly while the entire world is watching? ""  

It's a beautiful thing to see all of these short sold companies soar as the short positions get unwound. $gme, $amc, $lgnd, $cpb, sooooo many. They owe a debt to Reddit for starting the chain reaction of liquidations.

#popcorn. #goCash.

PS. If the rumor that Point69 went big into B to stay liquid (and so that that the Fed can't fuck with it), someone with wallet expertise should check and see, a B drop would wipe out Stevie Boy...

1. Everyday they try to cover their shorts and no one sells stock, the stock price would literally double.
2. Everyday they can't cover means they're BLEEDING money due to expensive interest rates they paid to borrow stock.
3. They're getting some help which only means we get more tendies. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS NOT SELL, BLEEDING THEM ALL OUT.
4. They have their tactics and dirty tricks to trap investors but as long as you know why that's happening you'll be fine. Also know the next day they will try to cover again leading to a further rise in stock price. After hours is what they can control so seeing a 10-20% decline after hours don't mean shit.

On top of that, they let you deposit for both 2020 and 2021 right now so you can put up to $12k in. 

I don’t know if any of Vanguard’s any other options allow for quick account setup and depositing as well, but if you already have an account with Vanguard you can literally set up an IRA and fund it in under 20 minutes.

BUT LISTEN UP AUTISTS: you can’t take this money out of the IRA until you’re 50 or else you’ll get taxed to shit. You can buy and sell within the IRA all you want, but withdrawals face a penalty.

I am not a financial advisor, I’m just a full on retard using my IRA to invest in a meme stock. I like this stock.

Get a fidelity account.

Get a second email address if you don't have one, use your buddies, mom's, sisters, wife's bfs, work, whatever phone number and get a new venmo. 

Add your credit card to the new venmo account and venmo your nornal venmo money using the credit card you'll pay a 3% fee or so. Yes you are venmoing yourself money off of your credit card. You got to use a different credit card than the one linked with your venmo. It's called diversifying.

Transfer that money from your venmo to your debit card instantly for another 3% fee. It's now instantly in your bank account.

Deposit into Fidelity using ACH. They give you a certain amount of money to spend before it settles like Robin Hood.

Buy and HoLd.

However, Friday is no different from any other day. Market makers have been hedging calls based on their delta. Because of gamma, a derivative of delta, the delta increases as the price increases with an upper limit of 1. As delta increases for the (call) options, market makers have to buy shares. They are short the options and therefore short delta, so they must buy shares to compensate and remain neutral. This is why we keep calling it a gamma squeeze -- rapidly rising prices cause MM to have to buy shares to remain delta neutral.

This happens every day the stock increases, but nothing special is happening Friday. For all of the (current) call contracts, MM are adequately delta-hedged and they only have to buy shares when the price continues to rise, especially for low delta-high gamma OTM options. Now, Friday could still be big if GME is up big, similar to past days, but there is nothing ""special"" about Friday.

If everybody on this sub were to EXERCISE their options, like people are claiming others should, market makers would have to own 100 shares per contract. However, keep in mind that many of the existing contracts are very ITM and have a delta near 1 already, so MM already own most of the shares needed. Example: If you have a .9 delta call, MM already own 90 of the shares and would only need to buy 10 more should you choose to exercise. Also keep in mind the average level of wealth here -- most of us are buying options because we CAN'T afford 100 shares of a given stock. I guarantee $42,500 is more than 90% of people here have.

TL:DR; GME 🚀 everyday causes gamma squeezes, but nothing special about Friday."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165102.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'ITM', 'MM', 'MM', 'OTM', 'GME', 'RCISE', 'ITM', 'MM', 'MM', 'T', 'I', 'GME']|['MM', 'MM', 'GME', 'MM', 'MM', 'T', 'GME']

After all, it’s only $6 while GME is $300+, so it might moon just like GME did right!?!

WRONG. There’s more to stocks than just its price. Let me teach you something about outstanding shares and market cap.

Market cap = total shares x stock price

Right now the market cap of NOK is 37 billion while GME is 24.24 billion. This makes NOK have GREATER value than GME, NOT less.

In other words, GME IS CHEAPER THAN NOK.

For NOK to jump to $100 a share, that would mean it’s market cap increases by a bit more than 15 times, making it worth 555 BILLION. If it matches GME’s $300 price, that would make it worth over $1 TRILLION. To put things into perspective, if GME was worth $1 trillion, its stock price would be over $13,000!

The main takeaway is: STOP PAYING ATTENTION TO THE PRICE OF THE STOCK. IT DOESN’T MEAN ANYTHING.

The more outstanding shares there are also means the harder it is to move the stock. There’s WAY more NOK shares out there than GME, so good luck getting that to go anywhere.

Finally, GME is the only stock being shorted as heavily as it is. If you don’t know what this means, just know that it means it has more moon potential.

tl;dr: NOK is a distraction. It’s not going to $100. There’s more to a stock than its price. Learn something called “market cap” and “shares outstanding.” Load up on GME. See you at $10,000 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

EDIT: Buying NOK cause it’s cheap and you think it’ll get you more gains than GME is like bringing a bus to the Daytona 500 and thinking you’ll finish first cause you have the biggest engine

EDIT 2: I’m not bringing up valuations cause I think valuations mean shit in this market. They don’t. Anyone with half a brain cell can see that.

I’m bringing it up to SHOW people the relative value of NOK compared to GME so that they don’t think “oh it’s so high already, it’s not gonna go any higher. NOK is low though so it must!!”

This is not even to mention the fact that the more overvalued you are, the harder it is to increase your overall value. It’s easy to go 10x from a market cap of 1B, but it gets harder to go from 10B to 100B, 100B to 1T, etc. The fact that I even have to add this cause you guys are missing my point just shows that the hedge funds are winning in manipulating you guys to spread us out from GME

CNBC has been relentlessly spreading the narrative that the government needs to step in to 'protect' the retail investors from themselves.  As short-selling hedge funds are bleeding billions of dollars, CNBC has the gaul to suggest that it is the retail investors that need to be protected.  

These ultra-wealthy investors have more influence than you could ever imagine, and they are transparently using it to their advantage.  Not only are they using the media to spread fear about these squeezed stocks to drive the price down and push the narrative that the government needs to regulate retail investors, they are also using their power to CENSOR these communities and keep them from exercising their free speech.  

Tech companies, likely influenced by their politician buddies in Washington, have been overtly censoring millions of people from their platforms simply for having political beliefs that they do not support.  Youtube has been banning channels for minor grievances.  Twitter has been silencing thousands of vocal users.  Facebook has been doing the same.  And most recently, the tech companies used their collective monopolistic power to basically destroy Twitters largest potential competitor: Parler.  It was no coincidence that nearly every tech platform and web service decided within a few hours to ban services to Parler.  They all used the same justification, even though their own platforms were equally as guilty, if not moreso, of the same wrongdoings.  It was blatantly coordinated censorship.  And they don't care, because they have the power.  

Droves of people defended these actions as acceptable because these are not government entities, and they can censor anyone they want.  Many smugly pointed out that this censorship is not a violation of the First Amendment.  And they are legally correct (barring any future antitrust legislation), but they are absolutely morally wrong to defend this censorship.  

Free speech is not just a right enshrined by our constitution, it is a cultural ethos and value that has been embraced by all political sides of this country since this country was founded.  Censoring legal speech has been looked down upon and shunned by nearly everyone in this country for 100's of years.  But recently, it seems that this ethos has been set aside as long as it is only those you disagree with who are being censored.  

And then we have WSB and GME.  

The people of WSB rarely if ever talk politics.  We are a massive group of investors who get together to discuss their dumb investment strategies.  People from every background come together and discuss one thing: investing and tendies.  There is no left or right, no red or blue.....only green.  

But now that they are hitting the elites where it hurts, the wallet, the elite are using their power to censor.  

First, we have Discord.  Over 250,000 people on the WSB discord.  [And it was censored for 'hate speech'.](https://gizmodo.com/discord-bans-r-wallstreetbets-for-hate-speech-violation-1846146314)  The most obvious color to paint a group that you want to silence: call them hateful, racist, etc.  

Note that Discord has had significant investment from private equity funds including FirstMark Capital, Greenoaks Capital Partners, Index Ventures, IVP, Greylock Partners, Benchmark, Accel, General Catalyst, Ridge Ventures, Spark Capital, and Tencent Holdings. 

Who do you think pulled the strings on Discord for them to censor the WSB channel?  

And now you have Reddit.  Commentators on CNBC have already called for the WSB subreddit to be banned.  And with Reddit's investor profile, who knows what billionaire may call in an order to censor that subreddit.  

So you see, this isn't just about tech companies censoring those for political beliefs.  This is about censoring anyone who threatens your wealth or power.  Many of those who defended the previous censorships may have said, 'yes, I'm okay with it because I don't like their politics'.  But many of those same people may now see that accepting censorship as a norm may one day come back and hurt them.  We must collectively reject and fight back against censorship, lest it comes to effect us all.  

I truly hope the last few days serve as a wake up call for those defending the billionaires and big tech censorship.  We need to get back to 'we the people' controlling this country and not 'we the elite'.  I know the censorship issue may seem like a drop in the bucket to some, but when it comes to our culture and values, that slope can be slippery my friend.

I love this sub and the YOLOs, but I would never risk my hard earned $$ into a single play, like some of you crazy people do.

When I saw the GME hype, I had no faith on it, but I still threw in a little bit of $$, just for fun. After all, I missed the Tesla boat (in fact, I tried to short it and you guys wiped me out lol).

Anyways, this morning I was going to exit some of my positions, when the free fall started. Then, it dawned on me. This is not about money anymore.

I worked hard for my $$, and if I want to buy more GME, or AMC, or whatever, I should be able to do so, even if it's a completely stupid decision. That's how the free market is supposed to work, right?

Now, the brokers are restricting my ability to buy it. In fact, when it dipped hard, I tried to get some more, and I couldn't. I'm fucking pissed. And they dare to say we are manipulating the market!!!

Theory:

1. Melvin Capital has large open short positions in $GME
2. Citadel + Point72 invests $2.75 bln + into Melvin Capital as bailout
3. Citadel is the largest flow buyer of RobinHood (order flow is RH's largest source of revenue), Citadel's HFTs make money off front-running retail trades
4. Citadel colludes with Robinhood to STOP ALL BUY ORDERS on $GME (and others) and depress the stock in order to possibly exit their remaining short positions
5. Robinhood SPINS the halt of ALL demand to 13 PUBLICLY listed stocks. This is to HELP YOU! -- ""We continuously monitor the markets and make changes where necessary.

Can we get some help putting docs and circumstantial evidence together on RH - Citadel - others' collusion?

\---

**A.** Citadel is routinely the LARGEST order flow client via 606 SEC Disclosure Forms -- [https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHF%20SEC%20Rule%20606%20and%20607%20Disclosure.pdf](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHF%20SEC%20Rule%20606%20and%20607%20Disclosure.pdf) [https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q3%202020.pdf](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q3%202020.pdf)

**B.** RH settles a SEC probe in Q4 '20 "" failed to properly inform clients it sold their stock orders to high-frequency traders and other firms"" -- [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-17/robinhood-to-pay-65-million-to-end-sec-probe-into-stock-orders](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-17/robinhood-to-pay-65-million-to-end-sec-probe-into-stock-orders)

The SEC Complaint above -- [https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2020/33-10906.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2020/33-10906.pdf)

Interesting Side Note:  For most orders of more than 100 shares, the analysis concluded that Robinhood customers would be **better off trading at another broker-dealer because the additional price improvement** that such orders would receive at other broker-dealers would likely exceed the approximately $5 per-order commission costs that those broker-dealers were then charging. **The analysis further determined that the larger the order, the more significant the price improvement losses for Robinhood customers—for orders over 500 shares, the average Robinhood customer order lost over $15 in price improvement compared to Robinhood’s competitors, with that comparative loss rising to more than $23 per order for orders over 2,000 shares.**

**C.** Possible Sequoia Capital and White House collusion? How many people stand to lose money from Melvin Cap? Hearsay but putting it here for now.

RH ToS states they reserve the right to de-list or halt trading for any reason they see fit.  However, Section 13 of FINRA's prohibited behaviour states https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/choosing-investment-professional/prohibited-conduct

""13. Using manipulative, deceptive or other fraudulent methods to effect a transaction in, or induce the purchase or sale of, a security.""

If RH is able to remove the ""buy"" option of a stock at any time, then consequently, they could also remove the ""sell"" option at any time.  This removed confidence that I would be able to sell my rightfully owned stock when I felt the time was right, and compelled me to sell before realizing maximum potential gains. Therefore, I am suing RH in small claims for violations of FINRA regulations, as well as their relationship with Citadel for $6500 as just compensation for their manipulative tactics.

Godspeed to you all here that are still in on this roller coaster of a ride.  I will be rooting for you to be dining in Valhalla on chicken tendies very soon!

Fuck RH, fuck Melvin, fuck citadel, fuck the SEC, and fuck the complicit media!

Edit:  What I'm talking about here is a lawsuit in small claims, myself versus RH only.  This is not to be construed as legal advice for any of you other autists out there.  This is the best course of action for me alone.  You all will have to determine yourselves whether it is more meaningful and impactful to file in small claims or join a class action.

&#x200B;

As you're all aware, Point72(along with citadel) injected \~2.7B into Melvin.  The reason why I bring this up is because Point72's owner, Steven Cohen formerly ran SAC capital. Point72 is a family office, SAC was a hf. Cohen and friends got into shit for insider trading along with paying off research firms to get access to information before anyone else to be the first to profit. They engaged in frequent insider trading which they referred to as black edge and emailed trade ideas with a scale of conviction to show their confidence in the trade. By emailing their trade ideas with a conviction rating and not specifying their source protected Cohen from getting in trouble.  

At the end of all of this, some traders pleaded guilty but Martoma(who served jail time) was Cohen's super bitch because he didn't want Cohen to get caught. Cohen closed SAC and made point72 which happens to be performing outstanding well. He paid a $1.8B penalty. Digging a bit [deeper](https://files.adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD/content/viewform/adv102012/Sections/iapd_AdvDrpSection.aspx?ORG_PK=161111&FLNG_PK=02571B2200080189034C92F10037612D056C8CC0), you can see that Cohen has been using material non-public information since 1999. That report shows what they have been caught doing. Imagine all the shit that they got away with. 

Hedge funds have always been doing shady shit and when they get caught, some of them just change their names. Ex. Och-Zif --> Sculptor capital management. 

So why does retail get shit on for trading something that was shorted to shit?"|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165104.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['B', 'I', 'SAC', 'SAC', 'SAC', 'B']|['B', 'B']

I co-own a software development company (ledgerleap.com) and am officially offering to donate my team's time and skills to build out a site and web hosted forum on [wallstreetbets.com](https://wallstreetbets.com) in case the reddit shuts down WSB here. The domain is expensive on namecheap ($96,030) so we created a gofundme to cover the cost of the purchase at [https://gofund.me/4b72713c](https://gofund.me/4b72713c)

We can use a hosted forum software ([https://www.discourse.org/](https://www.discourse.org/)) to power the site and get online fast as a ""just in case"" backup. If reddit goes down, having this online ahead of time will be essential. I was thinking that all moderators here could be invited to moderate the forum on this potential site if they are open to having a backup. I think a first version could be online in 1 week after securing the domain.

We created the gofundme and the rest I leave up to the community and the fates. If the campaign gets traction enough to make the purchase, we are happy to donate the buildout. If the campaign goes over budget, we will apply the extra budget towards building extra features, future hosting costs, and cloudflare (which would be nice to have in case the hedge funds rudely DOS the server). 

Think of this, if even a quarter of the people in here funded $1 then WSB would have the budget to be self-hosted and unstoppable for decades.

The only cause of volatility this high is extremely low liquidity.**

The liquidity is so low because retail has been buying shares at a record rate in the last week, and we are all diamond handing. If they were to allow more retail buy-and-holding today, liquidity would go down even further, causing even more volatility. The brokers know this, so they stopped letting retail buy.

When there are few shares out there, the market makers can’t properly set the bid-ask spreads. Look at how thin the orders are on the Level 2 books for GME. It’s a company with 11-figure market cap. How many shares you have to buy or sell to swing the price 10%? Just a few tens of thousands of shares, a few thousand in some cases. You could swing the entire stock 10% with just a few hundred thousand dollars, creating or destroying billions in paper value. Compare it to the Level 2 books of any other stock in this market cap range. This is insane.

**What is the true float of GME? How many shares have retail investors bought up and are now diamond handing?**

This is the big question here. There’s only 70M shares of GME outstanding, but I suspect very little is truly floating. Yes, daily volume is huge, but it’s the same few shares being passed back and forth between HFTs. There are \~10M Robinhood accounts and some estimate up to 50% of users own some GME. There’s nearly 5M subscribers to WSB now. Let’s say 5M retail investors have gotten in on GME. If we owned 7 shares each, we now own half the outstanding shares. If we all diamond hand, there are literally not enough shares for the shorts to buy to cover (remember, this stock is shorted 140% of float) This is a massive problem for the shorts and their brokerages. No one actually knows how much float is locked away, but substantial portion is now out of the market and being offered for prices like $4200.69.

**Why did brokerages shut down buying today, but not selling?**

Both the retail and the prime brokerages know how big the order books are. They also know how deep in the hole their clients who shorted GME are. **There are likely many accounts deep underwater at the prime brokerages, but their accounts can’t be liquidated because the short positions can’t be closed. There are not enough shares being offered for sale for all the short positions to cover.** They could buy up the entire sell order book (squeezing the price to infinity) and not even be close to covering all their shorts. The brokerages know this. The brokerages know they themselves will be left holding the bag if their clients go bankrupt, so their only choice is to ride it out and try to trip the circuits before everything spirals out of control. By banning buying and allowing selling, they are simultaneously reducing buying demand for the stock and letting their clients with short positions close the positions, reducing their own exposure.

**Could an infinity squeeze theoretically bring down the whole system?**

It’s unlikely, but theoretically yes, it could. Let’s do a thought exercise – suppose retail has bought up 60M of the 70M GME shares outstanding and ransoms all of them for $1B per share. The spot price on the remaining 10M floating shares starts going up and up. More and more HFs holding short positions are now in negative balance positions, and the brokers need to liquidate all their positions. The only problem is that there is no one willing to sell GME to them below $1B per share. The infinity squeeze has begun.

In an infinity squeeze, the short HFs go bankrupt, with their prime brokerages left holding the obligations. Who is in the prime broker business? The big banks. They would now have to close out the short positions at $1B per share. The banks, unable to afford this, would need to either break the contracts or declare bankruptcy. You either have the fundamental undermining of the contract laws governing the system, or the failure of every large bank. The whole system goes under.

Again, the above scenario is extremely unlikely to happen, but you see how it is theoretically possible. We are not ransoming shares at $1B each. We are only ransoming them for a measly few thousand dollars.

**What is the endgame?**

I don’t know, I really don’t. You retards are testing the limits of the system, and no one knows how this will end. The banks and brokerages could stick it out, retail will get bored and fold, and everything goes back to normal. Or, we could all diamond hands it until the end, force a series of cascading failures in the system we all live in, and go back to living in huts and bartering. Either way, this will go down as an historical moment in time, possibly leading to a fundamental redesign of the rules of the market.

Current day politics have people at each others throats, people are currently bracing for civil war. Unity is desperately needed in the US. Label me a conspiracy theorist or whatever you want but I have reason to believe this is on purpose. The elites and top wall street investors want people at each other’s throats. It keeps their money safe. Shit like $GME threatens their power. They want the common man to hate each other so they can keep making money and stay safe.

So what’s the point of this post? Well I believe that we could potentially change the landscape of US politics. You see how scared the Hedge Fund guys and Robinhood are. You boys have brought everyone on either side of the political spectrum together. You boys have created unity, and it’s important to keep this unity up.

Public, Stash, and Webull have said it is because their clearing broker, Apex Clearing told them too. Note Robinhood uses its own clearing broker now, Robinhood Securities. It left Apex in 2018. Some, like TD Ameritrade, do self-clearing. Although TDA also uses a separate, affiliated clearing broker similar to Robinhood in addition to self-clearing.

[https://twitter.com/Stash/status/1354839916761518083](https://twitter.com/Stash/status/1354839916761518083)

[https://twitter.com/public/status/1354826467184578571](https://twitter.com/public/status/1354826467184578571)

The clearing brokers are not the end of the chain. They route orders to market makers who can internalize the order (take the other side) or send it to an exchange.

It goes like this:

Retail customer places order -> Retail Broker -> Clearing Broker -> Market Maker -> 1) Internalize or 2) Exchange.

SEC Rule 606 requires all broker-dealers to report the % they route they orders to and their routing policies. For example, for September 2020 nonS&P500 (aka GME, among others) orders, Robinhood routed between 38% and 65% of its various order types (market, limit, etc) to Citadel.

[https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q3%202020.pdf](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q3%202020.pdf)

TD Ameritrade and its affiliate clearing broker sends up to 40% of orders to CITADEL.

[https://www.tdameritrade.com/disclosure.page](https://www.tdameritrade.com/disclosure.page)

It's well reported that Citadel and Point72 backed up Melvin Capital on their short GME position. (Note Citadel is actually multiple companies, including the asset management company then the market making company. I'm not sure which company actually loaned money for the shorts. Wiki says the market maker is a subsidiary of the asset management company).

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel\_LLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_LLC)

So this is unconfirmed speculation at this point, but is it possible Citadel told all the clearing brokers routing to it to halt buying or it would withdraw it's business? If so, that seems like clear market manipulation, especially given its interest in the short positions of Melvin.

Even so, why would it matter? Other market makers like Virtu Americas should be able to step in and take the order-flow business that Citadel won't... right?

Can anybody with time on their hands pull the Rule 606 disclosure reports for all the retail and clearing brokers and make a map to see who is involved? Then see what hedge funds are related to the various market makers? Who are the other shorts? I've only seen Melvin and Citron, but they don't have the entire short position on GME do they? The coordinated shutdown of retail buyers today certainly seems like collusion.

People caught on and bought in to that DD.

THIS IS ABOUT MONEY. PURE AND SIMPLE. END OF STORY.

That's the end of the story? YES. That's the end of the story. Now that the story is short media coverage has to spin it into something that it's not. Trying to somehow figure out if there is some ulterior motive going on.

Spoiler: IT's ABOUT MONEY.

This isn't about populism, this isn't about ""pushing back against the suits"", this isn't about David vs. Goliath, this isn't about investing. This is about taking advantage of an inefficiency in the market.

All of that being said, the discussion may have changed in the last few hours now that multiple brokerages have ceased buying on these stocks. This is again a different story and should be framed in that light.

I'm on IBKRs, not RH as I can't get it outside of US, so there's my position on it before I go further.

In this event of HUGE market swings, what IS the realistic scenario if every single diamond hand cashed up for HUGE gains and rushed the withdrawals department for their dues?

Can these companies actually hold on with their heads above water in this case?

Yes funds ""are held in client trust accounts"" and ""segregated"" 

But it's clear citadel run the show. So...... If they stop orders, isn't this a huge finger pointing towards their actual liquidity also?

Pretty sure most of you know $FUBO has been shorted like crazy since the news of their Victory acquisition. It shot up 33% with the news and has since lost most of those gains. I'm here to tell you why the shorts are wrong and why this is a MASSIVE opportunity for us.

First, I'd like to address the issue of profitability. It was founded in 2015and being a young, growing company and isn't profitable yet. To put things into perspective, even Netflix which was founded in 1997 wasn't profitable until 2003. Fubo has more competition today than Netflix did back then, but it's still growing rapidly. 

Q3 Results: [https://www.yahoo.com/now/fubotv-announces-q3-2020-results-210500756.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/fubotv-announces-q3-2020-results-210500756.html)

* Revenues were $61.2 million, a 47% increase year-over-year on a pro forma basis, or +71% excluding 2019 licensing revenue from the FaceBank AG business, sold in July 2020. This growth was driven by continued subscriber expansion, an increase in subscription Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and growth of advertising sales:  

   * Subscription revenue increased 64% year-over-year to $53.4 million.
   * Advertising revenue increased 153% year-over-year to $7.5 million.
* Paid subscribers at quarter end totaled 455,000, an increase of 58% year-over-year.
* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) per month was $67.70, up 14% year-over-year.
* Total content hours streamed by fuboTV users (paid and free trial) in the quarter increased 83% year-over-year to 133.3 million hours.
* Monthly active users (MAUs) watched 121 hours per month on average in the quarter, an increase of 20% year-over-year.

Q4 Preliminary Results:

[https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Announces-Preliminary-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Revenue-and-Subscriber-Growth/default.aspx](https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Announces-Preliminary-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Revenue-and-Subscriber-Growth/default.aspx)

* Q4 total revenue is expected to be between $94-$98 million, a 77% to 84% increase year-over-year.\* Prior guidance was $80-$85 million.
* Paid subscribers at year-end are expected to exceed 545,000, an increase of more than 72% year-over-year. Prior guidance was 500,000-510,000 subscribers.

It smashed its previous guidance because sports and normality are returning. Also note that Fubo was still growing rapidly during the pandemic despite the lack of sports which is its primary focus. This is huge and it will continue to grow faster as sports start to return to normal. 

*FUBO* is estimated to announce *earnings* between Jan 25, 2021 and Feb 03, 2021

&#x200B;

Most of us know that Fubo was opportunistically  hit by short sellers (Kerrisdale/Rich Greendfield) as their lock up period expired. This made the stock tank considerably from it's high of $60. The short argument is that integrated sports betting is a pipe dream, and that its not profitable yet. 

As mentioned earlier, it took Netflix a while to scale up and become profitable. At the rate Fubo is growing, they are going to be profitable sooner than later. This isn't even an argument to me, as they scale up a few things will happen:

\- Customer acquisition costs will become a lower and lower percentage of revenue.

\- Since they license their content, they need scale to turn those licensing costs to profit (just like Netflix did)

\- More customers mean they can charge more for advertising. (More on this later)

Fubo very clearly addressed the issue of integrated sports betting with the acquisition of Vigtory. The bear thesis is weakening significantly. Almost nonexistent. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, on to the NBA:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/12/31/fubotv-solid-positioning-for-sports-betting/?sh=5fadb7c69cb5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/12/31/fubotv-solid-positioning-for-sports-betting/?sh=5fadb7c69cb5)

""Over the past few years, Sky Media led investment rounds in FuboTV along with Fox for a 39% stake. This investment round was increased in late 2017/early 2018 with Sky Media holding Board positions. The former NBA commissioner was also part of the last $15 million round. Media has gone through some very big M&A shifts at the top-level with Comcast acquiring Sky and Disney acquiring 21st Century Fox. However, for FuboTV’s formative years, the company was influenced by arguably the top sports betting company in the world – Sky Media from the UK. The Comcast-owned Sky Media is still a backer for FuboTV along with Disney.""

David Stern, the late former NBA commissioner was involved in funding of Fubo. The current NBA commissioner Adam Silver worked extremely closely with his mentor. I've been a lifelong NBA fan and I had doubts in Adam Silver but I think he's done a fantastic job with the NBA.

Why am I bringing up the NBA?

[https://www.casino.org/news/nba-considering-betting-broadcasts-could-help-draftkings/](https://www.casino.org/news/nba-considering-betting-broadcasts-could-help-draftkings/) (check the date of this and check the date of the Fubo Vigtory announcement)

People are missing some key elements to the NBA announcement: this announcement was made literally the DAY after the Fubo Victory acquisition. People are missing the link between the NBA and Fubo, let alone the timing. Fact check me, they were announced a day apart and Fubo is the ONLY company with plans of an integrated sports betting broadcast platform. 

The NBA wants to get into this because they know viewers watch games for longer with sports betting and fantasy leagues (which is why I think they threw in DraftKings)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, lets look into two key acquisitions: 

\- Vigtory - Fubo acquired them and put their co-founder in charge of integrated sports betting along with their licenses and tech. 

Balto - This one is another thing bears are missing. They claim this acquisition was to get into sports betting, it wasn't this was for their fantasy sports platform which Fubo is also planning on integrating.

&#x200B;

Fubo is going to be an absolute monster going forward. It is trading at a discount thanks to shorts [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fubo](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fubo)

34m shares short, 62.5% of float shorted. This thing is PRIMED for an epic squeeze AND it's valued at a discount right now. 

Since the Vigtory acquisition, new price targets came out ranging from $47 to $60. 

Short term, I'm confident this thing will pop soon. It was hammered down after the Vigtory announcement by shorts, followed by a low volume selloff Friday. It's trading at imo, a massive discount right now.

Long term, this thing is shaping up to be a unique competitor in streaming/sports betting.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - get in long, one way or another. Commons, LEAPS, anything... this thing is going to explode as we inch towards earnings (expected late January to mid-February). We got massive revenue growth, we have strong tailwinds with the return of sports, we have the NBA basically saying they're in as long as Fubo can execute."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165104.csv|StockTicker|['$FUBO', 'DD', 'NSTER']|['DD']|['$FUBO', 'SSIVE', 'AG', 'TV', 'TV', 'NBA', 'A', 'UK', 'TV', 'NBA', 'NBA', 'NBA', 'I', 'I', 'NBA', 'I', 'NBA', 'NBA', 'DAY', 'NBA', 'ONLY', 'NBA', 'I', 'RIMED', 'AND', 'DR', 'LEAPS', 'NBA']|['AG', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV']

1205|l6fgbn|The other post about SLV is absolutely correct. Silver is by far the most manipulated market in the world.

Second, everyone buy and hold GME through at least $1000 before buying silver because the shorts are still at 139% of the float so there is a technical reason to stay long until they really cover.

Third, the other post said to buy miners, but that won’t cause a silver squeeze. The miners will benefit from the squeeze, but buying miners alone does nothing to actually beat the manipulating banks at their own game in silver.

So here’s how you do it:

Buy SLV directly.  If you want options buy in the money or near the money to force true hedging (buying) by the market maker.  This is a very old and slower moving market than equities so unless you are buying leaps, SLV shares are the way to go anyways.  Alternatively, buy silver physically or even force delivery through purchasing futures if you are rich and can store it.  Physical silver purchases carry a premium over spot price though so you end up causing more physical silver to be purchased by simply buying SLV.

By purchasing SLV, more shares will be created and SLV will have to purchase massive amounts of physical silver to hold in their vaults because the etf has to remain backed by physical silver.  

Silver is a much larger market than GME, but the paper traded gold market is 100x the physical market.  If we force more physical purchase and delivery of silver, the paper traders will be required to buy it in real life and deliver it. Creating a positive feedback loop just like a short squeeze.

Lastly, the fundamental case is that government stimulus combined with fed money and reopening economy will cause inflation, and that government debt loads mean dollar debasement. Lest someone say we are manipulating the market (as big banks have literally been doing for decades). We like the stock!

Let’s get GME to the moon and then park all of the winnings in SLV. Could take a couple of months to fully moon as delivery of silver takes time but it really could go to $1000 from $25.  If GME took down a single hedge fund, this would take down JPM. 

Please share, it’s hard to break through right now 

Power and tendies to people! 

TLDR: don’t sell GME till over $1000 and then move it all to SLV and hold for 3+ months"|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165117.csv|StockTicker|['SLV', 'JPM']|['JPM']|['GME', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'GME', 'GME', 'SLV', 'GME', 'JPM', 'GME', 'SLV']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'JPM', 'GME']

SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

How many people have you heard talking desperately about getting out of the house? About how “I just wish I could go to the movies again!” People are FED UP with being cooped up inside. As soon as spring/summer rolls around AMC is going to sell out every single showing. 

But people will be scared to go out still!!? But they will be careful!!!?

Bullshit. I’ve seen soccer moms and dads cut off locks from Chicago city playgrounds during the height of the pandemic just to get some playtime in for their kids. People are tired AF of waiting around at home and are desperate to go to the movies, buy some overpriced popcorn, and get 5 hours of sugar sweats from pounding a pound of sour patch kids.

I REALLY LIKE THE AMC STOCK.

What happens when movies sell out over and over again? Price hikes! What happens when prices get hiked on a product that has zero marginal cost like a movie license? Huge profits! What happens when you buy a coke for $15 that cost $0.30 cents? Huge profits! What happens when your labor cost is minimum wage because everyone is unemployed (ok nevermind they always paid minimum wage)? Huge profits! What happens when a year of huge profits allows you to reinvest in a new and better movie experience and drive further growth? Huge profits! What happens when the stock is immensely oversold short? Huge profits! 

I REALLY LIKE THE AMC STOCK.

I don’t know about you, but I grew up as a kid salivating at GameStop and thrilled to go to AMC. Let’s bring back the good ole days.

**Strategy**

1. Get data on previous week’s WallStreetBets discussion from Quiver Quant API.
2. Identify the five most mentioned stocks.
3. Buy those stocks at the start of the trading week, sizing positions based on how much they were talked about in proportion to each other.
4. Sell positions at the end of the trading week.
5. Repeat

EDIT GUESS THEY""RE NOT IDK THEYRE FUKT THO

&#x200B;

Like many of you I woke up today trying to see if I was gonna hit my second M and was a little shocked at seeing that I couldn't get a bid or ask on any options that I had. I have literally never seen this before, and honestly I didn't know it was legal for MM to not offer any bids or asks at all.

I've also been wondering why Citadel bailed out Melvin. What is their relationship? Well see, Citadel is one of the largest market makers in the US. They are the ones that sell us the options that let us weaponize degen and yolo into riches that we promptly burn up. Citadel also holds a large short position, so presumably they bailed out Melvin because they did not want to start a liquidity cascade that was gonna eat them alive too.

Questions I've been wondering and I think I have a theory for

1. Melvin was supposed to go BK at GME 175. They claimed they exited their short. What happened?
2. If you go here [https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings\_tab\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link) 3rd page Melvin has had 54k put positions on GME since 2015. Who wrote those?
3. How did GME get naked shorted when only Market Makers are allowed to naked short?

I suspect that Melvin did go BK today. They got acquired by Citadel. They bought those put options from Citadel and Citadel has held the naked short position all these years. Risk management at these market maker desks will absolutely pull a bid and not offer if they think they are at risk of blowing up the firm. IMO Citadel market maker desk didn't trade shit the first 15 minutes of the day because they were trying to figure out what the fuck to do. I don't know if they made a last minute deal this morning or pulled capital together or what but they are on their fucking last leg.

Look at Melvins long positions, a lot of them fucking sold off heavy early today. PINS. PYPL. JD. NFLX. IMO options were not traded by Citadel during first 15 minutes today while they sold off what they needed from Melvin to maintain liquidity.

I made this post a few weeks ago about why market indices are at a risk this week and last week if we see any red. Gamma is basically almost negative. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzz0jn/been\_too\_long\_since\_weve\_had\_a\_bearpocalypse\_post/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzz0jn/been_too_long_since_weve_had_a_bearpocalypse_post/)

Citadel is almost BK and everyone can fucking smell it. We get one last big green on GME IMO and that will be the death kneel of Citadel. I don't know if it happens thursday, or friday, but it's coming. You YOLO on some 550c expiring Friday if you see volume in them. IF you see market red as shit tomorrow, you buy index puts and puts on whatever Melvin and Citadels longs were and you lean into it because not only is Citadel going to liquidate but the whole market is likely to go with it.

Good luck

Please [check out my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5q4nd/option_analysis_and_how_it_will_effect_nok_price/) from yesterday where I predicted stock volatility today based on option data if you're interested in seeing where we came from to where we are now.

&#x200B;

This post aims to do 4 things -

1. We'll determine if I was correct yesterday based on todays events
2. We'll look at what we may see tomorrow based on todays data
3. We'll examine what all of this means for Nokia as a whole going forward
4. TL;DR and Conclusion

# Part 1 - Analyzing the Analysis

In my last post, I projected that on 26 January 2021, almost all of the crazy volatility was done at the $5 price range for $NOK. That determination was made based on Open Interest in both $5 Calls and Puts, and the amount of coverage major institutions had likely achieved during yesterday's trading hours.

This morning, shortly after market open, the stock price broke $5 and immediately experienced a fluctuation of \~$0.30 up and down over about 10 minutes.

[Between 09:58 and 10:12](https://preview.redd.it/hpaqyk8aoxd61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9ef51c0cd22e787b514845a83888f808eb35ee6)

Was I correct in my assessment? Yes and no.

Why yes -

Based on yesterdays numbers, I was correct. The institutions who had written the $5 call and put options had successfully covered themselves.

Why no -

There was a high volume of $5 calls and puts that were purchased this morning which likely lead to those same institutions having to buy more coverage. The rapid purchasing of shares by institutions as the price broke $5 is likely what caused this small jump. This is always something to watch for as the market is opening, especially when the stock is so high volume like $NOK.

In my post yesterday, I made a point that there will be more volatility as we approach the next significant strike price of $7. That is exactly what we witnessed today.

[10:37](https://preview.redd.it/x3f0q5ogpxd61.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa6a82867fba19dd661630cccd19b02bbdf17900)

At 10:37, prices got close enough/surpassed $7 and a wild combination of institutional buying and bullish market sentiment lead to \~100,000,000 shares being traded over the course of about \~30 minutes. Prices jumped to nearly $10 and rapidly dropped back to around $7 as institutions scrambled to cover $7 calls and puts. I'm sure there was also quite a bit of panic buys/sells as well as short sellers getting involved.

Was I correct in my assertion yesterday? Yes.

I had pointed out yesterday that this was likely to happen given the growing number of call/put options at $7 and institutions' need to cover. I would add that I did not expect the volume to reach such insane numbers during this period, however.

After these two major movements in $NOK, we experienced several more halts as well as a press release from Nokia. The [press release](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/27/nokia-comments-on-trading-activity-of-its-stock/) was essentially an official statement to let various regulatory agencies know that Nokia management had nothing to do with stock price rise. Following the statement, prices rose to $7.77 before gradually coming back to \~$6.60 at close of market.

I did obviously could not project a halt by the exchange followed by a press release from Nokia, but I hope everyone here was able to stay calm through the waves.

If I missed anything or anyone has a different perspective, please comment! I love criticism and I'm pretty retarded.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Part 2 - Today's Data and what it could mean for tomorrow

For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to provide aggregate numbers (volume and open interest) for options that are of significance from all dates. I put together all of this data immediately follow market close on 27 January 2021.

Here we go:

|Type|Strike Price|Volume|Open Interest|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Call|$7|511,986|502,584|
|Call|$8|213,985|43,063|
|Call|$9|230,863|62,627|
|Call|$10|842,327|325,966|
|Put|$7|25,131|62,650|
|Put|$8|2,078|1,689|
|Put|$9|1,215|1,144|
|Put|$10|5,500|1,787|

What can we take from looking at these numbers?

1. The ratio of calls to puts is fucking insane. Market sentiment for $NOK is incredibly high based purely on the high volume of movement in calls and the insanely high open interest in OTM call options. In other words, a massive number of investors believe this stock will continue climbing. This can end up being a self-fulfilling prophecy as sentiment grows more bullish and prices continue rising.
2. Because it looks like market sentiment is growing to be even more bullish, I expect the volume of OTM calls to stay high. However, the Open Interest (number of contracts in circulation) has actually stayed roughly the same. That means that the institutions who sell the contracts aren't writing more because they think those contracts will be ITM in the near future (bullish). It also means that we might see *less* sudden volatility as we go past the $7 and $10 mark.
3. The number of ITM puts has gone up at $7, meaning we may see sudden and temporary downward shifts the next time we pass $7. **If/when this happens, don't stress. The institutions who wrote the new put options will need to short-sell in order to cover.** There are around 3,000,000 shares that would need to be sold off in order to cover. This brief selloff could trigger some temporary price panic.
4. Trade volume reached a whopping total of 1,078,887,291 by end of market. It was around 300,000,000 yesterday. People are not only watching but throwing their money into the pool as well.

TL;DR -

Things look really good going forward, with some upcoming turbulence around $7 from institutional short selling and panic sellers who don't have 💎🙌.

# Part 3 - What does it all mean?!?!

Well, first off I'd like to point out that people with money are starting to get upset. As I'm sure everyone else has been seeing, media coverage of us has been absolutely insane. News agencies are trying to brush off stocks like $NOK by saying they have no value, without actually discussing the excellent financials and major developmental announcements made by Nokia for the future.

* $NOK generated a net income of [\~$730,000,000](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NOK/financials?p=NOK) in the last 12 months.
* $NOK has an excellent [balance sheet](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NOK/balance-sheet?p=NOK).
* $NOK has a [free cash flow](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NOK/cash-flow?p=NOK) of $1,936,000,000. That's a shitload of money that will likely be put towards future endeavors and development.
* $NOK has been consistently on the frontpage of most major news networks in a positive light. Publicity like this will generate more investment which creates more financial potential for growth.

With that being said, the only short interest data I have is from 31 December 2020, which showed only \~50,000,000 shares short. I would guess that the number has grown dramatically due to various speculation about WSB and $NOK value. It will also grow as institutions cover their puts options.

As price rises, I expect we will see similar sentiment from the news that we've seen with $GME and $BB. Will there be a squeeze like $GME? Probably not, but that doesn't mean there cant be a margin call as the prices rise, which will eventually force prices upwards significantly.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# TL;DR and Conclusion

Put simply, $NOK is extremely bullish with data and gains to show for it. And as much as the news wants to believe, $NOK's financials and prospective future is actually pretty fuckin' solid.

Why is this all happening now? Our community has consistently identified excellent value investment, and now people are looking at $NOK because we did. Trade volume didn't jump 300% for no reason.

Disclaimer and my Holdings -

I currently own 10 of [these bad boys](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NOK210716C00005000?p=NOK210716C00005000). Those are $5 Call options that expire 16 July 2021. I'll be holding these for a while 🚀.

I worked pretty hard on this throughout the day so I really hope this helps some people. If you see anything wrong or something that should be changed, please let me know!

We’re living in a defining, once in a generation opportunity right now. 

Because of that, euphoria is also at an all time high where pretty much 100% of the sub believes there’s no chance we can lose from here on out, including me. As long as we keep buying and 💎👐 the shorts will have to close, and we'll all be rich while simultaneously punishing the excessively greedy. 

However, there are very few gaurantees in life and I've yet to see a post to discuss ways we could all possibly get blindsided and left holding bags while waiting for the shorts to close. 

This is probably not an exhaustive list and I am in no way an expert (definitely an idiot). It's merely meant to get us thinking and ancipating our reaction if there's evidence that any of these or other risks is likely to happen. Basically I want the actually smart people to come in an explain why I'm wrong and/or add more risks not in this list. 

1. The SEC determines GME etc. are too big of a risk and suspends trading for 10 days.

What would the reaction be from the hedges that are short and retail investors? Would they still be able to close somehow during that period? Would it fuel the rebellion even more and drive the price even higher when trading resumes? 


2. The Hedge Funds, media, etc. scare tactics and lies work, trigging a waterfall of paper hands selling. 

There is a ton of misinformation being intentionally circulated right now and we are vulnerable because of it. Stuff like ""Melvin has already closed, has to close completely by Friday, the open short % is a lot smaller than we think, bots are trying to distract us from GME, etc."" The question is, what signs should we look for that sentiment is changing and hands are getting weaker in case some of their tactics stick? 


3. Melvin has already started to close under our noses.

Is this even possible? Many sources seems to indicate the short percentage has barely changed and that their statment about ""repositioning"" to close GME is complete BS. The volume and price action trends seem to show that is the case as well, but is there a scenario where Melvin could close without initiating a gamma squeeze (assuming we continue to hold)? 


4. Melvin and other short sellers get the option to close their shorts with cash instead of shares

We are gobbling up shares like crazy to try and fuel the squeeze. However, is there a possibility the share lender would let the shorts pay back the shares in cash instead of shares, therefore not causing more of a squeeze?

As I said this is probably not a complete list and maybe some of these aren't actually risks. Anyway, let's talk about these and any others I may have missed so that no matter what happens, we have a plan to deal with it and make sure we're all benefitting as much as possible from this wild experience.

This is a strange coincidence given that Citadel bailed out Melvin's risky bet on $GME to the tune of $2.75 billion.

It's also probably just a coincidence that the purchasing of large tranches of OTM $GME options were responsible for the gamma squeezes we've been seeing (as MMs bought shares to cover these options), and a big enough gamma squeeze could eventually create a tipping point for the MOASS.

“In the interest of mitigating risk for our company and clients, we have  put in place several restrictions on some transactions in $GME, $AMC,  and other securities,” a spokeswoman for TD Ameritrade told MarketWatch,  referring to the ticker symbols of the companies. “We made these  decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market  conditions and other factors.”

It is unclear to me at this point what ""some transactions"" means. Large transactions? Derivates on the stock? Buy orders in general?

If what is written in this article is true, the ""technical difficulties"" that some brokerages were stating yesterday evening are questionable. Maybe someone should read the terms of agreement of TD their TD Ameritrade account and comment if they are allowed to do this. Maybe some SEC rule aplies instead, I am not familiar with this yet.

A Question for today when markets are open:

\- Who is experiencing trading restrictions?

And for the whole community?

\- Are there alternatives?

So shorting well more of stock float, maybe even naked if done so, is ok for institutions, but buying a lot of stock in a collective is not ok. All of this while brokers usually make a lot of money from retail investors trading risky options / derivates, which also result in individuals losing it all.

There are legitimately WSB millionaires made off this one play. This is history, and I'm glad to have witnessed it.

But I'm seeing a worrying trend here. People are beginning to make this into a moral crusade against ""the man"". Taking down the hedge funds because of their over-greed is no longer a way to make crazy money, it's a moral imperative. Giving advice to hold GME forever, just to punish them.

WSB is not the only thing driving GME up. WSB first noticed it and so we got in early, but other players are also involved. We cannot squeeze Melvin to infinity. Eventually, the position will be closed.

I don't know where the top of GME is. It might be $500. It might be $1000. It might be $10,000. But eventually, the stock will revert to its fundamental value. It happens with every short squeeze every time. And someone is going to be caught holding the bag.

If you are one of those ""I'm holding forever"" people, that person losing all their money is going to be you. The stock is going to crash from $100,000 or wherever it ends up, and when you finally decide to sell Robinhood is going to freeze for 15 minutes and it will congratulate you on your $6 sell. Meanwhile the institutional investor with their real broker made a killing. 

Now I can't wait for the loss porn that is coming to this sub in a month any more than the rest of you. That's what this sub is about. But when that happens, remember, it wasn't ""the man"" who made you lose all your money. You were the one who decided to hold at GME $1,000,000 to fuck Melvin. And you loved the feeling of that green dildo so much that you didn't notice the giant red one coming straight for your ass.

We sit there terrified hoping the big guys throw us a bone. For those of us here at WSB the last 5 years this leads to massive disillusionment. And it’s all fun and games because everyone on the inside wins. How stupid is it that there is no transparency to the underpinnings of valuation and that there is 0 regulation of shorting a company and fucking it’s employees beyond 100% float just to control the asset?

When the dust settles be aware there is a massively growing system that does exists which does not allow this that is called decentralized finance. Worth learning about the future early


Edit: I don’t know for sure but I predict The GME situation ends when the government prints the $ to give to Melvin and friends bc this is an inflationary system and that’s what happens. They’ll be upset they didnt just print the $ earlier.

I am not receiving compensation for this post, and this post constitutes my opinion, not investment advice. 

&#x200B;

# Let's imagine you operate a hedge fund

Your hedge fund, let's call it Limonade Capital, or LC for short. You specialize in shorting stocks and have extremely large positions in BB, GME, AMC, NOK, and not much else. Your models all point to one expected 'truth': 

***The shorted stocks are expected to go bankrupt at some point in the future, and you maintain enough capital to hold your short positions until they do.*** 

Now, you've been operating fine on this assumption, but suddenly a bunch of other hedge funds take your same position in all these stocks. One of them, GME, now has more short than float. This is fine, you think, the stock will still go to 0 and everything will be as normal. 

But this time, you shorted a gamer stock. This was apparently a mistake, as the only thing gamers hate more than each other and GameStop are people who don't like gamers. Millions of morons suddenly purchase your stock, GME, and it's now horribly short. You panic and call a meeting. 

&#x200B;

You get all your traders in the meeting, and in between lines of blow and shots, you strategize this theory: 

* Outlast the gamers. These guys will get bored quickly and move onto the next thing/insult each other into ragequitting and be too busy fucking each other's moms to notice. 

You implement this strategy, and sit tight and do your usual media blitz saying the stock is worthless and the company is going to go down the drain yada yada yada. 

Unfortunately, this appears to have merely angered the gamers. They quickly convince all of their idiot friends to buy into GME with them, and suddenly your company is running short of capital. You do the only logical thing: 

* Raise capital to continue to try to outlast them. They'll get bored eventually. 

This appears to be a golden strategy, for about an hour. Your arch nemesis, Sexy Elongated Chad, SEC for short, remembered that time you told him you fucked his mother while playing against him in TESLA vs Gay Bears the game (Find it on steam). He took that personally. He proceeds to add to the stock's hype, and suddenly your gamers have found a whole new source of money as everything he says makes the news. 

You're sweating - you and your hedge fund pals all short now have to find a way to get this stock down to a point that you won't go bankrupt paying all these gamers to go away. You know this: 

* If you close your positions, your company will lose a significant chunk of its value, including the massive investment you just received. 
* Other hedge funds that followed you into this investment can't close their positions without creating a run on the stock - there's simply too many open positions and not enough stock. 
* Your only hope is the gamers getting bored and leaving before you run out of money and *have* to close your positions. 

After doing some more cocaine off your intern's ass, you come up with a new hypothetical brilliant plan. 

***Make the GME investors leave voluntarily before you are forced to close your positions triggering a short squeeze.*** 

You have these tools: 

1. Influence with the media
2. Short positions in AMC, NOK, BB. 
3. Some amount of money to try standard tactics of short laddering, etc. 
4. Make it harder to purchase new positions in GME when these investors realize their mistake. 

You start a media blitz, spreading FUD around GME and explaining how all the investors are going to be bag holders because the short squeeze is over (it hasn't started). 

You start blitzing the public forum with the GME investors, hyping AMC, NOK, and BB, causing a run on purchases there. 

You close all of your short positions in AMC, NOK, and BB, creating a short term short squeeze artificially combined with your media blitz both scaring potential investors away from GME and hyping AMC NOK and BB as you close your positions. 

This creates temporary gains on these stocks that eclipse those of GME - causing the hype herd to consider losing faith in GME and moving to the greener grass. Investors start to waiver and sell, thinking that the squeeze may be over. 

Meanwhile, your influence at the brokers is making it harder to purchase new positions in GME, which is slowly limiting GME's upside. 

You breath a sigh of relief - if enough of GME starts selling for AMC BB and others that you've hyped, there will be enough float to reduce the squeeze magnitude by purchasing shares from GME leaders, then selling them to other hedges in some weird game of pass the hot potato. 

Only problem with this plan: 

1. The play is extremely obvious. 
2. There is no plan B if it fails - you go bankrupt paying out your positions. 

&#x200B;

***If this theory is correct, selling GME is the only thing that can save shorts right now. They've offered a green pasture in other shorted stocks by liquidating their positions en masse, making them have artificial gains. They're trying to convince you to leave GME, go somewhere else, and not come back until they've had a chance to close or convince the SEC to fuck everyone over.*** 

The average short squeeze lasts 1.5 days [(Short Squeeze, 2012)](https://ramurapt.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/short-squeezes.pdf), followed by a minor correction. It's likely that Monday and Tuesday were an initial short squeeze on GME of the paper handed hedge funds, and a slight correction may occur tomorrow. This, combined with a misinformation blitz and the rapid short liquidation on AMC, etc is all an attempt to convince you to switch away from GME and give the more patient short hedge funds a chance to manipulate it to a level that they can accept, instead of a potentially much much larger short squeeze next monday. If Thursday is weak on GME, as the theory suggests, this will make the others look potentially stronger and temp people away.

Then, when you want back, your broker won't let you, saying that the SEC may step in so to limit risk they're just going to prevent people from buying. 

I won't be swayed - the ***only way to lose is to get tempted and sell***. I refuse to be tempted by other stocks."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165120.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['I', 'GME', 'I', 'LC', 'BB', 'GME', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'SEC', 'TESLA', 'GME', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'BB', 'GME', 'FUD', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'BB', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'BB', 'GME', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'BB', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'BB', 'GME', 'B', 'GME', 'GME', 'SEC', 'GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'SEC', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'LC', 'GME', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'GME', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'B', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME']

Nasdaq exchange is threatening to engage with FINRA and the SEC if they “see a significant rise in the chatter on social media channels”. Which is maybe the most arbitrary guideline ever. I SUGGEST A FULL TRADING HOURS POST BLACKOUT TOMORROW (Except for mods if necessary) OR MAYBE BETTER AN AUTO-DELETION OF ANY POSTS MENTIONING THE NAME GAMESTOP OR TICKER GME. And during this time, we all need to know only one thing, which is to BUY GME, and don’t worry about the establishment playing dirty. We are only playing their own game while they try every dirty trick. As long as we keep our diamond hands, none of these scare tactics can or will work.** 

I’m a SPACs guy. I’ve been sitting on the sidelines for this because honestly at first I couldn’t care less. WSB isn’t my thing.

Then I started reading the news. **The hate. The vitriol.** Targeted at who?! Not the guys who shorted 140% of a stock’s float?? But at retail?? Seriously? Every news station I see, every YouTube video from the TV is in protection of the establishment, Melvin, and Wall Street. 

Then I started reading the stories from the small guys. YouTube comments. The Reddit posts. Families **devastated** in 2008. Surviving off beans and rice and out of work. And the hedge funds? They were bailed off and eventually made off with their billions. 

These same folks are ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HISTORY THIS TIME. And these folks know what it’s like to be hurt. **AKA they have COMPASSION**. The number of posts I’ve seen sharing their newfound wealth with someone who needs it … Unfathomable for what I originally had thought of wsb. It’s something Wall Street will never understand. Not a penny of profit goes to charity. Not a penny of profit goes to helping others.

**AND NOW THIS?! NOBODY is on our side except our own damn selves.** 

The brokerages are on the other side. TD Ameritrade restricted GME trading. So called 'Robinhood' sent out a notice that no more options positions may be opened for GME this week.

The exchange itself is on the other side! The Nasdaq CEO is suggesting a trading halt to allow big investors to ‘recalibrate their positions’ and that they will engage FINRA and the SEC if ‘we see a significant rise in social media chatter”. [**https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/will-halt-trading-if-unusual-activity-in-stock-matches-social-media-chatter-nasdaq-ceo-6405741.html**](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/will-halt-trading-if-unusual-activity-in-stock-matches-social-media-chatter-nasdaq-ceo-6405741.html) 

Who was there for us when we got screwed over? **Nobody**. 

“These small and unsophisticated investors are probably going to get hurt by this.” WTF?!? We’ve redistributed billions of wealth away from the ultra-rich, and you’re worried about us getting hurt? **This reads like a feudal lord trying to protect his serfs from the “dangers of freedom”.** Piss off. 

Now that we’ve established that these people are pieces of shit enriching only themselves. First things first. 

# Fundamentals.

This company is still (even at $350!) only trading at a multiple of 3.7x 2020 revenue. Stocks like Blink Charging are literally trading at 1000x 2020 revenue. Why the hell are they complaining about fundamentals now? Chewy is trading at 25x 2020 revenue. If Ryan Cohen can turn GameStop around into an e-commerce business with even a quarter of the success as Chewy - this stock literally DESERVES to be valued at $1000. That puts it at 10x LTM revenue. 

Putting aside balance sheet fundamentals… GME will reach $1000 and that is a conservative estimate. With a short ratio of 6 (days to cover), and pure anger at the establishment raging around the entire US - scratch that, THE WORLD, this PT will be reached with ease.

# LASTLY. The light at the end of the tunnel.

Everyone from the SEC to CNBC to the Nasdaq CEO to the brokerages are fuming at us and they are ready to pull out any damn trick in the book to make this end. Here is the lowdown on what to do next and why none of their threats matters. 

&#x200B;

1. Moves? Buy buy buy buy buy. If you cannot buy options, buy shares. If you can’t buy options or shares, use an alternate broker. If you don’t have one, file a formal complaint against your broker. [https://acadia.sec.gov/TcrExternalWeb/faces/pages/intake.jspx?\_afrLoop=2348712962026382&\_afrWindowMode=0&\_adf.ctrl-state=fw8qhqn1o\_19](https://acadia.sec.gov/TcrExternalWeb/faces/pages/intake.jspx?_afrLoop=2348712962026382&_afrWindowMode=0&_adf.ctrl-state=fw8qhqn1o_19) The SEC may not do anything about it, but having a formal complaint open strengthens the case for the future of civil action. 
2. SEC: The time has inevitably come that the SEC is actively snooping around here. Looking for signs of collusion. Some have said that we need to consider getting a megaphone, an official Twitter account to represent us. But to be honest, that actually seems like the last thing we want. The decentralization of this sub is its power. What is the SEC going to do? Arrest all of us? Track us all down? There is little they can realistically do. Worrying about the SEC directly should not be a priority (unless the investigation is being perpetuated by someone powerful, like the NASDAQ exchange itself is attempting to do).
3. News media? There is just so much misinformation misrepresenting this sub’s position along with CNBC absolutely denigrating us and putting out misleading news reports. “Epic Bubble is Building. Its Less Frothy in China” “You Will Lose Your Money Very Quickly” “GameStop analyst calls it a pyramid scheme” These are literal article titles from CNBC trying to lure us away. All I can do is facepalm at these moron’s hypocrisy. We literally just like the stock. Thank god for guys like Chamath. He is only guy on the other side I heard speak up for us today. There is only one thing we can do here. Never forget. One day it will bite them for being on the wrong side of history.
4. Exchanges threats to halt the market? They can do whatever tf they want. A halt won’t magically bring the price back down. 
5. And the juicy part. Nasdaq exchange threatening to engage with FINRA and the SEC? I think we need a full trading hours GME ticker ban. Or a blackout for all posts, period. The only thing we have to remember is that WE LIKE THE STOCK. And Diamond Hands. 

I will be selling off some of my SPACs and placing a market order for GME at open. It’s go time. I will not sell until the shorts have been squoze."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165120.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['FINRA', 'SEC', 'I', 'GGEST', 'A', 'FULL', 'ADING', 'HOURS', 'POST', 'CKOUT', 'ORROW', 'OR', 'MAYBE', 'ETTER', 'AN', 'ETION', 'OF', 'ANY', 'POSTS', 'ONING', 'THE', 'NAME', 'ESTOP', 'OR', 'ICKER', 'GME', 'BUY', 'GME', 'I', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'TV', 'I', 'ON', 'THE', 'OTHER', 'SIDE', 'OF', 'STORY', 'THIS', 'TIME', 'AKA', 'I', 'AND', 'NOW', 'THIS', 'OBODY', 'TD', 'GME', 'GME', 'CEO', 'FINRA', 'SEC', 'WTF', 'ERVES', 'LTM', 'GME', 'US', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'PT', 'ASTLY', 'SEC', 'CNBC', 'CEO', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'ASDAQ', 'CNBC', 'CNBC', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'FINRA', 'SEC', 'I', 'GME', 'WE', 'LIKE', 'THE', 'STOCK', 'I', 'GME', 'I']|['FULL', 'POST', 'AN', 'ANY', 'NAME', 'GME', 'GME', 'TV', 'TIME', 'NOW', 'TD', 'GME', 'GME', 'CEO', 'LTM', 'GME', 'PT', 'CEO', 'GME', 'GME']

When the market opened and Apex (Robinhood's clearing house) and citadel both stopped new BUY orders on RH, that all changed and fucked over everyone. 

Fucking forgot to include a God damn TL;DR

TL;DR - If robinhood didn't change the rules to spread out the sales of all your ITM contracts you fuckers can't afford to exercise, they would have sold them all at 3;00pm Friday. The market makers would be the only buyers, they sell the shares they were holding to hedge the contracts they sold, they sell all of them at once, large push down then paper hands then stop losses and flash crash.

**BONUS MATERIAL AT THE BOTTOM OF POST.**

\------- now to the real shit.

First off, not a bear or bull, I have GME and will add later yadda yadda. I'm just pointing out an observation.

Second off, this is just a theory. No fucking way I know if this is true. It's gonna sound scary, sure, but I want some genius fucker hedge manager who is pro-GME to tell me how horribly wrong I am.

Robinhood changed the rules and you can't buy any 1DTE or 0DTE positions on GME for 1/29. Ya'll got the memo. That sucks because we ALL know you guys were going to hold on to your positions for EVERY LAST OUNCE OF ROCKET FUEL. (I don't do emojis, sorry.) Robinhood may have just saved you by not letting you.

Most of you fuckers who have options have 100c, 150c, 200c whatever. You know you need money to exercise that - at a cost of $20,000 to exercise for one contract is a little more than most can handle, especially the newbies here.

Under normal circumstances, robinhood would sell your position on Friday back to market at about 3:00pm give or take 5 minutes. The problem is that I've seen the order sheets... It's you lot that owns most of the 1/29 call positions (tiny order sizes... 1 to 5 contracts.) That means most of you won't be able to exercise your position and that means it has to go to market ALL AT ONCE. (Again, this is under normal circumstances.)

What happens when you sell a bunch of contracts at bid to the market? The bid goes down, quite possibly below intrinsic value, the market makers buy it, especially in the last hour of the day, and they do the opposite of what they did last week.

They sell shares against the lower delta. If they are the ones that buy their own contracts back especially if below intrinsic, they sell however many shares the delta was for that contract. They don't want to hold on to those shares if they don't have to. That's not their game.

But they're not just selling for the 350c that's ITM while the underlying is $360. They're selling for the 220c they got at the same time. The 200c they also got. They don't need those covered anymore. So they sell on those as well. The more they sell, the more contracts start becoming OTM and the more they can sell against the lower delta those just became.

If you flush the market with contracts where there is essentially only one buyer - MMs - this kind of thing can happen and you can end up with a potential gamma flush. Opposite of a squeeze. Queue in paper hands and stop losses and you have a very nasty flash crash.

In essence, if Robinhood does NOT do the 3:00pm flush of contracts and instead actually spreads the sales out over the next 2 days, then they saved what could have been a potential flash crash wiping everyone out.

Good luck out there, be safe, make some fucking money, and imagine there are some damn rocket emoji everywhere.

We'll do this to simplify what's going on here, and what's going to happen.

This person is you. You know that there are extremely greedy hedge funds who borrowed and sold the shares to you, betting GME goes to zero. You know that there are extremely greedy lenders that literally lent out shares they didn't even have, just to collect a little more interest on loans.

If you just hold, just sit tight, refuse to sell, the hedge fund shorts will hemorrhage from the absurdly high interest payments on the loaned shares.

It gets even better. If even one person has a single share sold short, in theory you could bankrupt that person by refusing to sell. You hold immense power and control now.

Knowing this, you offer anybody trapped in a short position a lifeline. You say ""hey, I'll let you live, I just need 90% of your net worth for these shares."" What would that person do when faced with the choice between bankruptcy and starting over with 10%? Obv buy the shares back. 

It's literally name your own price now. We have them in checkmate, you just cannot sell. They are fucking terrified because they got caught.

If you own GME and REFUSE TO SELL, then *in theory* the value of a share is equal to the (sum total net worth of everybody and every fund who short sold just one or more shares divided by the total number of GME shares) times 0.90 or so to let them off the hook. They would pay you that.

Now, back to the hive.

I'll let the game theoreticians figure out what happens when you add selling pressure to the WSB swarm. Selling pressure will be a function of risk tolerance. For example, paper hands sell when the GME share they have exceeds 5% of their net worth, etc. We need to estimate average net worth of a GME long, and average risk tolerance.

The game theoretic equilibrium state of a long vs short war probably looks like 50% of shares sold short, 50% longs. The shorts are trying to get the longs to sell, and the longs are trying to get the shorts to buy. 

In this current state, I believe so long as GME is above 50% short interest, the stock will continue to rise.

Don’t let the fear get to you, that’s just 🌈🐻 tactics. What the hedge fund did was illegal (Naked Shorts) and no one noticed. Some smart folks noticed way early and they’re sitting pretty right now, BUT STILL HOLDING. They’re (Hedge Fund Billionaires) the ones in trouble and the SEC will have to look into them more than us because we like the stock, and the company. 

If you start to get paper handed, think of all the times you had to fire up your shitty car, to drive to your shitty job barely making ends meet, to get yelled at by your shitty boss who makes way more than you. Think about how your parents had a house, kids, and nice things at your age while you’re still grinding for a better life and renting an apartment with roommates or working two jobs. They only needed one household income to stay afloat, most of us and our significant others have to work. 

We are only playing the game the boomers invented LONG before we even existed, and they’re just scared because we are playing by THEIR rules and winning. WE LIKE THE STOCK! GameStop is a childhood favorite of many, many Millennials and I still shop there for games before anyone else. We may even see a future with a brighter and better version of GameStop If we continue to HOLD. 

You’re not just holding for tendies, you’re holding onto nostalgia and childhood, and a chance at something better while also holding the billionaires and hedge funds accountable for their Market Manipulation, greed, and illegal activity. The more the government looks, the better for us.

BUY, AND HOLD. For our kin at 375, hang tight we’re en route just grabbing some fuel and rations. 

We MAY go down swinging, but at least we’ll show the billionaires that even gods can bleed and to mind their criminal activity in the future.

This is tantamount to market manipulation. By restricting retail investors to trade by stating they do not want to take on extra risk ( this is nonsense as I was not using any margin) is not true. Simply put, its my money and I can sell puts if I want to.

The predictions occured early (no reason to complain you missed out) and plenty of well written analysis were provided for people to make their own decisions on what to do. Also, a boatload of memes, ""can't stop, won't stop, Gamestop"" quotes, and if awards were a stock they would be spiking in value due to this subreddit. 

Inevitably there will be a movie and more of the truth will come out that this is a random group of retail investors and that hedge funds are the ones who should be investigated by the SEC for decades of privately sharing information and swaying the market with their price targets and interviews on the news. 

Not only are us retail investors curtailed on various platforms on when we can trade and what types of trades we execute pre/post market there is already information asymmetry with the information hedge funds with deep pockets can pay for and what we have access to. Yet somehow, sharing information publicly where even hedge funds can view it is seen by these delinquents as ""unfair"". I call bull and also call a Netflix movie on all this!

Stars:
- r/deepfuckingvalue
- wsb mods
- @chamath
- Elon, cause wtf not
- Cramer
- Gamestop board (and some old board who sold a bit too early...)
- other boards of heavily shorted stocks. (AMC, AXDX, BBBY, FIZZ, etc...) 
- who else would the group root for? 

Evil people who lost boatloads of $$
- Melvin Capital
- Citron
- companies that bailed out Melvin
- Random hedge funds that followed suit with their shorts

If I was buying calls on the movie date I would aim for a late fall 2021 expiry. But, I would pick up some additonal calls at good value for an end of summer time frame. Who's in this to expose what is really happening in the market with the hedge funds? 

Netflix, if you want a smash hit - you have one. You just need to dig deep and show what is really happening. 

The tide has changed hands and here we are. Stand tall 💎f'ing👐. ✌️

Just a shell company.

This company has 10 shares, which are traded freely in a market, lets say they trade for $1. This share has been shorted 14 times. Each of those shorts has a margin account of $1, in total $14 exists to guarantee their short positions. For each $1 of stock, $1.4 of collateral is present (the tendies).

Lets say, savvy investors realize that the $1 investment corresponds to $1.4 of capital of the short side of the trade, and bid the price up to $2. Now, at that price, shorts are required to provide $2 per share in margin. Now each $2 outlay corresponds to $2.8 of short capital. So, on and so forth $4 and $4.8, until enough short positions are covered or are liquidated, that each marginal investment of $1 nets less than or equal to $1 in short capital, as long as shorts keep meeting margin calls.

Assuming an even split of long and short recouping the difference, the value of a share of GameStonk is literally worth a multiple of itself, 1.2 with current 140% short interest..

These hedge funds really think they are shorting GameStock, but they are really just investing in the South Sea Trading Company Bubble.

I saw the post with the NY Times article that Point72 is down 15% because its backstopping Melvin Capital. I thought it would be smart to review their holdings to see what is going on.  It certainly looks like holdings are being sold off to generate capital.

**However, I think this is a play by Point72 to get people to jump on the bandwagon and push them them down further, which is exactly what they want.**

In reality, I think it is more likely that Point72 pivoted to puts and are fire selling long positions to drive the price down.  Could they be pissed at the Market Makers for the GME blow up?  Would the MM be left holding the bag for this play? If that's the case, there is excellent smoke screen with the Melvin Backstop ""losses"" and Point72 needing to get more liquid Friday last week.

**I speculate they literally ran one fucking algorithm on every single one of their long positions. It bought PUTS Monday 10:15-10:30am and then it sells off huge volume of shares everyday at 3:45pm.  Selling large volumes of shares into the close to ensure it is low, swing the after/pre markets lower, so its a gap down open and closer to strikes. The small spikes on Monday around 10:30AM could be the Market Makers buying the underlying positions to hedge?**

What do you do? I have no fucking clue. You could try and hitch a ride? This isnt investment advice. Just be careful this is market wide deep pocket shit that I am too smoothbrained to game.  Probably fucked on my non-gme calls.

Many of you probably know this already, but if you're charitably minded you can really maximize your gift by donating APPRECIATED stock directly to charity instead of selling (incurring tax) and gifting cash.

A few fine print items to note:

-Donating stock that you have held for less than a year (short term gain) limits your deduction to your original investment (basis) to the stock. If you have held the stock for long term, you get to deduct the fair market value at the time of the gift. (💎✊)

-Charitable deductions are below-the-line deductions, meaning that you would need to itemize your deductions in order to get proper credit. If you take the standard deduction instead, your maximum deduction is $300.

-Your gains are added to your Adjusted Gross Income. If you do itemize and want to claim deduction you need to understand that your deduction is capped based on your AGI and the type of property you are donating. For cash, you can deduct up to 60% of AGI. For appreciated stock, you can only deduct up to 30% of your AGI. The IRS permits a 5 year carry forward for charitable gifting if you exceed these limits.


None of this is tax or legal advice. I just like the stock.

Trying to figure out how much of this is gamma squeeze vs shorts covering.

As of yesterday, I calculated that $154 was the average short price based on the total number of shares short vs volume held (new shorts are entering as others are closing out, which means the average short price will be going up).

The closer this price is to the actual share price, it would mean many have covered, right now since it's half the share price, I'm inferring most have not covered yet.

Other important price targets are basically the call expirations for 1/29. If the share price is above the strike prices, the more contracts will get executed thus further gamma squeeze.


Edit:
based on data posted here, I'm estimating that about 30M shorts exited, 15M shorts entered, another 5M maybe exited AH so avg short price at $204 with 40M+ short outstanding, 80%+ of float

this is a conservative estimate, meaning actual short interest may be much higher

Because this is what it was : A coordinate cyberattack on Reddit. I think the mods could have a word to say about what happened today. I like to think that if they could file a complaint for cyberattack, this would have a huge impact and help the SEC find who was really manipulating the market here...


Because there was definitely a market manipulation. But not orchestred by Redditors. Look what happened to Nokia stocks : the price doubled in 10 min for no reasons ! And you all know the volume required to move such a beast in only 10 min (6 billions shares outstanding !)! Such a volume in such a short period of time can only be triggered by an institutional actor... And let's not forget AMC, BBY, NAKD etc... just in order to throw smoke at your face... That’s ridiculous... Congrats to those who could make good gains today. 

I am disgusted by the fact that because those short sellers could not face their failure, they decided to attack a public forum, force brokers to stop all trading on GME, and lie on public TV.
 
Let’s be clear here: we do not manipulate the market. We are a public forum where we exchange ideas on stocks and options. Nobody is forced to buy or sell something. Everybody can join and leave whenever he desires to. We are not coordinated nor organized. Each individual is completely independent.

I just wanted to take this out of my chest. 
 
Personally, I will keep GME…. Just because I am little bit retarded and because I like the stock.

1. Create a pinned post and only allow people to post their high quality meme content created around the GME war.

2. When the squeeze is squozen we can seek donations, in the form of our new national currency GME stock, to purchase a physical location with tvs to display these memes.

This liability is secured by the assets in the party's margin account. When the liability exceeds the amount of assets in the margin account, they face a margin call. Provide additional money or securities to cover the gap or we will liquidate your position and bill you for the remainder.

The monumental discovery which is in process is as follows: When over 100% of shares are short, the long position is effectively backed by the shorts, and becomes an infinite loop. If the market cap of a stock is $50Bn, there are $50Bn in margin assets backing this price. Thus stock is in a perpetual state of fair value as long as the over 100% condition holds and the shorts have the assets, regardless of price.

So now the hedge funds find themselves in a Chinese finger trap. To push their fingers together means to liquidate their positions and take enormous losses. To pull their fingers is to continue to provide margin as the price increase until they reach bankruptcy and lose everything. In their hubris, they were trying to pull.

As these funds and brokers employ tons of smart phds to understand this math, they have undoubtedly realized this, and hence they want to cut the trap. They have restricted retail trading to prevent this limitless outflow, they are trying to bully the regulators into backstopping their position, they may halt trading.

What is the maximum fair market cap of GME? It is as much capital as these hedge funds want to throw away, lambs to the slaughter, before they throw in the towel, and its first come first serve. What is the AUM of the remaining short funds, 50Bn? 100Bn? 200Bn? more?

As we have seen time and time again, the behavior of market participants is not rationale and is difficult to predict. People are ignorant of this mathematical fact, crying about the fundamental value of the retailer on CNBC. But big money is smart, they will figure out exactly how big the pot is, and they will snap it up. Even a country could do it.

Disclaimer: I am not a financial professional, nor is this financial advice, I'm just pointing out that there is a fundamental misunderstanding of this financial math. Make your own choices and invest responsibly (only what you can afford to lose). Lord knows they are doing anything they can legal or not to shut this down.

TLDR: The Math of over 100% short interest allows for 100% arbitrage losses from the short funds. This creates the possibility for the greatest transfer of wealth of all time."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165123.csv|StockTicker|['A', 'CNBC']|[]|['GME', 'AUM', 'CNBC', 'I']|['GME']

In this arrival of the meme technical daily, we discuss why $1000 isn’t the ceiling for GME. As you see, we all know the previous resistance levels of $69. Today we just broke the second level of resistance at 420.69. I expected that by tomorrow we will reach we will reach the next minor point of resistance at 696.90. 

Once reached this minor point of resistance, I forecast that the next resident isn’t at $1000 like most people believe. In fact, I forecast something much higher. That level is $1337. 

If we come together and reach that level and diamond hands thru that false glass ceiling, then we will see the full potential of this stock. 

You see, Gme will have so much buying pressure, that my charts forecast a peak of $8008.55. That’s right.

I am not advocating any plays.

Yeah bagholders, shills, and hedge fund bots I know you won't like this post but shut the fuck up and Ill try to save you some money and explain the bullshit as to why this stock has been shilled. Out of random this stock gets pumped up by new accounts saying its the next short squeeze. Lets take a look at it and compare it to the other short squeezes, $GME and $AMC.

# Short Interest (SI) Potential

Its no secret now why some weird market forces are acting on $GME and $AMC because of forced buying due to a short squeeze. In order to trigger a short squeeze you need huge short positions to trigger the forced buying after a price increase. If you need more than that to know what i mean look up a youtube video im not gonna hold your hand, put your big boy pants and learn it yourself smooth brain. GME has the retardedly high level of 140% (which is illegal) causing insane forced buying spiking it 6,700% from its pre-squeeze levels [source](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME). $AMC has about 37% SI and has squeezed about 500% since pre squeeze level [source](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC&ty=c&ta=1&p=d). Those market forces that caused those movements are not present in $NOK. **$NOK has a paltry, pitiful, incredibly low SI of 0.94%**[source](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=nok&ty=c&ta=1&p=d) **!** There won't be that forced buying pressure from shorts being forced to close out.

# Gamma Squeeze potential

Okay you're still not convinced whatever fuck you read this too. If you don't know what a gamma squeeze look that shit up it isn't that hard to grasp and i'm not you dad so teach yourself. Today an insane amount of call options traded on them, sure, but that won't affect the price much. All call option open interest is 934,240 at close, which is just 93M shares worth underlying. Even if MM's are forced to buy shares because they are selling naked there are **5.6B shares outstanding on NOK.** Even if all those calls are naked (most probably aren't) then that's only 93,424,000 shares they have to purchase which is about 1.5% of shares outstanding [source](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/NOK/options) if you look at the 1/29 call options. They could close those out so quickly and at no real price increase because there's no forced buying from shorts.

# Daily Volume

Okay bag holder you're impressed they traded over 1B shares today which is a record for NOK. That matters less than your basketball games did to your dad. That 1B share volume is less than 20% than shares outstanding, but today GME did 150% and AMC did 1200% so its nowhere even close in relative trading volume to the big boys. 1B seems big but it really aint in this context.

# Valuation

Yeah some of you have no idea what i said above and may never but before you go back to drooling on your keyboard lets take a look at valuations real quick. Before GME squeezed it had a Market cap of about 300M, and AMC had Market Cap of 600M. NOK is sitting at a 35B Market cap right now, it is many many magnitudes larger than those two. its not a small cap fallen from grace it is still a large cap stock. A large cap stock is a stock over 10B is it is 3.5x the minimum of a large cap, not punt GME or AMC.

# ""Its a 5G play""

yeah sure it is to some point, but the market knows everything about it already. It didn't come out with a new product, service, get a new PT or anything else. Its not 50% better than it was a few days ago on now news. Sure it may have been relatively undervalued but it went up 40% today and nothing is new. Im not saying it’s a dead company either just that it’s worth 35 fucking billion dollars already 

# Summary

This isn't a stock to buy to punish the hedge funds. All your calls are doing is handing free premium money to them and buying their shares at insane valuations.

# What do I think it is?

Who the fuck knows why so many pumpers are out there on this stock. Maybe some are hedge fund bots, maybe they have a record number of bagholders, maybe its people who love buying on the ""greater fool theory"". I don't know but what i do know is that its not the rocket ship a bunch of virgins are saying it is. All you're doing is buying hedge fund douchebag their 3rd wife's boob job and a new yacht to fuck them in.

Edit: why post this? Pumping and dumping stocks like this is gonna cause this place to get a bad name for manipulating stuff on no news or market analysis

Edit 2: If you still think you’re fighting the institutions, please look at institutional ownership. It’s at 4.7%, more than 4x the short interest. Pumping it only helps the hedge funds not hurts them it’s counter intuitive to what people claim. You’re getting pump and dumped on

Edit 3: fuck robinhood for stopping trading on $NOK.

But the big question is: how is GME shorted more than 100% of shares outstanding in the first place?

The answer to this is [naked short selling](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp) which has been illegal since 2008. The hedge funds such as Melvin Capital among others have been engaging in illegal activities and should be the ones who are prosecuted by the SEC.

Spread the word and control the narrative. We are not the root problem to this clusterfuck and it is time for the boomers at Wall Street to pay the fuck up for their illegal activities because we retards like the stock.

We need to find an acquisition target right now and push for the board to make the purchase. Lord knows, we may own enough shares to make the case. This would be a fucking nightmare for anyone short this stock and ***more importantly may prevent anyone from ever being a bag holder.***

Martket cap is currently at $25B. WHO SHOULD WE BUY?

*\*\*\*Edit: Yes I know Gamestop is not literally a blank check company, but it could potentially acquire a target in exchange for shares.

I'm a Finance MBA and I just want to say my thoughts on this whole GameStop issue.  what you are doing by forcing the investment brokerages an algo Traders to cover the short positions driving the stock of GameStop up as essentially a revolt against the  hedge funds and fund managers is not only a big f\*\*\* you middle finger to the irregularity and craziness  of  the Wall Street Stock Market,  it is also a big bonus to any GameStop associate that was working as a wage slave for years that decided to take stock as part of their compensation over all these years and allowing them to finally retire.  The unfortunate side of this is that the executives at GameStop that benefit from the options that they hold will also walk out rich as crap.  now I'm not one to encourage stock manipulation but I sincerely hope that this run-on GameStop ends prior to the vesting of the options of the executive team so they are not eligible to benefit from the craziness, only the associates they got screwed over in the early 2000s working for a dying company paying $0.25 for your copy of Halo 2.

That's it keeps up the work guys. Just to clarify I don't have any skin in the game I don't hold a financial position in GameStop nor do I intend to take one in the next couple weeks.  I can say that I did hold about 10 LEAP, bought in April last year, $5 January 15 calls on GameStop.  so why can't you guys have done this a couple weeks ago?

PS I guess Michael Burry was right with GameStop in his portfolio the guy long game all of it again.

Before the New Year I wrote an Article that I posted on my blog on Seeking Alpha. I wanted to share a portion that I wrote on Silver from it. This was written and published on 1/3/21. So it is a few weeks old but I believe the analysis is still valid. 

&#x200B;

I believe this is only the beginning of SLV’s upside. SLV is a very straight forward way to play the silver market which is why I am such a big fan. The trust itself holds Silver in a .50% expense ratio to it’s current AUM currently holding 555,000,000 ounces of silver to its $14 billion AUM. It is also the most active and liquid of all silver positions one could hold which helps make SLV the easiest of all Silver ETF’s and positions one could hold. 

Another reason I currently love this ETF is the way in which Silver tends to trade. Historically speaking Silver tends to be purchased in the months of January, February, August and September a. This trend correlates with SLV’s 2020 high being in August.  

&#x200B;

[Historic Probability of Silver Rises ](https://preview.redd.it/f58l6191c3e61.png?width=310&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1a624ac92fd5394eb3eca686d64884373d41c14)

&#x200B;

The chart above displays a clear trend in silver being bullish in the short term based off the historic probability it will rise in both January and February. Since silver and SLV hit their current all time high this past August and then retreated a bit through the fall, it is likely we will see it not only return to its all time high in January/February but hit a new all time high. 

While the short term case provides a compelling reason to purchase silver. the long term case for silver is even more compelling. From a macroeconomic standpoint there are a few catalysts that should have Silver trend higher. First, the current money supply around the world is at an unprecedented level due to stimulus given out throughout countries to help people cope with the economic loses brought on by Covid-19. Second, the U.S currently is sitting on half the global debt, with the dollar being lower in value and lots of money being printed along with a zero interest policy rate. In this environment, a commodity such as silver or gold will most likely gain in value as it has throughout the past year. The reason for this gain is that over time both gold and silver tend to correct themselves in terms of the global money supply. In the U.S., that money supply is again being increased with another round of stimulus checks. Gold and Silver will follow suit in having another positive correction based off this money supply.

I'm here just to share my experience.I've read articles on short squeeze on Volkwagen and part of the free money TSLA Inclusion of S&P 500.

**1. If you want to be fully part of the squeeze, you should HOLD until the following week. People will be tempted to sell as soon as it's friday because that's the day but that's only the very beginning of the ""End game""**

Why?

Volkwagen Short Squeeze was triggered and lasted two days. The Short Squeeze is very obvious and can be evaluated based off the VWAP and consistent constant large chunks of volume. We have neither seen any of these signs. Assuming all the options are exercised and shorts are planning to execute on Friday, this violent and volatile price action will go on until the next week.

\*\*2. Those institutions and hedge funds shorting? They WILL exercise on Friday but dont count on them doing so until the end of POwer hour (3pm-4pm)?\*\*

Dont believe me? 

Check how Index Funds and MM played the Tesla Inclusion. No suspensions or halts but gigantic sell walls, and FOMO'd a huge bulk of scalpers in the power hour and made them think ""hey...maybe index funds already bought TSLA? Maybe...we should sell..omg we're  screwed""TSLA dropped from 685 to 635 in 10 minutes.What happened next? index funds swooped in and bought all the paper hands selling in unprecedented bulk buys, driving the  price all the way to 665-695.

Expect similar things about GME on Friday. Shorts will cover.They will wait until the last  opportunity to do so using psychological fear tactics. Expect a gigantic s pike at the wee hours of  Friday.

3.  \*\*Hold. Hold. Hold.\*\*

Looking at the charts, it's obvious, the MM are adapting to the situation

.On Monday, they suspended and halted. This did nothing. So they adapted.  
On Tuesday, they suspended/halted AND the shorts doubled down (Melvin's borrow from POint72) to instill fear and get people to sell to drive vicious sell action. People held and bought more, and they realized its futile and prices return to normals yet again.  
On Wednesday, we saw a new strategy. They halted (which did nothing), but we  saw a steady stream of attacks from shorting the stock instead of a gigantic price action. This actually had a bit of an effect to a degree as we did not witness any massive spikes throughout the day.Another strategy we are witnessing is the after hour action.  


On tuesday, we were blessed with Elon Musk liking the stock and the tesla cult joining in also liking the stock. However, without a catalyst, we are witnessing a stead stream of attacks to drive down prices in the after hours (something we havent seen before), as the same attack was consistent across all tickers: GME, AMC, NOK, BB (all the WSB stocks)This is not coincidence.

Solution ?Buy more, hold. Like all the stocks.

\*\*TL;DR. Hold until Monday. Keep buying. Short Squeeze inc.\*\*

This is my personal  opinion, don't treat it as fact, and I'm not a financial advisor so always doing your own research before arriving to any type of conclusion. 

Also years of experience in the stock market made me realize how scummy people like Shitron, and MMs are at manipulating prices to your advantage. You can go fuck yourselves.

[https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/palisades-gold-radio/ted-butler-squeezing-out-the-hqxQ5mOdt02/](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/palisades-gold-radio/ted-butler-squeezing-out-the-hqxQ5mOdt02/)

You think GME squeezed hard? Look what happened to silver half a year ago in July:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3yssvdm7y1e61.png?width=2588&format=png&auto=webp&s=25d4cfa973d57f1f6083affdcecf6b35e4055a7f

That's one of the banks getting squeezed out of silver, having to cover their shorts... and that's just because rich boomers freaked out about financial instability and finally started calling out the Comex on their bullshit, and taking physically delivery of silver... which they don't have.

Now imagine 4 million degenerates buying $SLV, forcing the trust to take delivery of physical silver from the Comex. This isn't GME, who's fair price is maybe around $5 a share. The FAIR price of silver based on the historical gold/silver ratio is almost surely over $50/ounce. This short squeeze will be a fantastic success even if we can take silver to it's fair market value.

And then there's $AG. Because once silver starts moving, $AG is going to go to the fucking moon. 1) it's a leverage play on silver, 2) It's got it's OWN SHORTS TO BE SQUEEZED OUT. At least a 23% short float as of last count: [https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AG.htm](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AG.htm)

**TL;DR: Once this thing gets going, shares and calls of $SLV and $AG will** ***rocket.***

In 2008 I was in the middle of my first enlistment.  My college had been taken care of beforehand, because I'd been accepted into a program at UMass Boston for high school students with above-average grades.  A week after graduating high school I received a degree in psychology and went off to be a Marine.

I remember 2008.  I remember my father's savings being nuked, his portfolio going to zero.  Twenty years in the United States Navy and he'd had his savings completely obliterated because of the collapse that Wall Street caused.  I remember my mother calling me in the middle of the night--I was in Okinawa, Japan at the time--and crying because the savings were gone.  That day I started sending a measly $1,000 a month to my family to take care of bills and keep my siblings fed.  My grandmother's retirement was gone in the blink of an eye but she survived, because she loved her job (she was still working in her 60s at a retirement home).  But she had to get a reverse mortgage to keep the house.  I didn't have to send money too long--only about five months--until my father got a better job, and my mother was able to get her own job as well.  But I remember the desperation in her voice.

I'm 34 now.  I've done my time in the military.  No pension, I didn't serve long enough.  But now I can look at this entire debacle and fucking laugh.  I'm a capitalist at heart.  I support being paid for your services.  But I remember the bullshit you engaged in, and I know many others do as well.  Occupy Wall Street did fuck all to you.  But now the internet has given way to arguably the worst thing for you: actual communication and planning.  Now you're seeing what a group of people who loathe everything you stand for can do to you in days.  You won't learn from it, though, which is okay.  This may not keep happening, but every time you decide to attempt something like this the fear will be there, in the back of your mind.  I wish I could have gotten in on this.  I'm not able to spend money like many of these people can.  But I hope it hurts, and it seems like it is.

And there should be no mercy in a situation like this.  Hound them until they concede.  And always remember the motto of the Marine Corps, ""Semper fidelis""--Always Faithful."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165125.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'A', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']|[]

Bank operatives are constantly spoofing prices and suppressing metals' true value. They get off with tiny fines and huge profits on naked shorts, and they should be tasting their own medicine (see links below). They can do this because the amount of paper silver is hugely inflated (x100 the physical).  Pressure on the price will force them to deliver silver bullions that they don't actually have. This could be a catalyst for a massive melt-up of silver ETF prices and mines. Banks won't be able to cover their naked shorts on the futures they're trading and they will have to deliver Silver they don't have. Seeing as how the paper market is estimated to be 100x large, you can see where I'm going. It's been [suggested](https://www.adamseconomics.com/post/the-undeniable-manipulation-of-the-silver-market) that this cycle can explode in their faces with a 'moon shot' of Silver price rising, but never was this more possible than now.

This could be the real occupy wall street, this will hurt them where they'll feel it. We're tired of suits manipulating our lives. Hedgies were first, now corrupt banks will have their reckoning. This is more than a meme, this is duty.

What if TSLA bought out GME at 420.69? TSLA can finance the deal in all-stock with a $29 billion price tag. 

Why do this?

1. TSLA would have to find some synergies with GME. Maybe use their retail locations as information centers for selling their cars. 
2. He can spin this off as a publicity move to “bail-out” the little guy and stand against blatant market manipulation. Remember, S Elon’s C. 
3. $29b is just 3.6% of TSLA market cap.

It seems that the general demographic of Reddit is a bunch of computer nerd freaks who love gaming. Am I wrong? That’s the truth. DFV is a true geek, one of the greatest value investors the world has ever seen and it’s fucked that he will not get any credit for his in depth analysis. I mean look at his YT channel. He has been streaming for hours on end for past 6 months. 

DFV realized that GameStop was being shorted into fucking bankruptcy. This is important, because REDDIT is a bunch of GAMER FREAKS who love GameStop. Why would we let a giant hedge fund drive this stock into bankruptcy? We love to game?????? It’s not market manipulation its value investing for a company that WE LOVE. 


I don’t hold any positions, but I have loved every second of this frenzy.

So here are the questions.

&#x200B;

1. What can I do about this on a political level? I saw lots of people saying to contact your local congressperson but I'm not sure how it works in my country, I am scottish.
2. What are my other options? I looked into a bunch of other ones but apparently they all are blocking buys OR are blocked in my country. I looked up Fedility but it asks me to make payments up-front?
3. What can i do on a legal level? Is there any class action lawsuit I can join in against Trading212?

I really think it'd be a good chance for all the new people to practice before they dip their feet into the water.

&#x200B;

Second, there so much misinformation being shit all over the internet right now about how we caused this squeeze on $GME, and of course everybody here is happy to take credit. The reality is we didn't do shit.

First off retards, go look at the open interest here: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain)

&#x200B;

You'll notice as of about 2PM EST there's about 125,000 call options in open interest.

Contracts are 100 per

125,000 \* 100 = 12,500,000 shares under option long

Let's assume all are delta 1 (a few of of you will know what that means). A dealer would need to own 12,500,000 to write ALL call options outstanding right now... No this doesn't mean we were 12.5m shares of volume...

&#x200B;

There's about 56k puts (let's assume 0 delta just to prove a point). We know the negative delta balances out the positive delta for writers, but again, just to prove a point, let's assume it's 0!

&#x200B;

Even IF we assume the puts are not apart of the equation (they are). Options dealers are not needing to buy into the market on a massive scale to delta hedge... just look at the volume...

&#x200B;

Even on a $100 move probably on a couple million shares MAXIMUM would need to be traded to get the delta hedger to delta neutral.

&#x200B;

Also my sister texted me today asking me how to buy the GameStop stock and she doesn't even know what present value is. So if that's not a sign we're at a top, I'm not sure what is.

Haven't put on my pride flag since I bought puts before Covid, but I'm thinking it might be time again soon.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** *We didn't do shit. We're basically a fly on the colosseum floor flying around the dead body of Melvin Capital taking credit for the kill after it was stabbed to death in brutal combat by another group of financial institutions.*

[Oh and yes I cashed out on my bets against old folks homes from Covid like a true autist and took my tendies (been a while since I've posted here).](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgmxeb/this_isnt_over_not_by_a_long_shot_this_is_the/)

More hedge funds are being hit by losses on the recent market turmoil.

Traders say the pain that has afflicted top hedge funds Melvin Capital Management and Maplelane Capital in recent days is spreading, as an increasing number of stocks with significant short interest surge and as funds dealing with losses pull back their exposure to the stock market on both the long and short sides of their portfolios.

That means funds are getting hurt even on previously profitable bets on companies as those share prices fall.

Candlestick Capital Management, a roughly $3 billion Greenwich, Conn., hedge fund started by former Citadel portfolio manager Jack Woodruff, was down in the low-to-mid-teens for the year through Wednesday, said a person familiar with the fund. It was up 26% in 2020, its first year.

D1 Capital Partners, a top-performing fund in recent years founded by former Viking Global investment chief Dan Sundheim, was down about 20% for the year through Wednesday. Its substantial portfolio of investments in private companies has buffered the fund from a bigger loss. D1 managed $20 billion at the start of the year.

Steven A. Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management, which together with Citadel and its partners injected $2.5 billion in emergency financing into Melvin Monday, was down about 10% for the year through earlier this week and suffered losses Tuesday and Wednesday, said people familiar with the matter.

Bloomberg News was first to report the performances of D1 Capital and Point72.

Some funds that have sustained severe losses are seeking influxes of cash to help stabilize their firms.

Maplelane, which started the year with about $3.5 billion and was down roughly 30% for the year through Tuesday, sustained additional losses that saw it down about 45% for the year through Wednesday, said people familiar with the fund. One of the people said the losses Wednesday stemmed from degrossing, or cutting back its exposure to the stock market. That included reducing position sizes and exiting names to limit losses.

Maplelane is a low-profile hedge fund that has rarely marketed to investors in the past. But it has discussed raising between $300 million and $500 million with potential clients, said people familiar with the fund.

The losses have come during a period of frenetic trading, with shares of companies such as GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. shooting wildly higher. Individual investors have claimed victory for the violent moves unmoored from the underlying fundamentals of companies. The rising prices have prompted bearish investors to buy back shares they had sold short to cut their losses, pushing the stock higher still.

This is a liquidity play. Do not let people tell you otherwise.


Every interview I see on the news is trying to divert the conversation towards the central question of '...but do you see any fundamental value here?'. This is classic misdirection. Even by extremely bullish estimates, we are probably trading over the 'true' fundamental value of the stock. This fact is not lost on anybody here. But by fixing the conversation to 'fundamentals', the media is trying to frame a story where there is NO OTHER 'right' way of trading stocks. 


What about technical traders who purely look for demand-supply levels as well as technical indicators such as Fib levels, Elliot cycles, etc?


What about algorithmic traders who rely on maximizing profits from micro-movements in stocks?


What about scalpers? Swing traders? Day-traders? Momentum-investors?


And perhaps most relevant of all - what about liquidity-based traders who find stocks that are over-shorted by greedy hedge funds and decide to teach them a lesson by locking in shares, forcing the funds to buy them back at exorbitant prices? 


Don't let people trick you into selling your positions because the stock is trading over its 'fundamental value'. That's NOT what this is about. That's just the media reframing the story to make retail investors look bad and misinformed. 


Also, where were the fundamentals when the stock was trading at $3? Weren't most analyst predictions higher than this price point? Why did it suddenly become so relevant?


Media and brokerages are not there to look out for you - they're answerable only to their shareholders and couldn't care less if you made or lost money. Exercise caution while listening to what they say. I'm not saying everyone out there is a greedy bastard (I'd pay to shine Chadmath's shoes). Just ensure that you're well-informed and not being manipulated.

I am so thankful for each and every member here. That aside, what we are witnessing today is unlike any screwing the little man has ever received from MMs, Brokers, and billionaires before. The hypocrisy of Robinhood, TD, and the like is unreal. During the initial COVID crash, where were these brokers to look out for poor retail investors? Was there any restriction on selling stocks? Did Robinhood or other brokers announce, ""For your own safety we are restricting all selling. Investors can only open up new positions until volatility passes.""? HELL NO! Instead, we were force fed all the fear in the world from the likes of people like Bill ""Hell is Coming"" Ackman and other talking heads. When Ackman does blatant market manipulation like the hell is coming speech, fellow millionaires, ""haves"" and others look the other way. If you're a hedge fund market manipulation is just a way of life.

&#x200B;

When everday Joe Blows come together on a subbredit to talk stocks and actually start winning for once, now its time for change? I can't get over the fact that its only at this point in time, when hedgefunds, banks, and market makers MIGHT lose some money that they scream regulation. Ironic how that works out huh? Also ironic how not one media source or suit ever makes mention of the fact that depending on what source you read short interest in GME is between 138%-250%. Blatantly illegal. No mention that MMs or brokers should be punished for that though. The fine men and women here notice and share some DD about buying GME and now we need to be punished? For winning the game? For beating the MMS and the suits at their own game? 

&#x200B;

I'm sure this comes off to some as just a bunch of whining. I'm sure Boomers and the like will take a victory lap today, saying ""See! The fundamentals win out in the end!"" We all know going into this that the hand is stacked in favor of the MMs and the suits. Now they've decided that in playing the game we should be dealt have the number of cards to play too. This has morphed into so much more now than just making money. This is a social movement now. For everyone that has ever had a dream of making it big trading. For everyone that loves being part of a community to share ideas, joys, and hardships. For everyone that wants freedom above all else. 

We do not need ""protecting"" by the MMs, brokers, and suits. My friends, now is the time to band together and stand up for ourselves. Its always darkest before the dawn. Do not sell, do not submit, and never give up.  The talking heads will point and laugh tonight. The justification will be that we are all too damn stupid to know whats best for us. They will count on all calls expiring worthless tomorrow. They will count on tomorrow being the greatest transfer of wealth back from us to the MMs and just mark this up as a another blip on the books for a bubble. Don't let them win. Hold firm, Hold strong, and by tomorrow's market close we will show all of them that we can make a difference, we are a force to be reckoned with, and we will not back down.

Mods, please don't delete this. I think it's important that we share useful information in this time when we have been taken advantage of by Robinhood and their cronies. With that said, I've been using TD Ameritrade lately and I absolutely love it. It's a big boy broker unlike Robinhood, and they actually have customer service we could call and complain to if they were ever to do something so stupid like blocking us from trading a stock. This isn't financial advice. I'm not affiliated with TD Ameritrade. I just want to put the word out there that this $GME fight isn't over and we certainly don't have to lose.

&#x200B;

For those commenting that TD Ameritrade blocked $GME Trading, that's false. They didn't! I believe they blocked purchasing $GME on margin. But you can still buy $GME through TD Ameritrade. I upped my $GME position on TD Ameritrade today.

Before you autists get all frothy at me, I'm not telling anyone to give up their 💎🙌. The beauty of stocks is that you can own more than one.

AMC opened today at 4x the price, after trending up for days. It bounced around half its ATH of $35, before closing at 300% gain for the day.

GME hit $380 today, up six times its all time high of $63. The current GME price scares away non-autist retail investors, and at that price, new buyers will be expending multiples more capital for the same upward pressure.

If you don't believe me, look at the numbers. As GME is hitting mainstream and is the big hotness on this sub, AMC also outperformed GME by 165% by close today.

Also, #saveAMC is already trending as it gains traction across social media. People are actively looking for a new GME they feel they missed the boat on.

https://www.thestreet.com/investing/amc-shares-outerspace

https://twitter.com/reddittrading/status/1354479260363354117

Despite how low the price already was, it has a record number of shorts: over 38 million. This means another short squeeze isn't just on the menu - it's already starting. It's the third most shorted stock out there, despite its clearly viable future. This doesn't distract from GME's slaughter of hedge funds because it's the next wave of their an hero.

AMC has raised a billion dollars to weather out coronavirus, amid an ongoing ""Safe & Clean"" push. Some studios like WB are moving to parallel releases on HBO Max, but AMC is already throwing out deals to get people in the door. Meanwhile, Hollywood has been sitting on blockbusters after watching Tenet and WW1984 eat shit on streaming:

https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean

https://screenrant.com/tenet-box-office-failure-warner-bros-2021-movies-impact/

Their debt/equity ratio has also been trending positively, even as coronavirus has intensified. Just a return to the mean suggests ridiculous gain, even ignoring the likelihood of pent-up demand. AMC has legs not just for the next week, but for the next few quarters.

https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMC/amc-entertainment-holdings/debt-equity-ratio

Coronavirus, the main cause for AMC's big downturn, is on the way out as vaccines will be available to all by spring, just ahead of summer blockbuster season.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-biden-anyone-spring/

In the long term, after hedge fund shorters lose their ass on GME, brick and mortar game stores will have less of a future, with or without coronavirus. It's easier to digitally download games, and hardware can be bought online and received the next day from any number of retailers. There's no way to mount a 20 foot screen in your house. Unless, of course, you buy AMC stock now.

But maybe after we hit 420, 888, 1K, 5K, 10K a share, some autists may want to cash out a few of those tendies to spend on a selfless cause. 

Can we find a way to work out a transparent way—to match buyers and sellers—who want to tell us how the money may be used to help a loved one, pay of debt, or give back in a different way. 

This approach could help soften the impact of short sellers looking to cascade in the market, plus let people know that this community is about way more than “just the money”

Just an idea, happy to hear what people think.

Update: Idea below “We could potentially create a large pool of money from a reputable mod dispersed amongst a voted slew of several foundations/ causes. Could be phenomenal press in our behalf’s.”

I am your local commie cuckmaster the Gay Bear! And I have important bullshit for you to hate me for.

But first things first. Good job with GME! Those bastards at Melvin and Citron don't deserve the title of Gay Bear. They spew lies and spread propaganda in order to decimate companies, and now it looks like GameStop is on the way to completely revolutionize their business model all thanks to you!

Now back to my commie bullshit.

While you autists have been hyperfixated on GME, the rest of the market decided to take a dump. SPY broke a bound it's been holding on to since last November. Also, the Pring's Special K indicator is closely approaching a lower bound. If you don't trust this indicator, I can assure you that I have done lots of Special K (the hose tranquilizing kind) when a flying midget told me that I can trust it. 

Now that you know it's real, it's time to wildly speculate on why the market would react like this. First of all, if anyone hates commies  more than you, it's hedge fund managers and market movers. They think that communism is when the government takes away their money and gives it to ingrates like you. What a bunch of idiots. 

Now that they think you're basically worse than china, they would rather bring down the whole system out of spite than to acknowledge that you've won.

Also, remember that the orange haired troll printed off money wherever his micropenis pointed to, and now the senile hair sniffer is worried about something called a ""deficit"" whatever the fuck that is. 

So with that, if SPY doesn't recover tomorrow I'm going to drop whatever I've been holding on to and go balls deep on GME, BB, and AMC calls.

https://www.barrons.com/articles/another-gamestop-here-are-the-next-10-most-shorted-small-caps-51611688092

Dillard's is currently sitting at a short percent of float of 146.36% and will be substantially higher after todays price action.

https://www.gurufocus.com/term/FloatPercentageOfTSO/DDS/Float-Percentage-Of-Total-Shares-Outstanding/Dillard

Dillard's $DDS share float is only 4.24 million or 19.26%. What this means is every dollar thrown at Dillard's will affect its price 5x more then a stock with a 100% outstanding float.

The lower the float the easier it is to moon.

Look at this mornings price action. DDS ran 20% to $128 on 240k of volume before being halted and shorted back down. If this stock gets any attention it will run faster than my dad from his parental duties.

Look at the after hours activity. It ran from $82-$93 on 400 shares. That's the type of moon possibility we are dealing with. Any volume premarket can send this up 50%+.

Worst case scenario and it doesn't squeeze you are invested in a company that trimmed its fat and improved its margins thanks to covid. Reporting 32 million in net income last quarter up from 5.5million in the prior year.

This post will probably get downvoted to oblivion thanks to the GME stampede but ill keep it up for reference once DDS moons.

This is guaranteed to give Lowe’s and Home Depot wayyy more cash to grow and innovate their supply chain and e-commerce platforms. Attract talent from Silicon Valley. They will also increase their dividends. 

Not to mention they will receive all the customers who are refinancing right now to pull cash out to take advantage of TAX CREDITS for purchasing MADE IN AMERICA insulation, windows, doors, appliances, tiles, flooring. Who wants to pay taxes when the government is giving you free money to upgrade your house to the latest energy efficient technology.

I don’t have Home Depot as I see the growth opportunity a bit less with them being the market leader. But I think the 300 calls for March are great.

Now SEC is investigating, brokers are disallowing buying more calls. This is the institutions flat out admitting they will change the rules to bail out the rich but if it happens to us, we get a “well shucks you should have known investing is risky! have you tried cutting out avocados and coffee, maybe doing Uber on the side?”

We may have collectively driven up enough sentiment in wall street to make other big players go long on GME with us (we do not have the money to move the stock as much as it did alone). we didn’t hurt wall street as a whole, just a few funds went down while others went up and profited off the shorts the same as us. The media wants to pin the blame on us.

It should be crystal clear that this is a rigged game by now. Its time to build new exchanges that can’t arbitrarily change the rules on us. Cr\*\*o has some version of these, maybe they can be repurposed to be trade stock without government intervention. I don’t know exactly what it will look like yet, but the broad next steps i see are - 1. exit the current financial system 2. build a new one."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165135.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['CEO', 'ASDAQ', 'SEC', 'GME', 'I']|['CEO', 'GME']

Everyone is here for the squeeze. Not because GameStop is all of a sudden a good company. So let’s say we accomplish this anarchist goal of destroying Melvin Capital. I love that. But then what? Who is holding the bag? Thousands of poor retail investors that we all told to HOLD THE LINE while the smarter (or dumber based on your perspective) people in WSB sell. 

Everyone needs to take a hard look at what’s going on here. We are blaming Robinhood and SEC, but they don’t want people to get FUCKED out of their mind. Melvin capital can eat a dick. But a lot of people here are going to be eating a dick right alongside Melvin. 

Whatever comes from this, just remember that this situation hurts thousands of people who probably can’t afford to lose the money because they saw Mia Khalifa tweeting and don’t know any better. We created this animal, we gotta take responsibility to.

This shit was straight up fucking mind blowing.  Huge rockets in the short term, huge rockets in the long term as they slowly take over the planet.  Adopt or die.  Make sure to own your piece everyone.

I think we all know that $GME and the short squeeze wave has been the play right now, but make sure not to sleep on this unbelievable event.  Thiel and Karp are the messiahs and they're taking us straight to the fucking moon while Elon figures out our trip to Mars via an Earth-splitting SpaceX IPO.

PT: $50 by EoM / EoFebruary; $75-100 if we manage to  💎🙌 like men.

TL;DR - Accumulate PLTR or wonder what if while the wifes bf takes her on another trip with his $PLTR gains.

Positions: 1,950 @ $25 (few feb/march/may puts for increased buying power; december positions expired roughly at breakeven) and 1x $20C for 1/21/23 because I had some extra last week.  Things already doubled.  See you on the Martian Riviera boys.

GME reaches 2000$/share, or 42069$/shares. And then what? Most of you will have made a killing. Some of you will be millionaires. But you are going to be millionaires on the screen.  


Once Melvin is dead, the shorts will have to sell their shorts to have bread in the evening and all options are ITM, then what? The trade is crowded and nobody is (short) selling. And suddenly nobody is buying. And then contrarian liquidity will cease to exist. And huge disruptions with order flows are likely to happen. We saw that to a non-negligible degree yesterday, we are seeing it today. And it's going to get worse.   


GME is going to be worth gazillions on paper but you probably won't be able to sell until the price is much much lower. The liquidity cost most of you are going to incur is something you can't imagine right now and that the stock price on the monitor is and will be hiding. Some of you will have made the kind of fuck you money that allows you to live carefreely. Many of you will be left holding the bag.  


I've been a fellow autist, mostly lurking, for over 5 years. Fuck Melvin, CNBC, and THEIR market manipulation. Long live WSB.

Paper hands bailing out at the first sign of trouble and causing our wall to falter is at the top of my list. That dip back into the double digits a few days ago had people shook. 

Regulatory intervention? Not really afraid of that, this should hopefully be over before the speed of government does anything. 

Some sort of surprise news? If the open short percentage was shown to be dramatically decreased, that could cause a run for the exits. GME could also make a statement of some sort and rock the boat. 

Robinhood fuckery? That 1/29 options business is odd as hell.

My apologies for not having the time to respond to some of the commentary - I will try to do some of that if I can later today. I was happy to see that our prediction that some companies might monetize their short squeeze with a secondary offering indeed came to pass with AMC.  Hopefully, GME will capitalize on this unusual opportunity - but even without any financing activity, the free publicity for GME from this event, along with inevitably increased sales, will likely leave the companies stock higher for the long run, perhaps significantly higher than from where it started.

It makes me happy to see that we were correct in suggesting GME would continue to move up, ""perhaps substantially so"", which indeed it did.  Unfortunately, my fund only had a very small long position in GME, and we have since liquidated this after seeing it over double.

Now what I'm going to say now will probably prove very unpopular on this forum, and it is being said not to offend anyone but simply to state the fact.  GME's current stock price is divorced from reality and will ultimately collapse down, perhaps substantially so from current levels.  Now I'm not saying anyone should short this stock - that's a fool's errand.  Nor should options like long short-term puts be used to bet this will occur.  Option implied volatility for this issue would make it more likely you will loss money on any such bet.  This is because the squeeze here is largely over.  Massive forced buying of GME has occurred from many funds, that were backed up against margin requirements and needed to preserve liquidity and cover.  The overall loss in both the S&P and DJIA yesterday only exacerbated the need for many funds to cover their short positions. Run-ups in many heavily short issues (like GWPH) occurred yesterday as long-short hedge funds were forced to both sell their longs and simultaneously cover their shorts in an attempt to avoid the fate of Melvin capital and the bleak alternatives of either bankruptcy or begging for garage sale dilutive capital infusions in order to avoid a total loss.

This sequence of forced buying has largely already played out, both for GME and for many other similar companies like BB.  Now I have no idea where GME will be today, tomorrow or even a month from now - but ultimately it will fall from today's artificially elevated values. It is impossible to know when this collapse will occur, but this is essentially a certainty.  The point I'm making here is simple: If you have profits in this company, or others that have recently participated in the near marketwise epic short squeeze, you should take them and probably do so quickly.  This is your change to profit from the many long-short hedge funds who have been given a real beat-down from this epic retain investor phenom. Once the collapse in valuations occurs here, it is very unlikely a repeat of the recent action will occur - at least for the recently squeezed companies.  So get out, take your profits and, at least for now, park the profits in a profitable company with a reasonable valuation and future growth prospects - like APPL which, for full disclosure,  we have a very large long position in.

They have collectively blocked any purchases of these stocks.

They just used their institutional power to end this and no matter what their actual intent may be, to everyone out here it will look like the rich just told the non-rich in very very clear terms that they do not give one shit about what we want.  They will lie, cheat, steal, and use their institutional power to block our opportunities to compete and the whole fucking system including politicians and media will not say a single thing about those abuses except to gaslight us about it.

This right here is why people wanted Trump (I'm a liberal).  They see that the system is rigged against us and they decided they wanted change even if it meant burning everything down.

My DD. (I dont even know what DD is)

Background: ICLN is an etf of clean and green energy stocks. ICLN is invested in PLUG, RUN, and ENPH, just to name a few. 

&#x200B;

The middle shit of an essay (idk I'm special ed): My price target for ICLN is 100 ez. And that's conservative. Now plug is ez valued at 1 trillion dollars it just that boomers take time to realize it. But we are smart people. Anyways once people realize Plugs true form, they buy. buy = price up. PLug price up = icln price up. Now why not just yolo plug? cause that's gay as hell.

One of the stated goals you guys have allready achieved by crushing Malvin Capital beneath your boot.

Historically, doing this was the game of big capital investors, the world bank and western 'development' funds like the IWF. These caste of leeches to the productive capabilities of regular working people have mostly not even done this for the gains of the western industrialised nations, but themselves and their cronies.

The story of how George Soros bet against the pound and forced the Europeans to give up the price binding of the british currency is legion and taught in basic economics classes today.

Those kinds of schemes have only been possible with the combined effort of few big investors that would then not just cash in on their heists, but force the peoples of the world to do their bidding.

What if...

the peoples would bet against the dollar to take away the financial capacity of Wall Street to scam the whole world, while providing the american workers a devalued currency that makes it more attractive to actually produce goods and services in the US for the international market?

the peoples would bet on bonds of nations that got screwed over by huge investment banks and literally got forced to sell their assets for a fraction of their worth?

the peoples would keep on betting against rich institutional investors, just because?

the peoples don't like the face of a new national leader and bet against his country with the expressed purpose of pushing him or her out of office?

With GME the memes are great, but there is still one institutional investor that wins big. That is Black Rock.

But what if, with the collectivised autism of the interwebs, it would be possible to change the game, forever?"|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165138.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'IWF', 'US', 'GME']|['GME']

He starved to death in hospice care because of a brain tumor that made it difficult for him to understand what was going on and due to the pandemic the hospital was unwilling to operate.  


Now his Kodak stuff is my Kodak stuff.  My father and every father who lived in the Rochester, NY area was told that if they got a job with Kodak they could work their way up and be a middle class success.  The area's economy was based around the yearly ""Kodak bonuses"" where employees would get checks in the thousands as an extra reward for their good work.  This is when families would get new cars, new living room sets, maybe that vacation to Disney that they always wanted.  


Kodak was the first to create digital photographs, but never sought to develop the technology further.  They knew that if the technology was developed it would mean the end of their film business which was massive at the time.  From the 80s onward, Kodak downsized and rightsized and did all these different sizings that left families in the dust.  Kodak bonuses disappeared over time and all my dad would talk about at the dinner table was trying to transfer within the company to avoid the next batch of layoffs.  


Kodak went bankrupt a couple years ago.  The market saw that there was blood in the water and when Kodak tried to sell some of its assets to bring in the income it needed to stay afloat the market refused.  After all those same assets will be a lot cheaper from a bankrupt company forced to sell than a non-bankrupt one.  My father was one of the lucky ones.  He transferred to a division within Kodak that ultimately got sold off as Kodak Alaris.  They're the company that makes the Kodak kiosk machines for printing within stores.  


Kodak was most recently in the news because of a deal with the Trump administration to manufacture pharmaceuticals.  Kodak has huge experience with chemicals from their photo business and has a large amount of manufacturing space that has been mothballed since the death of film.  That deal was put on hold due to suspicious stock transactions (market manipulation/insider trading), but Kodak was found to not have engaged in any illegal activity.  


I think Kodak is a promising company.  It helped build my community.  There are thousands of people in the area who have experience and training, but are stuck in subpar jobs since the Kodak collapse hoping that it returns to prominence.  We have 5 colleges in the area including a state of the art medical center that is university affiliated that can provide the medical expertise needed to help this transition process.  People just need to see Kodak as valuable again.  And if their stock started rising again I believe we would see a wave of positivity for all things Kodak and Kodak-related.  


I can provide proof for everything I've talked about.  Here is a picture of my shelf with my father's Kodak clock (which he received after working at Kodak for so many years) as well as some antique cameras I own.

DOW is down. SPY is down. A ton of stocks are falling right now despite the pandemic coming close to an end. The vaccine’s actually getting rolled out, and the DOW dropped 600 points. I’m worried that casual investors are selling everything to go all-in on meme stocks. The media’s been describing them as a runaway train, so people who never actively traded stocks before are going all in. They’re selling every other stock they own at whatever price they can get because the gains are so alluring. This isn’t normal, none of this is normal! What Citron’s did, and what we’re doing, isn’t normal. Once this is over, and the shorts stop coming, and that will be left is a heavily inflated stock due for a hard correction. I’m confident in GameStop’s ability to rebrand themselves, especially with all this new capital, but they aren’t a $400 stock yet, or even a $40 stock. Maybe it can get slowed down if enough people hold, but the ride back down’s gonna be rough. A lot of people who had no idea what they were doing are gonna lose a lot of money. What’s the future going to look like?

EDIT: I’ve given this a second pass, and while GME is definitely drawing interest from other stocks, a lot of these sales show the signs of liquidation. Short sellers probably had to cash out in order to pay off their naked GME shorts, which drove a panic selloff and created an actual dip. Listen, if you’re too afraid to buy GME, then you’d better be buying everything else. Buy these stocks. Buy them as they’re falling so the hedge funds can’t just pay their way back in. Squeeze those lemons until you see blood.

I’m stupid as fuck and totally expect to be ripped apart and for y’all to run a train on my wife. But here goes.
The theory that this bubble is different from other bubbles comes from the idea that, instead of retail investors holding the bag yet again, the real bag holders are the short sellers. But will they be forced to cover?
Here’s why they might not have to:   

1) they have huge amounts of funds, including a trillion dollar lifeline from The Citadel. They can stay retarded and at a loss longer than you can stay exuberant.

2) short selling might not cause much of a squeeze. A short squeeze relies on there being more demand for stocks than supply. But GameStop is so heavily traded, that more than 100% of the float is traded every. Single. Day.

3) the smart money isn’t just in shorts. GameStop insiders own over a billion dollars worth of stock. Organizations are buying stock when their call options become ITM. There may be smart money going long the stock hoping to take a profit before y’all can.

4) Institutional investors can change the rules. They can cease trading completely on these stocks. Or, well meaning brokers can stop you from buying through their apps, which is already happening. They could arrest u/deepfuckingvalue to kill moral. They could kill this subreddit. All of these things would cause a panic and end the bubble.

5) for many of you this is your first time buying stocks. This isn’t smart money’s first rodeo. They are smarter and more emotionally and financially equipped for this situation.

6) This stock has benefited from escalating levels of exuberance. We may have just peaked our exuberance as this has gone fully mainstream. Everyone knows about it, and everyone who wants in on it will be in within the next few days. That isn’t a long time for short sellers to wait. At that point, the  ability to drive prices up further will be very limited.

7) GameStop could issue more stock.

Alright, I’m ready to be killed now.
I love you all and hope you take every fucking penny from the hedge funds and market manipulators.

You heard it. 0 losses 7 wins. This will be last big one before taking a break.

What if I told you there was a company almost delisted from the NASDAQ because the company hasn’t been able to maintain the 1 dollar share price to stay compliant.

That's right, sounds like a perfect situation for Melvin type of fucks to short the hell out of it.

However after releasing plans to refocus its business on e-commerce and expand its digital storefront the shares shot up maintaining its compliance.

All shorts have to cover eventually.

Just look at the market cap of this company. This is nothing like GME. NAK(D) wil 10x-50x by itself without the hype of wsb. Now imagine if this gets picked-up by all the new and old members.

With or without this sub, this final stock-pick will make sure I am settled for life.

Short squeeze this, and there’s literally no limit. And it’s an asset the SEC can’t say shit about for market manipulation because the entire market in this sector is manipulated. Less regulation.

Many heavily lean left, and the really big subs unanimously lean left.

So why is the mainstream media calling you guys Nazis, alt-right actors, and comparing you to the people who stormed the capitol?

I'll tell you why, because it's something that has been happening to us moderate, right-centrist conservatives for years now, at least since 2017. You've done something that the main stream media and other powerful individuals don't like, something they *actually* don't like. You've done something that goes against the narrative they'd like to create, that goes against the power structures they have put in place, and you did it using their own system against them. So they resort to their tried and true tactic: you're Nazis. You're greedy, selfish fascists, alt-right radicals, possibly terrorists, even!

You know you're not alt-right radicals. Most of you probably hate even moderately right-wing views. We probably wouldn't get along in any other context, because I lean center-right. You know that these groups are straight-up lying about you and your political views.

Welcome to our world. It's been happening to us for years now. Any time we protest (I'm not talking about the capitol, but things like people going in their cars to protest lockdowns - not even outside, in their cars), it's ""alt-right radicals,"" ""neo-Nazi proud boys,"" etc. When really, it's just ordinary people who don't like the status quo and want to change it.

That's what's happening to you right now. You are living through it. I have sympathy for you, because I know what it's like to feel like I'm being lumped in with violent radicals and racists when I'm none of those things.

You know you're not Nazis. I know you're not Nazis. They know you're not Nazis. But the masses who know nothing about Reddit's political tendencies, have never heard of /r/wallstreetbeets and don't even know why there's an r in front of it, and who are just now hearing about this in the context of articles telling them there are ""alt-right connections"" and ""parallels to Nazis"" here don't know that, and they'll believe the lie because they've believed the same lie over and over and over again.

The next time you read about an event ""organized by Nazis"" or a group ""with ties to the alt-right,"" just think about this moment, and ask yourself, is that the truth? Or is it just narrative? Dig deeper, and find out if it's really the alt-right (because yes, sometimes it really is), or is it ordinary people who are tired of the status quo finally trying to do something about it?"|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165138.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']|[]

&#x200B;

Nokia and AMC are doing well! Congrats to the retards who got in early, but I would be wary. I'm not hating on the gains, but doesn't anyone find it odd how these two stocks traded over a BILLION in volume today? Sure, AMC's 900m debt relief might be a plus but I'll suck off my wife's step-boyfriend if that's the reason it shot up 300%+ today.

&#x200B;

And what's up with NOK?? They might have decent long term prospects, but there's literally no good reason for all this volume today. By \*pure\* chance, a good number of the bigger stock brokers all had some ""issues"" when it came to trading GME. \[TD claims that the problem was volume\]([https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-amc-trading-is-now-being-restricted-at-td-ameritrade-11611769804](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-amc-trading-is-now-being-restricted-at-td-ameritrade-11611769804)), but how could this be the case when GME only traded 90m volume today, not even a tenth of AMC?

&#x200B;

All of this happening while we have bots FLOODING this sub with low effort garbage about buying these stocks? What are they hoping to achieve? Are they trying to \[artificially link WSB to these stocks?\]([https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/27/gamestop-amc-reddit-short-sellers-wallstreetbets/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/27/gamestop-amc-reddit-short-sellers-wallstreetbets/)) Are they trying to deceive new subs to buy these stocks? Are they doing their own pump and dump to offset some of their losses? I don't know.

&#x200B;

\*What I do know\* is that I'm ALL IN on GME, and I don't plan to sell before next week. CNBC can try as hard as they want to spread misinformation, I can't hear them anyway from inside my 🚀. Every day we hold is another day the short interest burns. They're not getting shares from these 💎🙌.

Without exhausting my ass-kissing above, now is the time to get real.

How would you like to stick it to the man, while making sure that the man is never able to fuck us back? Overstock's biggest crown jewel, T-zero, is working on the next generation of stock trading platforms, based on the bl0ckchain. The same giant dildo that everyone's fAvOuRitE c0iN has been riding on for years. Imagine a world where these shorts could never attack, where only fair maidens stand by, awaiting your grand entrance, to shower you with riches.

You have won the battle with GME. Now come win the WAR dear one. Set your legacy, so no one may fuck with the might of the retard autist again.

Fear not, the big swingin dick of GME is shaking out tendies even if you haven't boarded the rocket.  So I'm sure you're thinking to yourself this autist is here to push amc, or bb etc, well that's where you're wrong kiddo.  GME's historic rise from the ashes is blowing up accounts left right (not everyone can be as special as the the WSB gang).  As these accounts are blowing up and bleeding red, the owners of these accounts are going to have to close out positions to get square.  So what does this have to do with tendies?  VXX is what.  So I first noticed the spike in VXX when GME made its first big move on Monday, the patterns were almost identical with vxx spiking 10 mins after gamestop. As GME continues to rise other parts of the market are going to continue to bleed as shorts have no other option than having a fire sale. On top of this the really arrogant ones are thinking they can ride this out and they are going close everything they can to keep from taking that big fat L on GME.  Now just a few things to point out, this isn't investment advice just be as autistic as you want, also if you are invested in GME or willing to take the risk at these levels than stick with GME.  I repeat, do not sell or use money you are willing to put in GME on this.  GME is the rocket, this is just picking up the tendies that fell out at launch. Enjoy the ride my brother's, and remember that in this crazy market there are lots of ways to make money. 

TLDR: if you're sitting on the sidelines of GME but want the crumbs of those tendies take a look at VXX.

There are those who have gained from the increase in the value of the shares and those who have bought options to buy GameStop shares at values ​​prior to the bubble, or those who have shorted these securities, lending them at a low price and binding the investor to buy them back at market price in the future. Several low-level traders on Reddit have therefore led to the loss of several Hedge Funds traders. In summary, the r / wallstreetbets group is made up of individuals who want to earn, some users also seek ideological revenge, comparing this situation to the 2008 crisis, which are clearly different given the government causes and all the dynamics of the fundamentals that occurred in that period . Indeed, the 2008 crisis was not orchestrated by a single hedge fund, but the combination of low interest rates, real estate incentives and financial innovations not controlled and used by the same state agencies as the two FMs are a completely different case. In any case, users are trying to push up the values ​​of certain actions, in order to make money. Certainly hedge funds will have to hire workers who control these unconventional but legitimate groups of investors. However, it is clear that the income of the redditors comes exclusively from the options they have stipulated with hedge funds and from the first sales. The value of the shares that grows in itself does not take money away from any solid institution, in fact the shares are inflated by the same individuals who want to earn by selling, it is only to understand who can sell before the value goes down and who will have to pay for others , but it is a new battle between the poor (or at least between ordinary individuals). However, it will be possible in the future to organize for new options, given that the inflated shares will not reflect dividends on that value (GameStop does not grant dividends worth a single share of 400 euros), and certainly conventional financial institutions will have to try to keep under control or ally with unconventional ones. But there is nothing revolutionary, the markets are made up of different competing institutions, the 2008 crisis is obviously different (look for Vernon Smith and all the other economists who have talked about it, and the losses of the hedge funds themselves). of course the gain initially took place, but now it is only redditors who inflate each other's shares and transfer losses from fluctuations, hedge funds will be careful not to take options during this period, they will not promise to buy at a future market price (hedge funds fund therefore will not shock) and will not allow you to buy an option on a share they own and then risk reselling the share at a low price compared to the market. The frenzy is already over, the gains from Wall Street have already been taken, the rationality of the market will bring the shares back to their initial value, because companies cannot guarantee dividends for that value. The loss began, but some fast traders were still able to make money. The individual gains more importance, hedge funds will always have to deal with it. I see a good decentralization effect and widespread nihilism, but interest rate policies and bailouts have nothing to do with this event, it's just a market distortion that has turned out to be more positive for the poorer counterpart, but which will now charge. the price to the less informed newcomers. For the situation of the bailouts, rules on the stability of banks are necessary, which is the responsibility of individual managers. In short, a one-off loss does not resolve the situation, nor indiscriminate taxation towards such different institutions, as proposed by the AOC which sees only a large casino in the markets, and not also the institution that in 2020 clearly communicated the need to overcome the 'use of oil, not because there is a single moral being behind it, but because financial institutions are the necessary tool to create a price system and provide credit to possible productive companies.

The SEC will still monitor the situation, but if it does not find any major player who has put in place a Pump and Dump strategy, i.e. the coordination and spreading of rumors to buy a stock, to raise the price beyond the fundamental, and resell it later, SEC will not be able to do anything to hit the group, made up exclusively of individuals who participate in a ponzi scheme but without any central director, only more or less clever players. Robinhood prevented the purchase of GameStop shares, probably to decrease the value and reduce losses of hedge funds, but being a free market there are companies like Webull or Sofi that still allow you to buy shares, the ponzi scheme therefore continues."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165139.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'AOC', 'SEC', 'SEC']|[]

GME the people of WSB have put a ton of faith in you. 

So here is how i think you should reward them:

1. It is time to **take Sony over.** The PS5 platform + TV can transform gaming and entertainment. Don't worry about xbox. they are shit.
2. imbed the following technology into all new TVs 65 and greater:

2.1 ) a ultra high end GPU

2.2) high end processor. these two things, will enhance TV + gaming. (aka a ps6 with the above 2)

2.3) camera (for fitness apps, video conferencing and home schooling.... this will position is for 2025 and beyond) No need for our schools to have the operating costs they do.

2.4) ability to connect up to 8 controllers

2.5) bluetooth for keyboard hookup.

2.6) a storage device that can store games, stream movies, and act as a home server.

**If Sony doesn't sell. Take over AMD.**

Everyone please upvote if this is what you want the GME management team to do."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165140.csv|StockTicker|['GME', 'THIS', 'HOULD', 'BE', 'YOUR', 'ATEGY', 'TO', 'MAKE', 'THIS', 'MOVE', 'WORTH', 'IT', 'SONY', 'OR', 'AMD', 'TAKE', 'OVER']|['GME', 'IT', 'AMD']|['GME', 'WSB', 'TV', 'GPU', 'TV', 'AMD', 'GME']|['GME', 'TV', 'TV', 'AMD', 'GME']

Not only that, but you're all using what little money you have as a collective to fight the big money collective...balls of steel in diamond hands. Seriously, you guys are modern heroes and gave an uncountable amount of people some hope.

Now, onto the bitter of the sweet. The entities you're all up against screw large amounts of people over all the time for a literal living. You're essentially playing a game against an opponent who can switch it off and claim victory at any time. What you're currently experiencing through trading platforms is them just unplugging your controller which is just the first phase. In their eyes, you guys actually winning would set a multi-trillion dollar loss precedent and you would all essentially become the new Wallstreet under your current platform. Right now, you're starting an inside/source trading war against the big banks, insurance companies, regulators, multiple hedge funds, old-money wealthy families and federal government entities.

I think you guys are badass and this is the revolution we've all been waiting for, but I want you guys to be careful and not put up what you can't afford to lose. I think that this is the best time to do it due to the political power transfer, I just wanted to make sure that you're all willing to lose and you still have something to live off of.

However I have seen the somewhat sloppy claim that Melvin Company could not have closed their position, apparently solely because GME was shorted 140% and that is not exactly true.

You can return a loaned share and then just buy the same share to give back more loans. For example giving back 100 shares worth 300$ to loaner A on Monday and then immediately buying the same shares for 301$ to give them back to loaner B on Tuesday. So it would have been possible for them to close their positions Wednesday. We simply cannot see what exactly drove the market up it could be us retail investors together with hedge funds desperately closing their positions, but it could also be that part of the volume is hedge funds already going long to hedge their losses (as they usually do in a short squeeze).

To be clear: I am not saying they closed it did, nor am I saying you should sell, this is still on enormous opportunity and I would not be surprised at all if CNBC lied about it. I am just saying it would be possible so please be aware of the risk, especially if you invest now.

If you have already considered this, just ignore it and I wish you well on your way to the moon. If you have any additional information to why they couldn't (or just as of now didn't) plese let me know.

Good luck squeezing!"|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165140.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['I', 'I', 'GME', 'A', 'B', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'CNBC', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'B']

I'll use AAL as an example.

They went through a bankruptcy and merger through the end of the 1st decade of the 2000s.  Stock price peaked at $40 and then went as low as .50c.  After that low, AAL reorganized and shed debts to again peak at around $50.  So if you put down $5000 at the last low and got out at the last peak you would walk away with $500,000.  Now I suspect that AAL will go through a similar process of bankruptcy in the nearish future and we may see something like this again...

Other airlines could be like this but I chose AAL as a representative example.  Is anyone else here thinking about these companies like this?

About CTRM - Castor Maritime Inc. is an international provider of shipping transportation services through its ownership of dry bulk vessels.

The direct offering also includes warrants that are exercisable at 19 cents each. These warrants can be exercised immediately and expire five years after their issue date.

Castor Maritime notes that the offering has the company gaining about $26 million in gross proceeds.

The company’s focus is on international shipping with its own dry bulk vessels.

It targets medium-term charters and focuses on several dry goods, such as coal or grains.

CTRM’s bulk fleet is made up of six vessels and the company is looking to expand with the acquisition of more ships.

Castor Maritime is still a fairly new company having only been founded in 2017.

The company is led by Petros Panagiotidis, who is the founder, chairman, CEO, and CFO of CTRM.

CTRM is experiencing heavy trading today with more than 261 million shares changing hands. To put that in perspective, the company’s daily average trading volume is 34.79 million shares. CTRM stock was up 21.7% as of Tuesday morning

This is my first post here. Been a regular over at the sub SPACs. You guys should definitely come over. Some good DD on SPACs which end up merging with some exciting companies, such as EV/renewable energy companies, and doubling in a day on occasion, all with very minimal downside risk.

I've known about this sub for a while, but I've decided to write my first post after what happened to GME which is all over the place. That is the craziest shit I've ever seen, you guys are nuts! Congrats to all those who printed alot of tendies.

On to our topic for the day. First off, for those of you autists (yeah I speak the language) who do not know, a SPAC is a shell company with no operations and which raises money through IPO. It then looks for a company it decides to merge with. If both sides can strike a deal, the money raised through the SPAC is given to the target company in exchange for part ownership in that company, meaning the holders of the SPAC's shares become shareholders of the acquired company once the deal goes through. Simple enough.

Now I believe there is a good chance that Vy Global Growth, a SPAC that IPO'd late September 2020, is likely to eventually merge with Reddit, thereby turning VYGG's shares into shares of Reddit.

Of course this is not a sure thing (nothing is when it comes to markets), but the below reasons lend support to this likely outcome:

1- Reddit CEO Steve Huffman: “The Company will consider going public in the future.” Source: https://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-is-reportedly-considering-an-ipo-2017-11

2- Guess who's one of the directors in Vy Global Growth. From VYGG's prospectus:

"" Steve Huffman will serve as one of our directors following the completion of this offering. Mr. Huffman is the Co-Founder, Director and CEO of Reddit, the “front page of the internet” and the sixth most visited site in the U.S.""

3- SPAC sponsors generally provide an indication as to the industries they are targeting. From the prospectus: ""We are a newly formed blank check company that intends to partner with a technology business that will benefit from our global expertise to define the future of its industry.""

4- Vy Global Growth indicates that it prefers ""Founder-led companies"" (sound familar?). From the prospectus: "" We look for businesses that are founder-led with a long-term vision."" Reddit is of course founded and currently led by none other than our Steve Huffman.

5- Link between VY Capital and Reddit: Vy Capital funded Reddit in a recent round (i.e. it owns part of it). That gives it preferential treatment in case it wanted to take it public through an associated vehicle. Source: https://www.inc.com/christine-lagorio/reddit-300-millon-dollar-funding-round-tencent.html

6- Vy Global Growth indicated it is not prohibited from acquiring a stake in a company affiliated with Vy Capital. From the prospectus: ""We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with Vy Capital."" Why would they include such a clause? Probably intend to exercise their right as per this clause?

As you can see, loads of datapoints supporting the possibility that VYGG is likely to end up merging with Reddit. As I write this, VYGG shares are at $11, indicating a maximum possible loss of $1 (since VYGG is currently nothing but a pile of cash with $10 of cash per share). This is how the most risk averse person should think of the downside here, though the actual downside is probably $0.5 per share based on how its been trading since it IPO'd.

The upside? If we get lucky and it does end up taking Reddit public? Easily $20 on day 1, and higher afterwards 🚀🚀🚀.

This (along with several other SPACs I currently own) offer some of the best risk-reward setups I've ever seen in my life.

Let me know what you guys think."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165141.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['DD', 'GME', 'I', 'SPAC', 'IPO', 'SPAC', 'I', 'SPAC', 'CEO', 'CEO', 'U', 'S', 'SPAC', 'VY', 'VYGG', 'I', 'VYGG', 'VYGG', 'I']|['DD', 'GME', 'CEO', 'CEO', 'S']

You're not going to win because you have no standing and/or it's your own fault, let me save you some fees:

**Robinhood**: you're sitting on your bike with training wheels wondering why they won't let you ride down the mountain.  Get a real broker instead of a 3rd party app.  They're not manipulating the market; they're trying to protect their stupid-ass users (you) from blowing up their accounts which WILL hurt their bottom line.  If you lose all your money on a GME swing you can't buy FDs next week; they don't want a lump-sum payment.

**Any other brokerage**: they didn't restrict stock purchases or closing out existing options, just opening new option positions.  This isn't market manipulation, this is protecting their bottom line from mouth-breathers who don't understand impVol (1000%?  All in!!!) and don't want to be on the hook for a bunch of noob retard losses.  Have margin requirements gone up?  Damn straight; but so has the borrow rate.

**CNBC**: they're not out to get you; they're not a collective intent on bringing down meme stocks any more than WSB is a collective intent on pumping meme stocks (see what I did there?).  If they report bad info, it's because that's the info they were provided (opinion pieces withstanding).

These are unprecedented times (well, at least in the past few years) and everyone's looking out for themselves, not trying to help Melvin and Citron (expect the other hedge funds).  This isn't market manipulation; it's fight-or-flight of the business world -- if you're too fragile to understand this or spread too thin to adjust, you probably should be sitting this out.

&#x200B;

If the plan is to just keep buying, then it feels like a pyramid scheme, those who bought in early need more buyers to avoid a loss.

The Biden Regime is currently “monitoring” the development on Reddit. It’s hilarious how this website aka a private company was insanely against Trump and for him getting canceled. Now I’m 100% against censorship and Cancel Culture. However I’m not above laughing at the Irony If Reddit goes the way of Parler. 

It’s truly hilarious how the manipulation of a Election is okay when it’s on Social Media. But when you manipulate the Stock Market on Social Media and it’s suddenly White Supremacy. And something something Trump Dark Side. Again I dont wish Censorship on anyone. But god dam it will be fucking Karma if Reddit goes the way of Parler. You started banning Political Enemies like The_Donald. A sub with over a million people. Karma has a way of catching up to you. And it would be fucking hilarious if the Biden Regime which Reddit supports pulls the plug on Reddit. 

It’s more than just one sub. Because that’s how Reddit’s business model works. You ban one sub and you can just make another. Reddit as a whole will probably get canned because the elites are pissed. If You support Cancel Culture then you will eventually be cancelled. Because Karma is a Bitch. Reddit Admins are probably shitting themselves right now because Reddit has been mentioned on Tucker Carlson, and CNN and a few other networks. And not in a good light. Even though Tucker did stand up for this sub. (Even though he did not mention us by name). The Irony that Fox stands up for Reddit while everyone else calls on Fox to be cancelled on Reddit.

If you’re in GME, keep fighting the good fight! 🚀🚀🚀 I missed that rocket but am balls deep in BB calls (3/5 16c and 6/18 18c). Once you’ve collected your tendies and want to get into something else… stick your load into GoPro. Yes, that’s right. GoPro. I’m going to keep this short but I can do a longer DD if people are interested.

**1. Revenues are up 109% in 3Q20 from 2Q20**

Sure, during COVID GoPro at first took a tumble. No shit, people weren’t traveling. However, people started having lives and doing shit outside. As a result - Gopro had a massive surge in 3Q revenues. Revenues for the full-year will be slightly down but guess what? They massively cut costs so they improved their margin tremendously!

**2. Shift from Retail to Online**

Pretty self-explanatory. Online revenues were typically less than 30% but have been on the rise. 4Q expectation was >40% and for 2021 the majority of their camera revenues to come from online. **This means more tendies in the bank due to higher margin, tards.**

**3. Shift to Recurring Revenue Streams**

This is where it gets juicy. GoPro has been steadily increasing their subscribers for their subscription service. Think unlimited cloud storage, damage replacement, accessory perks, etc. **As companies take the volatility out of their top-line, their multiples go up which means tendies** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. They struggled to get above 200K subs for a while but then they hit 500K in 3Q20. Projected to be over 700K by end of 2020. **For 2021 they expect more than 2M subs which at $50/year is $100M in cash flow @ 50% margin!!!** That’s more money for you to blow than your wife’s BF blows on his coke addiction. **85% of Hero9 Purchases were with a subscription** (To be fair a discount was offered but nevertheless people are slow to cancel subscriptions and GoPro is banking on the fact that they can keep these customers).

Also, they are looking to create a subscription service for just the app (no GoPro hardware) because people use it a ton for storage and editing. This is a low-risk high-reward opportunity for them.

**4. The Cameras are Actually Pretty Good**

Hero 9 Black and Hero8 are webcam enabled and have solid reviews. Do your own research. I’ve owned two models now and I love them. My wife’s step-bro exclusively uses our GoPro for POV videos. Joke’s on him though, I back them all up on the app for later.

Their mix of camera sales with a MSRP of >$300 have grown from \~54% in 2018 >80% in 3Q20. Despite rising prices, consumers like the brand and are still buying the products.

**5. Their Balance Sheet is Basically Neutral and They’re not going Bankrupt**

GoPro recently raised some additional convertible debt ($125M @ 1.25%) to repay their old debt and invest in the company or acquire someone (maybe a drone company)? They expect to end the year with $225M in cash w/ debt of \~$215M.

**6. Lots of Untapped Markets**

As people start to travel again, I expect sales to further benefit. However, think of all the stuff they have yet to tap into: dashcams, drones, webcams. There’s so much opportunity out there for them. DJI has been put on the same governmental entity list as Huawei and has been flagged for violating human rights. There are reports (I’m an autist not a reporter) that DJI provided surveillance drones for Chinese dentition camps and more bans are likely to come in the future. What does this have to do with GoPro you may ask? It gives them an opportunity to get back into the drone market.

Their presence is also growing in the international markets. Up 31% in EMEA and up 172% in APAC.

**7. Short Interest**

GoPro is reported to have a 13.2% short float but about half the shares are locked up by institutions. We’re looking at a true percentage of 26%. While this squeeze would not be on the same level of GME, IT WILL STILL TAKE OFF!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀

**TLDR: GOPRO MAKES CAMERAS, HAS GOOD FINANCES, SELLS SUBSCRIPTION BASED CLOUD STORAGE, AND WANTS TO PUT MORE TENDIES IN YOUR POCKETS** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀

**POSITIONS:**

**1/29 13C – 60 CONTRACTS**

**2/19 13C – 25 CONTRACTS**

Their stock has dropped from a 1-year high of $35 when their acquisition by Cineworld was announced, and steeply dropped as the pandemic worsened. Their current share price is $11.50 Canadian dollars, or $8.98 US dollars. Their stock was pushing $55 CAD until mid-2017. They hold a majority of the theatre market share in Canada with 175 theatres and 75% market share. They’re also a short-seller’s favourite, with 2.2 million of 62.34 million shares held by short sellers. 

They mainly operate typical movie theatre screens, but they also offer an increasing number of premium VIP theatres. They have diversified their income streams, owning “The Rec Room” eats and entertainment experiences, with nice restaurants, VR experiences, and more. They should be opening a new 40,000 sqft Rec Room in Burnaby, BC once vaccination rates rise. They additionally have stakes in esports through Player One, and own two advertising companies named Cineplex Media and Cineplex Digital Media.

However, there is potential risk, particularly regarding their botched deal with Cineworld going to court, but I personally don’t think Cineworld will come out on top as their claims don’t hold much water (they’re upset Cineplex didn’t “operate as required under the acquisition deal” as a result of closing under public health orders during the pandemic, but their deal allows for “emergencies and acts of God”.)

melvin used the $2.75b bailout money and bought long positions at $80 and up with the leverage they have at their brokers

together with their hedge friends they now own substantial volume.. they have also taken up new short positions at 300-400 (as reflected by the short ratio jump).. at a predetermined point, they will cash out their longs and make bank on their new shorts as the price plummets... theres probably some ratio and price points that will work out in their favour

when the price settles below $15 they close their old shorts leaving retails holding $200-300 bags

melvin was never in any trouble to begin with.. sure they have interest payments, but thats a problem money can solve

so is there a scenario where melvin can minimise their losses, or even come up on top?"|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165142.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|[]|[]

Here's the deal, retards:

LKNCY is a Chinese coffee company, and it's bigger than Starbucks there. It's cheap, and they use an app-order business model which has been very efficient and innovative. As of Jan. 2020, they managed 4,507 stores in China. Why, then, is their stock priced at only $13?

Fraud. In mid-2020, it came out that they had inflated their 2019 sales numbers. This resulted in the stock price plummeting from $50 to $2, top executives including the CEO being fired, and getting delisted from NASDAQ.

The stock price has slowly climbed back up under the new management, and on Dec. 16, 2020, they settled with the SEC. The stock price spiked that day. It's gone all the way up to $13, in recent days, in anticipation of a JPL report being released on Jan. 29th.

In my opinion, this stock is still extremely undervalued, looking at where it was before the fraud case. They're now starting off with a clean slate, and a ton of locations in the world's second-largest economy. Starbucks is valued about 7.5x more, in terms of stock price. Also, there's been some heavy manipulation seen. I think we can make this shit fly if you all hop in. Let me know what you think."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165142.csv|StockTicker|['LKNCY', 'GME']|['GME']|['LKNCY', 'CEO', 'ASDAQ', 'SEC', 'JPL', 'I']|['CEO']

Here's the deal. As others have stated Robinhood turns out to be the Sheriff of Nottingham. So, fuck 'em. 

Open another brokerage account. I'm choosing TD. If I do a wire transfer I'll have the money with-in the day (and probably in less than an hour).

Once your funds clear in the new spot, close EVERYTHING OUT in RH.. Yes, I'm talking about GME, AMC, BB, etc.. everything. Now I hear you shouting me down from the back about diamond hands, and I got you!

Once your funds in your new account have cleared, buy your positions in RH and then close those positions in RH. You won't take any personal loss/gain but you may realize a loss/gain in RH. This will only change things slightly at tax time. I know you can't do math, so I'll help you out.

GME Buy: $82.66  
Sell in RH to GTFO: $$277.59  
Buy in TD: $277.59\*  
Sell after the infinity squeeze: $4200.69!

As you can see the 2 middle trades cancel each other. Now you probably won't be able to fill at the exact same price because GME is volatile as fuck. But that may work to your benefit even. But if you do them at basically the same time the difference will be minimal. 

If people wait to close their accounts till next week, or 2 weeks or a month from now, Robinhood will not get the message TODAY that they can't just change the rules. We've become a more united entity, let's show them we won't be fucked with!

Now go make your wife's bf a sandwich!

EDIT:
Another option that some may like better is to just transfer your positions out of RH. From RH's website (and copied from a comment below):

Transfer Stocks Out Of Your Robinhood Account | Robinhood
robinhood.com › support › articles › transfer-stocks-ou...You can transfer stocks and cash to other brokerages through ACATS (Automated Customer Account Transfer Service) transfer. If you want to keep your Robinhood account, you can initiate a partial transfer. Otherwise, you can initiate a full transfer, and we'll close your account once the process is complete.

Note: This has a $75 fee and will take a few business days."|2021-01-28 16:50:44.256227|../output/raw/2021/01/28/StockTicker_165142.csv|StockTicker|['RH']|['RH']|['TD', 'I', 'THING', 'OUT', 'RH', 'GME', 'AMC', 'BB', 'I', 'I', 'RH', 'RH', 'RH', 'I', 'GME', 'RH', 'GME', 'TODAY', 'RH', 'ACATS']|['TD', 'OUT', 'RH', 'GME', 'AMC', 'RH', 'RH', 'RH', 'GME', 'RH', 'GME', 'RH']

Hope you're having an awesome Wednesday.

Just wanted to drop in and share a monthly dividend payout. 

The stock : XDV

[https://www.blackrock.com/ca/investors/en/products/239496/ishares-canadian-select-dividend-index-etf](https://www.blackrock.com/ca/investors/en/products/239496/ishares-canadian-select-dividend-index-etf)

It's an iShares Canadian Select Dividend (basically they have their stocks in other banks). They're not doing too bad, I bought at 17 and it's floating around 25. 

Something to check out if you're looking for something somewhat safe and new. They've been on a slow trend upwards for quite some time and since they're going into banks, I'm assuming it's a safe stock.

Now that I actually have money (and it seems like people are putting a lot of eyes into this subreddit) I thought I'd sneak in between the chaos of Gamestop and ask a few questions:

Where can I find the rules/laws about filing for taxes? Is there a way I can set it up like a paycheck and pay ahead of time when I get the money? I heard I need to pay tax on stock I don't even have cashed out yet, where do I find more info on that as well?

Which app do you guys recommend? I was going to go with Robinhood because of brand recognition but after they shut down Gamestop buying I think I'd rather try another application instead. Preferably something I can use both on phone and PC. (PC is much preferred if I had to choose one.)
