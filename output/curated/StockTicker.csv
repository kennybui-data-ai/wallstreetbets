It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future.

&#x200B;

💎🙌🚀🚀\*\*TLDR at the bottom.\*\*🚀🚀💎🙌

&#x200B;

I do not think that you all here realize that we have essentially won yesterday at 9:58 AM and that we almost crashed the entire thing. There was a post here describing a [""30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb""](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

In this post, they described and expressed their outrage with the Interactive Brokers Chairman interview.

# THEY ARE CORRECT!

There was ANOTHER interview with  [Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RS4JIEVyXM&feature=youtu.be) that I did not see that received  as much attention here.

In this interview, it is a bit longer **(** **must watch imo).**

It explains *some* of the ambiguity with the previous interviews with Vlad from Robinhood and what happened in general.

# It confirms that:

1. THEY HAD A LIQUIDITY PROBLEM
2. THE SHORTS  ARE STARTING TO GO BUST
3. THE BROKERS ARE ON THE HOOK TO GET SHARES THAT THEIR CLIENTS CANT GET
4. THE BROKERS THEMSELVES CANNOT COVER THESE POSITIONS PROPERLY
5. THE CLEARING HOUSE ALSO CANNOT COVER AND ARE GETTING LOANS FROM THE BANKS DUE TO THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

&#x200B;

Essentially, we **liked** the stock so much 🚀🚀🚀  that the shorties (all my homies hate melvin capital and shitron) blew up so fast that the BROKERS could not properly margin call them in time.  THEY COULD NOT LIQUIDATE THEM IN TIME TO GET THEM TO COVER THEIR POSITIONS IN TIME.

Now, the brokers are on the hook to go get the shares for you if their clients cannot. THIS is why there is a margin call and margin maintenance to avoid this from happening. But we BLEW past all of this so fast that they are now on the hook since their clients the  **🌈🐻** now cannot get the share that they legally need to provide you.

Since these brokers are large, they usually have the capital to cover these losses and get the shares themselves. As [Thomas Peterffy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM&feature=youtu.be) flexes that he has billions to cover. When I heard it first has made me raise my eyebrows since why would he flex this number and then highlight the 15billion losses. Then it hit me... **THEY CANNOT COVER THESE POSITIONS.** These brokers are starting to not be able to clear these transactions so their clearing house does it for them.

The clearing house in short makes sure that when you sell your share you get your money in your account. They usually have about 1-2% of capital requirements for the stock that is being traded to make sure that they can settle the transaction. HOWEVER, for GME it is raised to a 100%.

**THE CLEARING HOUSE CANNOT SETTLE THESE TRANSACTIONS!**

Once Robinhood's clearinghouse went down the transactions started getting routed through Webull's clearing house ( I belive it is [Apex](https://www.apexclearing.com/) that they use). They almost IMMEDIATELY had to put a halt on it because they could not settle the transactions.

THEY STARTED TAKING LOANS FROM BANKS TO KEEP THEMSELVES FROM HALTING THE **ENTIRE** STOCK MARKET.

# THE ENTIRE STOCK MARKET WAS ABOUT TO COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEY WERE ABOUT TO NOT BE ABLE TO SETTLE THE TRANSACTIONS!

# THERE IS NOT ENOUGH STOCK TO GO AROUND!

At this point, what that all means is that THERE IS not enough stock to go around and the LOSES of these  **🌈🐻** are so **LARGE** that the brokers cannot get the shares that they are legally bound to do. And their CLEARING HOUSE cannot do it either.

THIS IS WHY THEY STOPPED YOU FROM BUYING BUT ALLOWED SELLING.

They used the short ladder attack and essentially in a low volume caused the price to drop by trading in between themselves to a point where they were sort of able to cover some losses. **BUT,**

IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS SHORT LADDER ATTACK,

The most beautiful thing happened...

# EVERYONE HELD:

(From [Luis Rossmann's Video (6:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enLiJfijWBI) )

[Bid vs Ask price difference is massive!](https://preview.redd.it/oaf0eab8m8e61.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb0bc1d6774794c8641d9e9aec287e42fc19e2f0)

Look at that difference between BID and ASK.

I love ALL of you.

You all  💎🙌  that shit so hard!

&#x200B;

You , yes **YOU** reading this , because **you** 💎🙌 that shit the price did not drop further. Because of every single one of you, they were not able to cover their positions.

&#x200B;

What this all means is that we are close to winning and we will not only take out the greedy **🌈🐻 hedge fund 🌈🐻** managers but also THE BROKERS, THE CLEARING HOUSES and the WHOLE THING.

&#x200B;

Now, this all means that we are very, very VERY close to winning. At this point, IF we manage to get all these options to exercise in the money today, it will be 15million -20 million shares that will have to be bought up by the market makers ( this is the gamma squeeze that is probably going to happen today and would then cause **the SQUEEZE** to the moon 🚀)

&#x200B;

At this point,  I plan to hold and you should too.

If we keep drying out these clearing houses, brokers like fidelity do not have clearing houses and there you should be able to buy freely. The more we clear them out the more they will have to cover and we have a chance for a real financial revolution.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR:

The brokers have let their **🌈🐻  clients🌈🐻** lose so much money so fast that they were not able to margin call them in time and now they are on the hook to provide the shares.

The losses are so large that THEY the BROKER are not able to provide the share and then the clearing house has to do it.

THE CLEARING HOUSE CANNOT PROVIDE THE SHARES because of the capital requirements for GME and they are borrowing from the banks.

This is creating a liquidity problem that can affect the entire market. Buy them out and then buy on brokers like Fidelity that do not have a clearing house.

This is why they stopped allowing GME to be bought but you could still sell it because they wanted to save their own asses.

Everyone here managed to 💎🙌  so hard that caused the price to stop falling and the BID/ASK price to increase drastically.

I am buying and holding.

🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀 🚀GME to the moon 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀 🚀

I have 15 shares @ $40.44 (not much I know but I am gonna reload asap) and I am planning to sell 10%-20% at $10k and hold to sell the rest of my position at $42,069.69/share

&#x200B;

EDIT:

I should have made it more clear, for people that are asking about what to do if they do the same halt on buys, use brokers that do not rely on clearing house like Fidelity

&#x200B;

That is not entirely true. 

RH is allowing anyone with ZERO shares of GME to buy up to 5.  Anyone with currently less than 5 shares can buy more up to a total portfolio of 5 shares.  Anyone with more than 5 shares can not purchase shares. 

This is important because these fuck clowns know that those of us carrying greater numbers of stock likely have the capacity to buy greater numbers of GME shares and reduce liquidity. 

They are simultaneously:
1)  manipulating the system
2) taking advantage of people with less funds
3) preventing a greater number of shares from being purchased

They did this so they could have a talking point in the media and during their congressional investigations and say “We reopened stock purchase of GME” and nobody will dig deeper. 

This is fucking dirty ass pool and fucking outright manipulation. 

Here’s the video proof:  https://imgur.com/a/AV3IGMa

Edit: and yes.  I do have other brokerage accounts and those are working fine. Shout out to my homies at SoFi, Fidelity, and Vanguard. I have GME stashed in those accounts too.

Edit 2: I’m not giving a pass to those fucks at other brokers too. Thomas “The Shit Engine” Fluffer at IBKR can eat a bag of fucking rotten cocks too.  Saying GME is worth $17 and the stock should be restricted until it drops to $17 because it’s overvalued.  Fuck you Fluffer. You know what’s overvalued at $17? Your shitty blowjobs. You give really shitty head you old lemon party fuck. ^no ^homo

Edit 3: RH has now dropped the shares you can buy to 2 shares. If you hold more than 2 shares you can not buy shares.  Go use another broker.  Fuck IBKR, Fuck RH and fuck the hedge funds and brokers.  They are gaming this entire thing.  Go ahead share this post with anyone not on reddit.  Everyone needs to know they are being bent over and violated without lube.  Market got caught doing retarded shit (shorting over 200% of GME) and now we all are suddenly the retards.  GO GET FUCKED Vlad the Cock Impaler and Thomas Fluffer and all of you fuck clowns.

Edit 4: Dear SEC - When GME was trading and trending above $350 is when RH and others dropped the share buy limit to 2 shares.  This is coordinated and planned manipulation.  $350 matters because if GME continues to trade consistently above $350 then gamma squeeze occurs for todays closing options.  This is coordinated and premeditated manipulation.

Here’s the proof of the new 2 share limit: https://i.imgur.com/RhwgoRu.jpg

#Edit 5: I made a comment that RH was stealing a share from my account.  We all have moments of retardation.  Some of us, like me, dwell in the retard.  I was wrong and I appreciate other redditors pointing out my mistake.  I've delete the comments and posts I made elsewhere.  RH has done enough shit wrong but disinformation, unintentional or not, is not what we are about.  I apologize for the honest mistake.  But fuck RH, IBKR, and the hedge funds anyway.  Nothing changes.

This text will be the most important piece that you’ll see today!!!

They didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —> price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

•	⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. •	⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. •	⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

•	⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. •	⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 3 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Tues or Wed next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 120% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

This is an unprecedented moment in Financial history. The establishment is balls deep in each others' arses and we saw that in the Citadel-Robinhood-Point72-StevenCohen collusion yesterday.

For those who missed what happened: Robinhood and other brokerage platforms coordinated a short attack on the retail investor by blocking buy orders and allowing only sell orders. This resulted in a near evaporation of buying volume and panic selling from a lot of understandably concerned stock holders.

It can be construed that this was happening on the orders of the great Citadel, who may have profited off opening short positions at the top. This was seen and caught by multiple order flow traders who noticed block trades. 

*A short ladder*

A short ladder was initiated. They closed the gates to retail and then block sold orders in the open market to drive down the prices. They did this between hedge funds A, B and C to maintain positions while profiting off their short positions (initiated at ATH). This can also be cross checked by looking at yesterday's volume, which was truly minimal. These HFs engineered the short ladder to use the low price to cover their short positions for cheap. Yet, the short interest dipped only marginally (from 140 percent to 120 percent) 

The idea was to have retail offload as many shares as possible to increase float, which will make covering the short positions easy. So now we know that this is what they want. They want us to sell. And they will try a variety of tricks to make us sell. The short ladder was one of those. 

So what can we do? And how will it matter? 

We do the opposite of what they want us to. We don't sell. How will this help the short squeeze? 

Not selling (and letting the buyers pile in) will add to the buying pressure. It will also reduce float. 

So when the shorts do choose to cover, they will need to buy again, and again, and again to cover their entire position.

So hear me out here let's do some quick math. Short interest (no of shares shorted/ no of available in float) = 120 percent. There are more shares shorted than exist to be bought. 

Investors like Burry and Cohen further reduce this float by piling in. In reality, the short is a good multiple of the float (this is my hunch). We have caught them by the balls and have a chance of changing the status quo. 

All you have to do is Hold and not increase the share float. Shorting Gamestop is becoming more expensive by the minute. The shorters need to pay their brokers margin to borrow shares too. By reducing float, we can make these HFs bleed more. 

By holding the line, we make HFs taste blood. 

To Valhalla. Or the Moon. 🚀🚀

Stop thinking they are your friend, don’t invest because they are on our side or because they said so. They are part of the group that has been fucking over everyone since time and now they know how they can make even more money. 

They encourage us to invest and hold because they will just profit even more as the value keeps rising, they aren’t doing this because they see injustice being done, they are doing this because it’s in *their* best interest.

Bail out both sides by liquidating the hedge funds, but not the brokers or clearinghouses, but also put a buy order in for $10k per share to allow GME shareholders to exit.  Isn’t $700 billion better than a financial meltdown?  Just like last time you can ‘put rules in place to make sure this won’t happen again’

In 2008 the banks held risky assets and got bailed out because they said the innocent normal people would be hurt even more if you didn’t bail them out, so the government did it.  

We posed a risk to the liquidity of the hedge funds, brokers, and clearinghouses yesterday.  By bankrupting them it would probably cause a temporary stock market crash as they liquidate their positions.  

Are we not now in the same position as the banks were in 2008?  Buy us out of our positions for $700 billion to save the rest of the market and the normal people right?

Edit because it got attention:  if this ever was a reality it would in the form of a loan to clearinghouses and brokers to cover any losses up to $10k per share.  They would have to pay it back over time.  The government would get the money back and reimburse taxpayers, while at the same time collecting taxes from the gains of the retail investors. Long term the clearinghouses and brokers recover, the market continues to function,  and then they never let hedge funds put on a risky play like that ever again. The hedge funds involved are deservedly bankrupt, and the retail traders get the reward they deserve by playing the free market game by the rules."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185649.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['GME']|['GME']

I plan on buying the NASDAQ one on Monday to (legally) stick it to Wall Street. Already sent in the order. 

My question is - I can probably afford a few hours, but what if we buy it out until the end of the week, the month, hell, even the year? I did the math, it's not that expensive to run it for 1 hour per day and the impact will be way higher than putting that money in the stock.

Best fucking customer service. He helped walk me through creating an account, changed my birthday, and walked me through get a transfer set up for my assets at Robin Hood.  The customer service is such a refresher from the nightmare we've had to deal with with Robin Hood.

I love capitalism. The power of competition. Fuck Robin Hood.

Edit: Anyone know how to fill out a customer service survey? I got the guy's name and want to let Fidelity know how impressed I was with him."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185652.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']|[]

I know it's Friday and some of you short-term monkey brains are thinking about bailing on your brothers. Your paper hands are beginning to cramp up. I get it. **BUT WE CANNOT SELL!**  


There are still **MASSIVE** amounts of shorts on $GME. Still well over 113% of total shares floated (*from S3 Partners*). Some old shorts have gotten out, but many **NEW** shorts have taken their place in the past couple of days hoping that $GME will die out.  


# Here is the key part...

They are literally PRAYING for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. They are HOPING that they can make back their money at our expense... **BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THEY HOLD THEIR SHORT POSITIONS IS COSTING THEM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY!!!**  


# BILLIONS A DAY.

All we need to do is **HOLD**. That's it. We will cost them so much money today, next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and on and on. Soon enough they won't be able to pay the cost of their shorts or it just won't be worth the cost anymore and they will all eventually have to bail. **THAT IS GOING TO BE THE SQUEEZE**. Once the costs keep adding up, they will start to bail and the rest will follow.  


WE MUST STAY STRONG. DON’T FORGET WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US. IT'S A GAME OF CHICKEN. WHOEVER BLINKS FIRST.. LOSES.  
We're not fucking blinking.

I remember when the housing collapse sent a torpedo through my family. My father's concrete company collapsed almost overnight. My father lost his home. My uncle lost his home. I remember my brother helping my father count pocket change on our kitchen table. That was all the money he had left in the world. While this was happening in my home, I saw hedge funders literally drinking champagne as they looked down on the Occupy Wall Street protestors. I will never forget that.

My Father never recovered from that blow. He fell deeper and deeper into alcoholism and exists now as a shell of his former self, waiting for death.

 This is all the money I have and I'd rather lose it all than give them what they need to destroy me. Taking money from me won't hurt me, because i don't value it at all. I'll burn it all down just to spite them.

This is for you, Dad.

This is false. You are buying and selling from real people or algorithms that believe they can scalp your order. The idealized scenario is that GME rallies, Melvin covers, and everyone at reddit gets out at the top. This represents a misunderstanding of market mechanics. Melvin will cover before we truly know it, and the crash will happen as quick as the rally.

So with recent events, you must ask yourself:

# Who is Your Counterparty?

Nothing is a sure bet. How confident are you that your counterparty is who you think it is? Thousands of redditors & new traders beyond have been buying stocks fully confident that Melvin Capital hasn't  exited their trade. This is also supported by some analysis provided by two different firms, although their estimates differ some amount. Confounded in this is the interpretation of the data: Does this include market makers and dealers that are short stock but covered with calls or options deltas? Is their information fully accurate in an event the likes of which has never happened? It's tough to know for sure. 

# Know Everyone's Hand

Your guess on *how much they've covered* and *when they covered* has a massive effect on how you perceive the value of this trade. Buying if you think Melvin has $10b notional to cover is a much better bet than if they only have $2b to cover. You also have to consider how much notional the rest of the market has bought in anticipation of a squeeze. The difference between the two represents your effective edge.

Remember, we don't *actually* know Melvin's current position. We don't know what's going on behind closed doors. We only know the hand they're showing us via media. Has their clearing firm taken over? Has a much bigger collection of firms absorbed the position? Have they been buying since Monday? Have they covered and have new funds entered the space at a much better level? 

You are fighting Goliath at a poker table in the city of Gath. The pot is worth $25 billion dollars. Ken Griffin has *never* lost. Melvin's prime brokers Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche are not used to losing (well, Deutsche is). They will do whatever it takes to take the pot *from you* and leave you holding the bag. They will not blink twice because there is a *lot* of *fucking money* on the line.

# Know What Can Go Wrong

Nobody could have guessed everything that happened this week. Prepare yourself for the unexpected. Your brokerage will undoubtedly close out your position at the worst possible time. The stock could be halted for days. You could be assigned on ITM options. Your stock could get delisted. Your stock may get diluted.

# Only Spend What You're Willing to Lose

This one is self explanatory. Your investment could go to zero. Even if you think you make money on every trade, if your bet size is 100%, the long term value of your portfolio is **zero*****.***

# Don't Take Out Loans on Emotional Capital

If you are new, you really don't know the gut-wrenching, stomach-turning feeling of seeing the possibility of your net liquidity hitting zero or negative. It fucking sucks. You just know the highs. You're buying along the speculative frenzy and frantic rallies, wrapped in anti-billionaire & pro-underdog themes. It may even feel good to think that a guy who cut his teeth at a firm notorious for an insider trading scandal is getting his comeuppance. We love the feeling. **If you are fully invested financially & emotionally, you are completely overleveraged and will pay the price.** Make feeling good your goal, and set limits that you can stomach. 

There are several feel-good stories of people making life-changing money to pay off their student loans or their family members' surgeries. Please think twice about this, and only spend what you can afford to lose. If placing a bet makes the difference between your pet living or dying, you may have a gambling problem. These were success stories because they got in at a much better level and could have had a much sadder ending.

Secondly, don't take it personal. There are people on the other side of your trades, your brokerage support line, the subreddit, the media. They are all playing their own hand to the best of their knowledge. It's easy to blame a broker, yell at their support desk, hate-tweet at a company, or even rage-text that guy you know who develops APIs at ETrade. A lot of people across the industry are *rooting* for you. Fuck, even Ted Cruz and AOC are *rooting* for you, because this transcends politics. If you're mad at Melvin Capital or Ken Griffin or the guys who crashed the economy in 2008, keep it that way. They will try and misdirect your anger in every single direction: brokerages, the media, and reddit. If your enemies are a few guys at the top holding a $25b short position and moving levers, keep it that way. 

Thirdly, if you don't want to be a human being for the sake of the person on the other side, be a human being for your wallet's sake. You make better financial decisions in the absence of emotions."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185646.csv|StockTicker|['A']|[]|['GME', 'ITM', 'A', 'AOC']|['GME']

1-Even though buying seems to be back, it can change again in any moment and your orders may not fill. When the dip comes again, AND IT WILL, DO NOT SELL. You may think you can sell all your positions and buy back in on the cheap, BUT THERES NO GUARANTEE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BUY BACK IN. JUST HOLD AND WE WIN. DONT BELIEVE ANY SHORT FLOAT LIES TODAY.

2-Our buying preassure is low today thanks to rh fucking us, and mainly because most of us are already holding. At this point its a game of waiting them out and NOT pussying out in their attacks.

3-Melvin fucked up with this whole situation, but these guys are NOT stupid. They have harvard mathmaticians and professional risk analysts. They probably figured out that their losses will be marginally LESS for holding their positions open and paying the borrowing fees than it would be if they covered now. They want to wear us down over time by blocking us from buying, sniping stop losses with ladders and constant media attacks like that sellout Cramer saying the squeeze is over. ALL we have to do is hold, and we will win. If you keep selling, they can slowly cover over time while keeping the price steady.

Credit to [u/Pcbuildingnoob699](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pcbuildingnoob699/) \-- I'm rephrasing so it's just pure information/education and not financial advice.THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, THIS IS PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.

When might you want to sell? A quick guide for GME noobs.TL;DR: DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌

&#x200B;

Too much disinformation about when to sell. We are seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (WHICH IS ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT IN YOUR FINANCIAL INTEREST) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how some smart investors will play the ending. \[Note: I u/TheKageyOne, will not be selling at all, at least not for a long time. I'm in this to hurt the shorts, send a message, and watch GME grow and restructure into a totally new e-commerce and brick and mortar business in the coming years).

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

* imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.
* Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to **START** covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's **NOT** gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If people hold GME stocks play it right and hold while shorts cover, they can literally squeeze this to infinity as the shorts try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND DO WITH THIS INFORMATION WHAT YOU WILL. A LOT OF YOU ARE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

&#x200B;

Edit: Yes, I realize the days to cover reported in those links is actually lower now. I don't know enough to tell you what is accurate. I do know enough to tell you that if an investor buys and holds a share, there are fewer shares available for the shorts to cover with, so holding drives up the Days to Cover. If YOU are holding shares, YOU are controlling the Days to Cover.

Why This Weekend Is So Crucial...

Ok listen up retards... I know it's Friday and some of you short-term monkey brains are thinking about bailing on your brothers. Your paper hands are beginning to cramp up. I get it. **BUT WE CANNOT SELL!**  


There are still **MASSIVE** amounts of shorts on $GME. Still well over 113% of total shares floated (*from S3 Partners*). Some old shorts have gotten out, but many **NEW** shorts have taken their place in the past couple of days hoping that $GME will die out.  


# Here is the key part...

They are literally PRAYING for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. They are HOPING that they can make back their money at our expense... **BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THEY HOLD THEIR SHORT POSITIONS IS COSTING THEM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY!!!**  


# BILLIONS A DAY.

All we need to do is **HOLD**. That's it. We will cost them so much money today, next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and on and on. Soon enough they won't be able to pay the cost of their shorts or it just won't be worth the cost anymore and they will all eventually have to bail. **THAT IS GOING TO BE THE SQUEEZE**. Once the costs keep adding up, they will start to bail and the rest will follow.  


WE MUST STAY STRONG. DON’T FORGET WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US. IT'S A GAME OF CHICKEN. WHOEVER BLINKS FIRST.. LOSES.  
We're not fucking blinking.  


**TL/DR: HOLD. HOLD. HOLD. THIS WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK IS CRUCIAL!**  
*(Not financial advice. Entertainment only)*

Edit 1: STOP GIVING ME AWARDS, I AM ONLY PASSING ON THE ADVICE OF OTHERS. KEEP UPVOTING THIS FOR ALL TO SEE. TO THE MOON BRETHREN 🚀

Edit 2: PREP FOR THE SHORT LADDER ATTACK. EXPECT SOME BULLSHIT FROM THE HF’S TODAY. EXPECT IT, WE ARE MAKING THEM SWEAT.

Edit 3: ITS FUCKING HAPPENING. HOLD THE LINE YOU APES! DIAMOND HANDS ARE FOREVER!🚀🤲🏻💎

Edit 4: Please direct your gratitude and awards to the OP, the one who actually deserves it. I am only echoing their call! HOLD THE LINE!

They have to cover their shorts at some point in time. Why do you think they only disabled purchases yesterday?

If the price was static, with no market movement, hedge funds would lose. Even if you took your orders off the market to buy, they can’t manipulate the stock low enough to save themselves.

Think about it: the hedge funds have to go long at some point in time to cover. All we have to do is wait and let them kill themselves in the process.

As the legendary Sun Tzu said in the Art of War: “the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.” Follow his words.

Stay zen. Stay calm. We like the stock.

Yesterday they disable the ability to buy any stock we talk about here.

Today they limit our ability to buy stocks and options.

4 hours in they cut those limits by half.

Now they are “experiencing high traffic” and there are delays on deposits and transactions.


WE NEED TO LEAVE THIS FUCKING PLACE THEY BETRAYED US. DO YOUR RESEARCH AND MOVE TO ANOTHER PLATFORM, WHO WILL NOT BULLSHIT YOU AND SCREW YOU AS BAD AS ROBINHOOD HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO.

Don’t bother with transferring your account over for now, you will just freeze your current shares for 1-2 weeks or however long Robinhood decides to delay. 

***You can open a new account now on a new platform and begin trading from there. Do not sell your shares on Robinhood.***


Robinhood you betrayed us.

Why?!? Because now there are thousands of people who have a higher purchasing power. That means a lot more money will be spent in local businesses, shopping centers, car dealerships, etc. It will more evenly be distributed among the masses. It will also be taxed which means more money for government assistance programs and infrastructure, and all the other bullshit government spends on. It seems to me that this is more about ego and precedent than the actual dollar value for these market makers pushing against the squeeze. They stand to lose 11.2 billion, which to us seems like a lot but to them doesn’t even amount to a drop in the bucket. Long story short I think common sense says this will galvanize our economy.

GME continues to be a Carollian experience. Through this looking-glass, there is a world where stock prices do not reflect the value of the underlying companies whose partial ownership is traded through common stock. To some, the market is, more or less, broken, for now. That's not a good or a bad thing. The market mechanism is not supposed to make an implicit judgment. There is information in price, but that information is difficult to divine and interpret. Markets aren't good, bad, rational or irrational: they just are.

  When one group takes action in a market to alter the playing field, the market is not a pure market anymore. It's lost 'integrity' and loses more with every modification. This typically only happens in moments of crisis or technological change: countries ban short-selling, for instance; exchanges will unwind clear 'fat-finger' trades, etc; speed bumps may make the market more 'fair' for the technologically behind. We're learning more about how markets can have what appear to be 'unintended' consequences (flash crashes, GME-style reverse crashes), or can be 'gamed' (spoofing, quant as a whole), but we're back to square one: markets don't have feelings. The rules are simple: post your price, the amount, and the rest is order-matching. All of the rest are modifications against the spirit of the laws of the jungle.
  
So, like you, I'm disgusted by what happened the other day. My guess is the DTC and others required incremental collateral for clearing any GME trades--this required RH to raise capital. I actually don't think RH is to blame here! Every broker did the same thing, so there must be a root cause. I mentioned something like this may happen the other day, and I repeat my admonition to not trade on margin. I suspect GME long buying will require 100% margin at virtually any broker. Brokers have to protect themselves, but they can be influenced by the rest of the parties in their food chain, as we saw.

  GME is still worthless compared to its current price. Keep that in mind. You're buying a flower, a baseball card, a beanie baby, a photocopy of a Picasso, all for prices that you know are a lot more--not just a lot more, but insanely more--than anything close to what it could be worth. Those are the facts: GME is just a shitty retailer that will struggle to survive, let alone become a business worth 20 or 30 billion dollars. All of the Ryan Cohen transformation stuff is BS relative to the price change. A good team may be able to turn around GME to the point where it is worth $40, MAYBE. It'll never be worth $300, or at least, the probability that GME operations could support a reasonable price like that is about as small as my odds of becoming a MLB starting pitcher.
 
 That doesn't mean the stock can't go up. The world is conflating what a market is by trying to assign it implicit judgment. Traders have the right to buy and sell anything they'd like for any price that they'd like. One man's ""bubble"" is another man's ""deep value."" I bought a rap CD for millions of dollars. That's my right. Did I overpay? Well, that's really not a judgment anyone can make, is it? If I paid $10,000,000 for a baseball card which is well-known to trade for $5, then it seems clear I've overpaid, right?
  
No. Speculators buy assets for many reasons. Sometimes its because they're making a value judgment: this is WORTH more than my purchase price. But what does that imply? What is worth or value? Most speculators (I suppose you can define that as a buyer who has an explicit intention to sell at a later date, probably soon) buy things because they are confident they can sell at a higher price soon. The value judgment is secondary, and sometimes not relevant at all. Speculators are the animating spirit of the market. If you curb the ability for speculators to act, you have a farcical excuse of a market. But, you can't blame a clearing broker for saying, ""what happens if your client can't clear this trade?"". The stock just went from 300 to 150--what if your client is broke? To me, the simple answer there is to require 100% margin. Limiting the ability for someone to buy a stock for 100% margin (literally the cash to cover the trade is set aside) smells awful. I wouldn't bother with conspiracies--they won't help you trade well.
  
Many of you are brand new to the world of trading. I've traded my whole life--it is very, very hard. I am not very good at it, to be frank. I do think I'm a very good value investor, and in biotech, an extremely good binary-event trader. 99% of people, including in finance, are not good traders. 99% of people are not good 'value' investors, either. That doesn't mean you shouldn't want to become one or try. But it is inordinately difficult. There's nothing wrong with hobbies or 'side gigs', but I really think you should think about the market like a professional sport, or fighting/boxing league, where you are permitted to 'play with the pros'. It doesn't make too much sense to 'part time' fight Brock Lesnar or take LeBron 1-on-1. But this is what you're doing when you trade. Be careful.
  
For those newish to trading, here is my advice on some reading materials:

1) Market Wizards series. This is one of the best series on great investors/traders, which takes you into the mind of the successful trader, in their words. It's always by the same author (JS), too, who is very experienced and knowledgable.
    
2) Trading to Win by Ari Kiev. Read it. Probably the best book on the theory of trading ever written.
    
3) AVOID most books on trading. Unless there is a reason to read them that you can really digest, they're probably empty wastes of time at best, or at worse, could mislead you into some terrible strategy. You can't go wrong reading the books by or about people who have made fortunes in the market. But always take everything as a grain of salt. AVOID the opinions of others in general. This sounds self-referential, but will make a little bit more sense after reading 1/2.
  
When you read these books, you'll realize that my life of 'value investing' is basically irrelevant to the near-term of the stock market, especially in situations like GME or TSLA. GME will probably go down over time, as I mentioned, because it is wildly overvalued and, generally, wildly overvalued stocks tend to go down over time. That doesn't have to be true. That's why investors diversify and 'stop-loss' and do other things to protect themselves. You should do all of that, too. My style, and those of others, simply relate the price of something to the amount of cash it can generate. That's value investing in a nutshell, and it is what the entire industry of Private Equity (Blackstone, Apollo, Carlyle, etc.) is all about. Hedge Funds and Mutual Funds do a little of this as well, but to decide whether a stock will go up or down is this dark art called 'trading'. The ""next"" Steve Cohen might be being born right here, right now, in WallStreetBets. Who knows.
  
I still think GME will trade at 1,000. Why? I am guessing, like all of you, and every other trader out there. No one knows anything. As I mentioned, the borrow interest rate is what I think is important to watch. You're at a disadvantage to other traders in that respect: hedge funds can pull up that information through phone calls, contacts, etc. which you are hopeless to compete against. It doesn't mean they're going to make money and you won't. It's just something to think about. I like 1,000: it's a big round number that is meaningful in the psychology of the markets, to a very small extent. It may trade there for 5 seconds, or it may trade there and keep going higher. For some reason, I think the stock has a bit of ""destiny"" to go there. I may be 100% wrong. As I said, to the extent I have any skill at all, it's generally in being able to predict the value of stocks of companies (and other assets) many years from now, and in biopharma, if anywhere. 
  
I hope everyone does well, and even is being entertained, by all of this. Just make sure that if you have a massive gain in GME, that you 'take something off the table'. Don't be greedy. Some of this money is life-changing. Even if it is 10% of your position, book some kind of gain. It will feel good. Be objective. Don't use margin--you may lose more than you can afford. I've been there. It sucks balls worse than you can imagine. Don't do it for GME, even if RH or anyone else lets you. Don't go too crazy with options, even if they let you. I hope you all are able to buy Wu-Tang albums, tendies, autism treatment and whatever else your hearts desire at the 'end' of this, whatever that means. 
  Good luck WSB, I love you!

Be on guard for them to try to flash crash GME at 3:59.

I recently read, that RH was restricting sales to 1 share and the UK broker turning off buys.  This seems to a tactic to silo off buys.

RH will likely turn off all buys soon.

I'm concerned that they may plan to flash crash it at 3:59pm.  If you've considered buying in, consider buying /setting a limit order at **3:45pm EST**

So if you don't have a RH account, put in a limit order at 3:59pm to buy 1 or more share at a price you're comfortable with, if you want.  This will provide a huge bid wall in front of the them, in case the pummel the order flow with low asks.

**Edit:  From Note1, I would argue that it would be better to set a limit order around 3:45pm in case they try to do a halt. see Note.**

**If this was informative. Tell 2 friends and tell them to tell 2 friends. pass it on.**

Note:

""Just wanted to add to your post that **like yesterday they may try the flash crash 5 min before end. The volatility halt will kick in, (as it did yesterday at 15:59:41), so we had no chance of getting it up in those last 19 seconds.** If they are hovering 10%+ above 115, 150, 200 with ten min to go, we know that will be their plan - **and 15:50-15:54 will be crucial to get out of the 10% trap""**

Brokerage firms put stop to your ability to buy new positions on GME AMC NOK BB but allowed people to keep selling. They seem to be deflecting when asking why the option to sell was still available by making it seem as if it was the perk they allowed us to keep. In doing so many people sold and were unable to buy back causing the stocks to plummet. This was a fabricated demand shortage 📈 with which brokerages were allowed enough time to call on other multi-billion dollar institutions to help cover their positions. 

Now things are at the point where it seems that on most if not all platforms you can only make limited purchases but still unlimited sales. This seems to be the same tactic from yesterday but on a smaller scale. It’s a fabricated demand shortage effectively slowing momentum. These brokerage firms have also begun limiting people’s instant deposit availability.

All of these tactics don’t amount to anything if people stay the course. Keep your eyes on the moon and beyond 🚀 🌕🪐👩‍🚀

Be on guard for them to try to flash crash GME at 3:59.

I recently read, that RH was restricting sales to 1 share and the UK broker turning off buys. This seems to a tactic to silo off buys.

RH will likely turn off all buys soon.

I'm concerned that they may plan to flash crash it at 3:59pm. If you've considered buying in, consider buying /setting a limit order at **3:45pm EST**

So if you don't have a RH account, put in a limit order at 3:45pm to buy 1 or more share at a price you're comfortable with, if you want. This will provide a huge bid wall in front of the them, in case the pummel the order flow with low asks.

**Edit: From Note1, I would argue that it would be better to set a limit order around 3:45pm in case they try to do a halt. see Note.**

**If this was informative. Tell 2 friends and tell them to tell 2 friends. pass it on.**

Note:

""Just wanted to add to your post that **like yesterday they may try the flash crash 5 min before end. The volatility halt will kick in, (as it did yesterday at 15:59:41), so we had no chance of getting it up in those last 19 seconds.** If they are hovering 10%+ above 115, 150, 200 with ten min to go, we know that will be their plan - **and 15:50-15:54 will be crucial to get out of the 10% trap""**

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here’s a trick that will work.

1) Go to Feb 5 option.
2) Scroll all the way down the call list
3) Buy GME call option with the cheapest +x.xx%
4) Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let’s get them!!!

P.S. If you can afford 100 shares but can’t afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.

_This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY. You can lose 100% of anything you invest._

EDIT:

1) This works for pretty much any stock.

2) There’s a catch. You need enough money (please don’t use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.

Example:

- $GME is $300
- The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000
- Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000).
- Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)

You could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185640.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'P', 'S', 'NOT', 'ONLY', '$GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

For some reason the media has been presenting this like we are 'targeting' wall street on some sort of holier than thou crusade reversal of fortune thing. Guess what. We aren't.

Think the wolf of wall street, those are our aspirations.

**If retail had shorted 220% of GME's float we would be squeezing them just as hard**

Sure, its funny to take down some stuck up fund managers, but thats a side bonus. We make fun of Citron because Andrew Left got his wife stolen by a green energy billionaire, we make fun of Melvin cuz they tried to short a meme stock.

We have shorted plenty of stocks. Nobody cares. Last year we all made a killing riding the markets down while the normies lost their jobs and lived off stimmy checks. We ride the trends in whichever direction they point. The markets are a zero sum game. Welcome to the club.

But anyways, we owe you a thank you I suppose. Without you getting super jazzed for the 'revolution' we would have never had the capital to squeeze like we did. You may hate millionaires but you certainly made a ton of new ones this week.

&#x200B;

GME has only about 65 million shares available in the market (free-float), that means, you can trade an unlimited amount with derivatives like CFDs, but there's a real scarcity on the main asset, in this case the stock.

&#x200B;

We are about 6 million users here, this means that, if each user buys 10 stocks of GME, more than the 85% of the free float shares are going to be assigned, and in this case, it's going to create a problem for closing short-selling positions, since the users are going to be determining the final price to buy again the stock in order to close the trade. (Remember, scarcity is the word here.)

&#x200B;

Don't you know what this means? I'm not telling to hoard the market and manipulate the order-book, but do the mental math. WALL STREET BETS WON, we are going to be the ones deciding when this craze is going to end, and this is a victory for retail traders, if we want, we could sweep the market.

&#x200B;

Remember that Goerge Soros did something similar to the GBP, if you pressure enough the market you are going to find out where it lacks liquidity.

I've commented before about what trash this company is, and what trash their fucking app. is.

This is the equivalent of telling you that now you're only allowed to sell, not buy, because Citadel got on the wrong side of these trades when you made them.

Robinhood does not send your trades to the exchange.  They send them directly to Citadel or one of three or four other market makers.  You're betting directly against Robinhood when you use it.  They clear their own trades.

It's a total sham, and they are exactly the antithesis of what they bill themselves as.  They are designed for these big money players to make money, and for you to lose.

Get a fucking Fidelity account.  They send your trade to the exchange, and pay for that.  They don't get paid for order flow.

If you note, there were insane volumes during closing, but price remained steady. Because when the hedgecunts where manipulating it to go down and crash, several people found out the technique to buy excercisable calls with almost no premium.

We bypassed the ban on buying more shares and were able to keep the momentum going above 320.

We won the battle, and are well on our way to win the war. Since it closed above 320, millions of calls will be exercised and the gamma squeeze has officially begun. All we have to do now is HOLD. Just chill during this weekend for we have a war to win next week.

I don't know if the technique will work on Monday, and if it does, anyone looking to buy 100 shares or more can do it. Remember to remove stop losses, and set limit higher than 1,000$

However, 4 of those 5, the class  lead is a Plaintiff that didn't own shares of the affected stocks and  were people who were forbidden from buying them.  They essentially  boiled down to a person searching for a stock, not being able to find  it, and claiming damages from that.  Only one of the 5 - the one filed  in the 10th Circuit, District of Colorado - is led by a Plaintiff who  was actually IN these equities, sold some shares after the restriction  occurred, and has actual tangible damages as a result of the trading  platforms.  As a result of this and the fact that this is the only one  that is suing more than just Robinhood (it's also going after all the  major trading platforms, Apex and Citadel), it's highly likely that this  particular one is the one all the other class actions are going to get  rolled into, even though the New York one was filed first.  It's also  the only one of the 5 led by a firm that specializes in class action.

I've  been in contact with the lead in this case (I'm backing it, in fact), and the firm is looking for  all other people who have demonstrable losses and damages as a result  of RH, TDA, Schwab et al's actions as they compile their opening salvo.

The  firm representing the action in the 10th Circuit is the Hannon Law  Firm, and the case is being speared by founder Kevin Hannon.

For a second, let’s just imagine there are only 100 shares total of GameStop.

This means that person A owns 100 shares. Person B is a short seller and borrows them, sells them to person C who buys them. At this point the stock is 100% short.

Person C then lends those shares to Person D who is a short seller who then sells them to person E who buys them.  The stock is now 200% short. 

Person E lends 50 of them to person F who is a short seller who sells them to person G who buys 50. The stock is now 250% short

So now person A, C, and E all own the same 100. The brokerage sights are limiting buying because they are attempting to unwind that! If everybody right now demanded their shares. The brokerage sites should be on the hook for $34.5 Bil worth of stock that doesn’t exist.

That’s fucked up but here’s where it gets crazy. 

There were never any controls on monitoring if somebody’s shares had been sold short twice. 

When a short seller sells shares. They are immediately paid. So cash is in their accounts. 
When a person buys shares they pay money out and theoretically own shares. But because the short selling wasn’t tracked brokers do not possess the shares they were putting into the market. If everyone were to request their shares they would default on their obligations and fold. Meaning they only have 100 shares and person A, C, and E all have a claim to those shares. Meaning the buyers are left fighting over who has shares. And the short sellers are left holding the cash they collected. 

It gets super messy. 

If Robinhood were to default. Short sellers win. Then most likely the fed has to come in and save the buyers spending tax dollars. That’s why the fed is getting involved.

By limiting shares and removing the ability to continue to short, they are trying to unwind this mess without it causing a panick.

That is why the broader market is down. 

Not because of shorts covering... but because of the potential for brokerages to collapse. 

I’m guessing Robinhood, TD, IB, and E-Trade are on the hook for a vast majority of the shares that don’t actually exist but multiple people own.

Imagine if person A says he doesn’t want to lend his shares.  The broker and clearing house has to figure out how to balance person B-G sourcing shares from somewhere else.

If the brokerages don’t go under. Short sellers, the hedge funds, are on the hook. 

If they do go under... economic recession. 

Retail investors once again left holding the bag.

Institutions don’t use these little guys. They use IB to trade and then they have the physical shares transferred into accounts at 5/3rd. If IB were to go under their fund would be fine. But most brokerage accounts are only insured up to up to $250k.

This is a failure of the system as a whole. This is a problem created by the top .001% and they are trying to call it a Reddit rebellion. Fuck that. 

This is totally a short selling fault. I think the outcome of this is that short selling gets banned.

Edit: Changed we to they, our to their. I’m not a hedge fund manager I’m a retail retard like the rest of you who just wanted to spread some information.

\- \[[https://youtu.be/knrlijBR4MQ](https://youtu.be/knrlijBR4MQ)\]([https://youtu.be/knrlijBR4MQ](https://youtu.be/knrlijBR4MQ))

\- This is the 17 minute long YouTube video along with interview with Webull CEO Anthony Denier who provided supporting evidence to everything I claimed.

&#x200B;

💎 🙌 💎 🙌 💎 🙌 💎 🙌 💎 🙌 💎 🙌

&#x200B;

\> TL;DR → Melvin Capital fucked up so bad that they were about to destroy the entire market through counter party risk leading to a massive liquidity crisis. Since Melvin and other hedge funds were too big to fail, to prevent a complete market collapse, DTC had to screw the clearing firms (who then had to screw brokers who then had to screw retail) by raising settlement collateral from 3% to 100%. This led to a tricke down effect which shutdown $GME trading (and a few others) and then drove prices low enough that Melvin Capital wouldn't collapse and take the entire securities market with it.

&#x200B;

Basically, Melvin Capital over-leveraged and was about to destroy the entire market. DTC couldn't let that happen. Thus, DTC forced retail traders to bail out Melvin Capital through a series of trickle down events that started with                                                                     DTC raising settlement collateral on $GME from 3% to 100%.

&#x200B;

In short, Melvin fucked up big so DTC forced you to bail them out.

&#x200B;

\# 1. Background Information

&#x200B;

\### How trading works behind the scenes

&#x200B;

1. DTC (Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation)

\- Monopoly that helps settle funds from trading

\- Traditionally funds take two days to settle

\- Purpose → Provide liquidity in the meantime

\- Makes sure sellers get their money when they sell

\- BUT usually requires 1-3% collateral just in case

2. Clearing Firms (APEX Clearing)

\- Intermediatery between DTCC and Brokers to clear trades

\- Pays collateral to DTCC until trade settles

3. Brokers (Robinhood, WeBull)

\- Facilitate securities exchange between traders

4. Traders

&#x200B;

\# 2. Why Was $GME Trading Halted?

&#x200B;

\### DTC without warning raised collateral from 3% to 100%

&#x200B;

\### What stocks were affected?

&#x200B;

\- $GME, $AMC, $KOSS

&#x200B;

\### What is the impact?

&#x200B;

\- Clearing Firms now have to hand over \*\*100% cash collateral\*\* to DTC for \*\*every single trade\*\*

\- AND hundreds billions of dollars are traded constantly, how can Clearing Firms handle 100%?

\- ANSWER: Clearing firms obviously CANNOT provide the required collateral

\- RESULT: Clearing firms called up the brokerages and told them to shutdown trading

\- Ex. Robinhood shutdown all selling of $GME and other volatile securities

\- Did DTC know this was going to happen? Hell yeah. They did it on purpose.

&#x200B;

\# 3. Why DTC Suddenly Required 100% Collateral

&#x200B;

\### The entire securities market was about to collapse.

You heard that right.

&#x200B;

\### What how?

&#x200B;

\- If $GME prices kept going up, Melvin Capital would be unable to pay and cover their shorts

\- Then it would trickle down to the Clearing Firms who would be on the hook

\- But we are talking about BILLIONS of dollars here

\- So Clearing Firms would be in the water and not have enough

\- Meaning, if you sell a share, you won't receive a penny because NO ONE CAN PAY

\- Result → Counter party risk → Complete market breakdown

&#x200B;

\### It gets worse...

&#x200B;

\- Clearing Firms being underwater would cause a domino effect to the ENTIRE MARKET

\- Remember, Clearing Firms help clear pretty much every security traded

\- So if Clearing Firms goes under due to $GME...

\- Then not a single security on the marketplace could be cleared

\- \*\*The entire market would collapse\*\*

&#x200B;

\### Case Study: 2008 Financial Crisis

&#x200B;

\- Remember Lehman Brothers? They were also a clearing firm.

\- Lehman was the clearing firm for many other hedge funds

\- When Lehman collapsed, the hedge funds it supported \*\*also became counter party risk\*\*

\- Result?

\- \*\*Complete market breakdown\*\*

\- Which is why the U.S. Government had to come and \*\*bail them out\*\*

&#x200B;

\# 4. Who's Responsible / Who to Blame

&#x200B;

\### So fuck DTC right? Not really.

&#x200B;

\- You have to understand...

\- \*\*DTC only had two choices\*\*

1. Leave everything as it is and let the market collapse

2. Screw the $GME holders to protect the rest of the market

\- Can't really blame them...

&#x200B;

\### Then who do we blame?

&#x200B;

\- \*\*MELVIN CAPITAL and other hedge fund shorts\*\*

\- Their greed almost collapsed the U.S. securities exchange market (potentially global as well) because they over-leveraged and shorted 140% of $GME float.

\- They made a horrible call trying to profit off of a struggling business with insane leverage.

&#x200B;

\### But who does Wall Street blame?

&#x200B;

\- \*\*Wall Street blames Retail Traders and r/WallStreetBets\*\*

\- Their reasoning → If everyday folks didn't discover our evil and irresponsible strategies, this never wouldn't have happened."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185649.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['CEO', 'I', 'DR', 'DTC', '$GME', 'DTC', 'DTC', 'DTC', '$GME', 'DTC', 'DTC', 'BUT', 'APEX', 'DTCC', 'DTCC', '$GME', 'DTC', '$GME', '$AMC', '$KOSS', 'DTC', 'AND', 'ANNOT', '$GME', 'DTC', 'DTC', '$GME', 'LIONS', 'NO', 'ONE', 'CAN', 'PAY', 'NTIRE', 'ARKET', '$GME', 'U', 'S', 'DTC', 'DTC', '$GME', 'ELVIN', 'PITAL', 'U', 'S', '$GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'KOSS', 'GME', 'GME', 'PAY', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

What you won't find here are political discussions, self-promotion, and other nastiness is not related to our single and most important goal: making money.

#**And we've got you!**

The community here is incredible. Each and every one of you make this place great and better than it was the day before. 

For those who have been around for a while, please reach out and help the newcomers. For those who are new, please don't hesitate to ask questions and get involved. 

From the bottom of my heart, thank you for being here.

Why do you keep doubling down on your short positions? Why are new hedge funds are coming in and scooping up new short positions? What the fuck are you shitstains on society doing? What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you understand who we are?

We don’t fucking play here. We lose money for fucking breakfast. Every day. And then we come back and lose even more fucking money. We buy out of the money weeklies on fucking THURSDAYS. We don’t give a fuck. This is what we do. We do this. We don’t fucking play around. We come here to risk it all. We come here to YOLO our children’s college funds away just to post memes about it.

Your plan was really just to put us in a position where all we have to do is hold SHARES? Say less fam. I haven’t owned a share in four years. I sold AAPL AMD and ENPH calls last week just to buy shares of GameStop and fuck you up as much as possible so we can make memes about it.

We know you will. And because we know you will, we are going to make you do it. Just like the coyote blindly chasing the roadrunner off of a fucking cliff.

Listen up retards, because nobody gets the luxury of an intel brief like this. This isn’t AskReddit. Some people’s kids aren’t going to eat as well because of this movement, some of your kids. A lot of you are brand new to being exposed this way, and being sensationalized into doing it harder and faster than you ever would’ve. The people who control the game are salivating over this. Learn these 3 lessons as fast as possible, I’m not saying they will save you money, but they might save you from being blindsided by reality.  

1. WallStreetBets does not care about you. You are nobody. Occasionally a person accomplishes enough to be recognizable, but it’s such a small fraction it’s negligible. You are completely and utterly alone in this game. The times that this subreddit has served as a haven for confirmation bias in times of uncertainty are the times that the most people have walked away with horrible losses. 

2. Nobody is a prophet. Nobody here is powerful enough to make plays with 100% certainty. The majority of prophets and astrologists here have ended up major losers and hated by the community. 

3. Only putting in what you can afford to lose is a fairy tale, the only ‘unrealized losses’ are the losses you haven’t realized you’re not getting back yet, and there’s no such thing as only playing with house money. Any “unrealized” gains are YOUR dollars, not the house’s anymore. And you could spend years convincing yourself you could afford to lose what you lost. That’s if you don’t pick up an addiction on the way and lose more. 

Welcome to the casino. Oh and in a week, it’s back to date and strike. For now-

Good luck. 24@353 🚀 holding"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185654.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['A', 'YOUR']|[]

I see a lot of people shitting on AMC for being framed a ""scape-goat"" for GME shorts to divert us from GME.

There is no doubt that short squeeze is apparent in GME but let me explain why AMC shorts can also get FUCKED by recent events.

&#x200B;

# 1. AMC Has a High Short Interest % [https://www.highshortinterest.com/](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)

AMC is #2 on the list with a whopping 78.97% of float being shorted. and looking at the % held by institutions( 37.24% ) and assuming that these institutions are long on the stock, we're looking a short to float percentage of about **116.21%.**

Yes it's still lower than GME's 200 something % but 116% is still very, VERY high.

If this is not enough to cause a short squeeze I don't know what will.

# 2. AMC Got 2 Big Unexpected News.

Just like how Ryan Cohen's involvement has started this crazy investing phenomena, AMC has also receive a bunch of unexpected news that caught the ears of boomer investors.

Recently it has received a lot of funding to not go bankrupt and even wiped off their debt by diluting shares. This was a great move as many investors will be looking forward to hop in for brighter prospect of the company. Plus with the vaccines being released AMC will get back on their feet in no time. Also, since they recently raised money by diluting shares and wiping away their debt, there won't be more share dilution in the near future.

Lastly, with the whole GME scandal, it received soooo much coverage on media and the public  which is only going to hurt the shorts.

# 3. New Shorts are In The House

If you look at [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/amc](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/amc) and [https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc](https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc) The shares available to short has gone down significantly. JUST 4 days ago the short availability was at **7 million** and now this morning it went all the way down to **500**(0 on fintel).

This means a lot of shorts possibly jumped in due to the recent jump in the stock price. However, what they don't realize is that this is an unprecedented time where millions of retailers are buying the stock to HOLD...because they like the stock. Not to bring down corrupt hedge fund fuckers of course.

# 4. GME Steam Has Cooled Off a Bit

I know I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this last point but, personally, I think GME has potentially gone up to a point where retailers are not hopping in as much because of the high stock price but the ones who already got in are holding/adding to force the shorts to cover. This could explain why it really hasn't moved all that much in the past 2 days(except when it went down to like $132) despite people saying there will be a gamma squeeze today.

AMC is sitting at $13.00 as of now and it is at a relatively more ""desirable"" price for normal people to hop in. Psychologically it FEELS better to hold 30 stocks than 1 stock.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm not suggesting you should sell GME and buy AMC but I can see about 5x return on AMC and about 3x return on GME in the near future. and I like to make more money so my money goes to AMC. I can write about how I got those 3x and 5x but that's for next time.

&#x200B;

Upvote so more people can see!

Articles have started to trickle down on Reddit and other social media platforms trying to explain how this is a bad idea and justify the actions of Robinhood and other brokerage firms. The apologist is coming out in force trying to put out the flames and cool everyone off because it’s the weekend. 

Don’t allow yourselves to be fooled. You are all now an alchemist. You turn shit 💩 stocks into gold 💰.

Consider avoiding firms that use Apex Clearing Corp.|t3_l87rwj|0.99|281|281|top|2021-01-30 02:29:48.000000|DutchBookOptions|137|Discussion|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87rwj/psa_moving_from_robinhood_consider_avoiding_firms/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87rwj/psa_moving_from_robinhood_consider_avoiding_firms/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87rwj/psa_moving_from_robinhood_consider_avoiding_firms/|"Brokerages must use a custodian to clear all trades. Many brokerages use Apex Clearing Corp., which informed their clients this week that trades in GME and AMC (among others) would be restricted to closing-only. Brokerages that use Apex were forced to restrict their clients to closing-only, and had no voice in the matter. (Robinhood, TDAmeritrade, and Interactive Brokers do not use Apex Clearing and were dicks just because they're dicks).

&#x200B;

Firms that use Apex Clearing Corp., and therefore were forced to restrict the purchase of securities this week (and therefore may be forced to do so again in the future) include:

* WeBull
* SoFi
* Tasty Works
* Ally Invest
* M1 Finance
* Betterment
* Firstrade

&#x200B;

Some brokerages have their own clearing companies in-house, including Fidelity and ETrade. By the way, Robinhood makes all of its money by selling its order feed to Companies like Citadel (mainly Citadel). Fidelity is one of the  few brokerages out there which doesn't sell its orders to anyone, ever.

Tasty Works has worked well for me, but since they use Apex, they were forced to restrict the purchase of GME this week and I decided to move to a new brokerage. I created an account with both Fidelity and ETrade to give both of them a shot and this was my experience:

Fidelity:

 \- I filled out the application, but half way through the process I got a server timeout error (presumably because of lots of people doing the same thing as me). I tried again and it worked fine. I also had a question so I called their customer service number. I was on hold for about 3 minutes, then spoke with a real person who was nice and answered my question.

ETrade:

 \- I filled out an application, then got a screen saying that my account creation could not be completed until I called and spoke with a customer service representative. Ok. I called the number on the screen, and waited on hold for 43 minutes (at 8am). I called back later and waited on hold for about an hour and 15 minutes before giving up.

&#x200B;

Extra tidbit regarding Apex:

I tried to submit a Wiki entry for Apex Clearing Corp. last year, but was rejected 3 times because I couldn't provide any acceptable sources. Why couldn't I provide sources for the info? Because you won't find shit about them online which wikipedia considers to be a reliable source, other than on their own site (which was why I was trying to create the wiki page in the first place)."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185710.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'AMC', 'GME']

Clearly it won't have 13 million for long, so we are going to have 5-10 million people flocking to other brokerages.


Someone way smarter than me, feel free to offer your insight, but it seems to me like the brokeragws that get flocked to are going to have the same ""concerns"" Robin Hood had about protecting the little guy and preventing volatility (which is all just lies for actually wanting to protect big money market makers) and start doling out restrictions the same way Robin Hood is.


Cuz I mean that amount of people influx is going to have an effect on these firms risk management... I feel like they are going to slowly make restrictions on retail investing industry-wide.


Anyone with some thoughts to make me feel better?


Seriously, tell me I'm crazy and that it's never going to happen like this, and tell me why






Edit: seriously, somebody make a long, well thought-out response as to why I'm crazy and this is never going to happen.

cuz I absolutely do not want it to happen but it really seems like that's where we're headed and it's terrifying


I mean look at this fucking list

https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/


There's over FIFTY stocks on here!!!!!! And fucking Boomer ones to like not just random obscure Reddit meme stocks.


Go run through that whole thing yourself guys oh, we are being locked out of literally anything that has a catalyst of any kind or anything that has above average trading volume.


It's really fucking terrifying there are big ass fucking names on there... Like why the fuck does GM need to be restricted? Sbux? 



Again, someone please come in here and tell me ""it's just Robinhood, and no other brokerage would ever do this so massively in any event ever, and here is why""


That is what I'm looking for


I know that other brokerages have in some cases been putting restrictions on buying, but it's genuinely been limited to like five or six pure Reddit stocks


But if all of the Robinhood users leave and go to other brokerages, is there a logical cogent argument as to why those other brokerages would never restrict THIS many stocks? And I mean totally unrelated ones....... This is literally retail investors just being blocked from investing there's no other way to put that it's not just fucking troll shit there are again, fucking big ass names on that list

Second edit: I mean that amount of users, 13 mil, even if it's split up into three or four different ways between three or four different brokerages that is going to add a massive amount of risk calculation to every brokerage that just gets fucking in fluxed with straight up millions of people at one time.... You want to talk about volatility?.... I mean again, is there a reason that no one is straight up expecting shit to go fucked up like this?

For this reason I had pre-emptively placed some limit sell orders.

I placed these at levels of someone who LIKES THIS STOCK would make, these were made in Canada on Wealth Simple.  These were approved and moved to my pending orders, these remained all day.  When the market closed and I arrived home, I cancelled to re asses my plan of attack for Monday.

To my dismay I was given an error, Wealth Simple would not let me place new limit sell orders in the similar ranges.

I immediately reached out to their customer service via email, a pop up alerted me it would be 24 hours to hear back, I heard back within an hour.  Here is a clip of what a polite customer service rep gave responded with:

'There is a maximum on how far you can set your limit price as the US executing brokerages will reject any orders too far away from the real price of the US stock or ETF.

Limit orders will be required to have a limit price within 30% of the delayed quoted price to reduce the risk of the orders being rejected by executing brokers.'

SO Wealth Simple - in this time of massive swings, wants us to set limit orders at 30% on their 15 minute lagged price!  Pretty much ensuring I DO not get what I aim to, not only that.. but they currently have a warning about using the MARKET SELL feature for this specific ticker.. however when a stock is moving up so quick, how can you set a limit price of 30%?!

Terrible time to do this, not only that, when I reached out further, they gave me a 'Due to COVID we may not respond for up to 3 days... I bet they are being inundated with frustrated traders..

Good luck trading with a 15 minute lag.. this makes things more difficult (Delayed Quote Price)

Needed to expose this, hoping they will revert or improve the percentage or the limit sell feature is useless in the play I had anticipated.

\-If mods need to see screenshots or emails I have everything, also please weigh in if this is happening to you!  Brokerages playing dirty should be exposed in this time.

&#x200B;

EDIT: THIS IS GME OBVIOUSLY TO THE FUCKING MOON.

&#x200B;

EDIT AGAIN: If you value your users, do not pull this shit in times like these!

I will be transferring OUT OF Wealth Simple and will express my feelings on a REVIEW.  I would encourage anyone who has been similarly effected to do the same (after you sell GME), as it may make the difference. 

 IT'S NOT TOO LATE - CHANGE BACK THIS WEEKEND AND I WILL FORGIVE YOU!

# Transferring from RH to Fidelity

This process is actually very simple.

1. Log on to your Fidelity trading account on a browser.
2. In a different tab, log on to your RH account. Go to your info, and copy your RHS account number. Focus back on the Fidelity tab after copying this number.
3. In the top right of the Fidelity home page, type ""transfer asset"". Click on the link, and you should be in the Transfer of Assets (TOA) page.
4. Click on ""Start a transfer""
5. In the ""Select your current firm"" field, type ""Robinhood"". It should show up as ""Robinhood Securities Llc."". Select that to go to the next step.
6. In the next screen, paste the previously copied RH account number, and select ""individual"" in the account type.
7. In the next screen, you can select a specific equity or the whole account.
8. Wait 2-3 days for your RH account to show nothing, and a day or two after that for everything to pop up on Fidelity.
9. Now, you may shut down the RH account. Make sure you download ALL transactions before you close out the account. Who knows whether RH will even exist by the time it's the next tax filing season.

According to several sources its around 100%. Yahoo finance has it at 122%. Finviz has it at 95%. And Nasdaq has it at 110%.

([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME))

([https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME))

([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings))

Now I know what your smooth brain is telling you. ""How can it be over 100%?"". Well it can be for two main reasons. The first is differences in when companies report their holdings to the SEC, not everyone reports on the same day. The other reason is due to short selling. If institution A has their shares shorted to institution B, then both technically own stock in the company but its being counted twice when reported to the SEC. 

The other question on everyone's mind is, ""How much of the float is still short?"". According S3 Partners market data, after the close today we're still at 113%!!!

([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20))

So how does this all unfold? We've got an army of retards who won't sell for less than $69,420.00, what seems like almost 100% of the float owned by big institutions that can't sell their position all at once  (it's possible they've started selling some of their shares), and still over 100% of the float is short. I really have no idea but it seems like at this point no one who owns a share should have to sell at a loss.

**TL;DR: over 100% of GME float is held by institutions or retards who aren't gonna sell and there is still over 100% of the float being shorted. Flow just handed us the fucking Name Your Price Tool**

When my kids want a game, or for me, we go on https://www.gamestop.com web, find where the game is available and go get it. There aren't any in the dead boomer malls close by, Game Stops are all in anchor strip malls. They are where your local grocery store is. In and out of the store in a few minutes unless we browse. There are no hard pressure sales, but you guys know that. We also now own the game and they can take it to their mom's, grandparent's, where ever without moving the console. I easily spend $600 a year there.



Point is, I'll be utilizing this business model as long as it's available and I'm sure there are many other GenX parents that will do as well.

Downloading games is a cool idea but my ISP starts charging more after around 10gb. Why?

**TL;DR**

&gt;They could potentially to short attack to lower the prices enough that brokers margin call the owners of ITM calls on Monday. You can short the float for 100 shares, essentially making yourself delta neutral to protect yourself, then you get rid of them both on open with full gains.



Price is down $20 AH so be prepared for the morning dip. More scare tactics.

So, if institutional investors want to punish the retail investors they need to do it in a way that the retail investors have trouble countering.

In most cases, they would try to get the strike to where a majority of the open options positions would expire just under the strike with the most interest to keep people from having them executed and making money (in this case, the target would be &lt;$320)

But my theory is, since there is a huge short interest, it's better for the big players to let GME finish above 320 which causes the largest open interest (300, 320) to all get auto-exercised.

Most retail traders don't know how to prevent the auto-exercise, so this causes a bunch of people to buy the stock at 300 and 320 (and various other strikes, under the 325 closing price)

Then they short the price down hard and buy to cover at the lower price in after-hours market, which has much less exposure to the retail investors. Right now the price is down to ~300.

This allows them to gain a profit of ~$20 right now on the execution of those 320s and potentially more, if the price continues to drop.

If the price actually tanks well below 300, this will additionally trigger margin calls Monday morning on the people assigned the shares at 320 and generate maximum profit for the short sellers.

It's too early to determine if this will happen since it would require a hell of a sell-off, but there is clearly an absolute ton of pressure to lower the price after hours to punish those who were holding 300 and 320 calls.

To give a more concrete example of how to manipulate the price:

HF buys GME when it dipped under $150.

HF sells GME 320 calls after it goes back up, for $$$$

Market pins GME at 325 at expiry, forcing auto assignment of 320s

Instead of allowing the cheap GME to be called away, they force the price down after hours.

They buy shares to cover their short calls at a discount, since they will get $320 for them.

Price was bouncing pretty hard between 300-320, but creeping back over 320 now. Should be quite interesting to see if it holds.

I am by no means an expert but within this year I will tell you I’ve been up 30-50k and then had it whipped away. This way of gambling to me is one of the few ways out of this crazy society we deem normal and okay. I will either die poor trying or die a legend like deepvalue. The biggest lesson is hold your positions the moment you get scared and sell an option or a stock I promise you it’s like magic it goes up and that pain hurts like no other.

**Reasons you might want to disable your share lending settings include:**

1. You don't want to lend your shares to people trying to short your stocks
2. You think the person/entity loaning your stock may not return them
3. You're not being compensated well enough for putting your securities at risk

These programs are complex and highly variable depending on your broker. Without getting into all the details now just now, you should be aware of the most common types of lending:

* Brokers reserve the right to lend out securities bought on margin (in other words, with borrowed money from your broker). **To avoid this type of lending, don't buy stocks on margin.** As far as I know, this is the case for all brokers that offer margin accounts. (However if you have explicit confirmation to the contrary from your broker, feel free to provide it here!)
* Most brokers can ALSO lend out your fully-owned shares. Brokers will do one of the following:

1. Lend out **fully-owned** shares purely based on the **type of account** you have (e.g., Margin account type). The only solution in this case is switching account types. Example: Degiro
2. Lend out **fully-owned** shares **regardless of account type** (even Cash accounts).
   1. Some brokers **allow you to opt-out**. Example: Webull
   2. Some brokers **do not allow you to opt-out**. Your only recourse to avoid lending is switching brokers. Example: M1 finance
3. Lend out **fully-owned** shares in a Margin account, and giving you a **portion of the profits**.
4. Some combination of the above, with option #3 becoming available at a certain account NAV. Example: Fidelity
5. None of the above (i.e. no lending - less common) Example: Vanguard

Please also include your source (either a URL or exact words that someone from support told you about that broker's lending programs)."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185716.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'A', 'RBC', 'RH', 'TD', 'ISA', 'I', 'ALSO', 'NAV', 'URL']|['RBC', 'NAV']

I have been in the fucking game for about seven years now. 

I don’t typically do posts like this and so this is fucking new to me. Anyways, it seems like a shit ton of you are falling out of favor with NOK. I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with you if you expected to gain a shit ton of money in a day, but what the fuck I have never seen such 🧻🤲🏻 in my fucking life for the past two days. 

Are you guys really just going to stand there and let the enemy beat the fuck out of us. 

And of course some of you are going to mention the total float as if that fucking matters because the stock is still cheap as fuck (for now lol 🚀) and because we managed to trade one fucking fifth of all the NOK stocks in circulation. They literally had to stop our asses from buying a couple of times. Just like you autistic retards I have lost thousands of dollars in this shit. My paychecks, birthday money, dividends, money from the sale of blue chips and Ark ETFs, etc.

So where’s the upside? Well let me fucking tell you where the upside is and when you can expect to pull off the biggest fucking heist alongside GME and AMC Wall Street will have ever seen. 🔥🚀💸

NOK is well known to be the bigger beast when it comes to the BANG stocks (BB, AMC, NOK, GME). It has a fuck load of shares to go around and there’s a lot of paperhanded pussies out there, so I understand why it may be daunting to expect a Juggernaut like NOK to moon anytime soon. 

But it doesn’t have to be. 

NOK releases its earnings on Thursday and its expected to blow the competition out of the fucking water. I wouldn’t even be surprised at all if it were to get a higher price than ERIC in two weeks (hell, possibly by EOW). NOK even plans to merge with top tier companies in the near future due to their prowess in the 5G tech that they’re developing. The 🏳️‍🌈🐻 have had their big meaty claws ever since its ATH of $62 all those years ago. Do you really expect a change if you don’t fucking BUY and fucking HOLD. No, with a team of fucking retarded  superstars in this sub, NOK is prepping for a fierce comeback in the upcoming weeks. GME is top dog right now, but let’s be honest. GME hype can’t last forever (even tho it can for a long time as long as we remain retarded). However being on team NOK makes me feel like I’m on a loosing, shitty ass baseball team and no one is hitting over .100

What’s the plan, Stan?

The fucking plan is that you don’t buy market price. You look at the ask price and you fucking buy it. This is how we destroy walls. The $5 barrier battle today was hard fought and we fucking lost to the hedge funds. This next week is going to be fucking spectacular 🪄🚀🤲🏻💎 and I need to know if my fucking NOKle heads are even in it to win it or just downright frauds. 

You say NOK was a plan by the bots? Take a look at fucking BlackBerry. That shit took the same swerves NOK did that it’s pretty much identical. If NOK is a sham, then the idea of the BANG stocks is a sham. 

I know for a fucking fact you don’t believe that. I know that there’s dreamers in this sub. I dream just like you. I am trying to build a life just like you guys are. We are in something way bigger than ourselves so if you can for ONCE IN YOUR LIFE consider that maybe that the process is a trustable process then maybe we can win this shit.

If NOK hits $50, I will literally buy new fucking silverware (like expensive handmade shit with sterling silver cutlery) and eat my own shit. I don’t give a fuck whether you’d want to see it or not, because honestly boys I’d eat my shit to go to the moon and I am 200% willing to take one for the team. 

This year, BANG is for real.

So hedgefunds, keep your ears out for the NOK NOK sounds on the door. We’re pissed and we’re armed to the teeth.

EDIT: General cheese reporting. Post this shit everywhere. I dont give a fuck. I WILL be producing a flank strategy tomorrow. People have to know goddamn it. Monday/Tuesday will close at $7 just give it time

The bell doesn’t fucking ring until WSB says it fucking rings. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🥵🥵

EDIT 2: some of you pussies are asking where you can buy NOK. The easiest way to buy it is with that fucking app all the whores on Tinder beg for food money on: Cashapp. There are literally no fucking limits and if you want an extra 2 fucking shares then use this shit when you sign the fuck up and get $10 extra buckaroos: BKXDNGQ. I also want to make it clear that everyone should share their cash apps so that we can get that $10 extra to put into NOK.

You’ve always had an inflated ego, and going to Wharton for an MBA definitely didn’t help in that regard. You interned at GS for the summer of 2003 and told all your friends about it, probably even brought it up oh so casually on dates. When you were hired as a trader by a moderately good to great fund, you probably lost a good deal of friends from your previous life, because they “just don’t get you now.” You’re in a different league than them, even your classmates that now work at lesser funds. You act friendly, liking Facebook posts, returning their calls, but there’s a nagging feeling that they’re holding you back. That you’ve *made it*, and you don’t need some loser that doesn’t even work on the East Coast.

**Jump ahead a few years**

It’s September 20th, 2008. Bear Stearns closed months earlier, Lehman went bankrupt a few days ago. ""Buddies"" of yours from both funds have been texting you, some you know from college. Maybe you’ll take pity on them and put in a good word, maybe you’ll tell them nothing’s available right now and that you’re sorry. You don’t tell them you were part of your fund's effort to short sell theirs into oblivion. Maybe you really are sorry though. What you’re more sorry about, however, is that your bonuses are probably going to be shit for a few years. They could even dip into five figures, god forbid. Your thoughts are of course directed to the millions of people losing their jobs across the country by the news, but inevitably your bonus reduction resurfaces as your biggest concern. “It’s not like I can do anything,” you say, after downing some wine. You go to sleep fairly easily, while across the country, innumerable people are forced to contemplate moving.

**Let’s jump ahead a few more years**

It’s mid-March, 2020. At this point, its become evident that COVID-19 is going to ravage the world, in some capacity (not gonna put politics into this because that’s not the point). As either a CEO or senior executive at a mid-range hedge fund, your thoughts gravitate towards your craft. It’s clear the market is going to tank, so you do what you do best. You short the shit out of several clearly sinking industries (https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/investing/short-sellers-market-coronavirus/index.html). But you don't stop there. You go on CNBC, Fox Business, maybe even the BBC, and announce doom and gloom. Doing this will get people to dump their stocks, meaning your shorts print even more money. Oh well, if there’s a positive to be gained from this whole thing it’s your fund making good money, right? By late March or early April, your wife convinces you that going with the kids to the Hampton’s would be the best choice, since the upper east side is getting a little claustrophobic. You’ll need to cancel your two week St. Barts vacation, what a bummer. You rent out a nice beach house in Sag Harbor for 125k a month, managing to beat out the other bidder by upping them by 10k. Once again, millions of people are losing their jobs, and you’re shorting the companies they work for. What else should you do? 

**Only a few months forward this time**

It’s October. Weeks turned into months, and while you’ve started getting back to the city more and more, you’re still staying in Sag. Sometimes you have family friends over for an ostensibly socially distanced wine + cigar. You don’t think much of the events of the summer, aside from that one tweet you had PR send out in July. Your kids might have thoughts, you haven’t asked. 

**Just a few more months, I promise**

It’s January. For really no other reason than the prospect of making more money, you along with a few other funds have decided to open naked shorts on GameStop. While technically not allowed, there are loopholes. Why would the loopholes be there, if not to be exploited, right? Not like you don’t do the same thing with your taxes.

**Then, the unthinkable happens**

A bunch of retail investors, led by a specific part of Reddit, decide to fuck your position by dramatically raising the share price. Since you firmly believe these people incapable of sticking to such an audacious play, you do nothing. Before long though, you start to become slightly unnerved by how steady the growth of the stock is. It's approaching $100, and you're losing hundreds of thousands to millions every day on short interest. So, you decide to take action. You get on CNBC, and cry about fundamentals. About volatility crushing these people. They don't listen, and keep buying. A week passes with you and your rich friends trying various strategies, none of it working. You're aware of another fund leaning on a popular trading app to force them into not accepting buy orders for GME, amongst others. You're  not above sacrificing pride for money, so you announce your fund has closed its shorts. You're lying, of course. What kind of looks what you get at future parties if you cowed to these people? No, fuck that. You've read all the right books, been to the right schools, made the right friends, networked at the right parties and functions. You will not close, everything in your life has conditioned you not to. In fact, you'll double down. You go on CNBC some more. Artificially lower the stock price by trading between a few other funds. None of it's working, and you're intensely aware of another potential gamma squeeze on Friday. Restrictions on buying help during the day, but after hours, the stock jumps. That momentum carries it into a solid Friday. You won't budge, but at this point you're losing millions of dollars a day. 

**So, here we are**

These people do not care about you. You're the least of their concerns, actually. They care about money and fund image, in that order. We have a real chance to make guys exactly like this hurt where it counts (for them), and I want people to understand that. I'm not saying throw your rent into GME. I'm saying you have the chance to really be a part of something, to screw the people that have been doing the screwing for your whole life. The house has been running a fixed casino, and you have the chance to hit back. 

**Do not close. We have them, and they know it. We're winning, and if we keep winning they will give in.**"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185652.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['CEO', 'MBA', 'GS', 'I', 'CEO', 'CNBC', 'BBC', 'PR', 'I', 'A', 'CNBC', 'A', 'GME', 'CNBC', 'I', 'GME']|['GS', 'BBC', 'GME', 'GME']

This may be only chance for little guys to overcome whales. 



# Stock Market In Its Default

For the past centuries of stock trading, riches had most power on stocks. The idea that a stock can be traded on an expectation basis is a scam where big whales can bait little fish’s money and start devouring on it. You may disagree with me but first let’s consider an example. 

A company makes $100 profit an year. The company IPOs with $1000 market cap. Whales hold 40% of the shares as initial bagholders.

* Case 1: nobody wants to trade the stock.   
If nobody traded any stock, the stock will sit sideways and no-one will gain or lose money. i.e. rich will not gain nor lose money. 
* Case 2: the company is popular and people look to buy at IPO.  
Obviously in this case, stock prices will increase with little guy’s $110, $120 bid until riches start selling their stock at $200. If the stock gets sold back to $100, all of the little guys lost money while whales gained profit even when the stock price(our baseline case) has remained the same. 
* Case 3: the company is performing poorly, and less people want the stock.  
In this case, rich people will sell for $100, $90, $80... and only little guys will buy in the stocks with decreasing stock price. The rich people who initially bought the stock in at $50 or less has still come out of profit while little guys lose money due to the decreasing stock prices. 

See how whales as initial bagholders always win money!

Wait, this is too much math! I don’t get it!  
Don’t worry. I’ll give a simple summary. Whales can initially invest in a company for a way lower price than us. Once the company IPOs they build up their wealth over little guy’s money flooding into the stock. Notice that stock market is ultimately a zero sum game, and odds are in favor of whales who had early invested in the company.


Some may argue the above is false given that more people tend to hold the stock over time with an expectation. Now, here is what is interesting.

* Let's consider a company which doesn't hold any debt or any liquidity. The company is 50% owned by whales. The company IPOs at $100 a share (at 20 PE).  
Notice that company holds no money nor debt. In reality, the company should be valued at 0. But whales who are the initial bagholders of this game can sell their 50% ownership at $100 a share due to the ""expectation"". This is the magic of turning $0 worth company into $100 a share company.
* But what if the company will worth more in 10 years? Then, whales who held onto the stock will be able to sell the stocks at 20PE after 10 years (whether it be $1000 or $10000).

Do you see the game here? The initial bagholders always come out of profit. They are the BANK of this system and will build up the wealth using the little guys. Moreover, the big guys tend to trade on a premature company information which gives them an advantage of early moves.

But, is this bad? NO. It's not a bad thing. It's just how market is built. Just remember, in an ordinary market, little guys will tend to lose money because the market is ultimately a zero sum. The initial investors will always come out better.


# GME, AMC, etc. Case

Now the story gets even more fascinating. In these stocks cases, whales were not the ""initial bagholders"". Instead, they held a short selling position of the stocks. Retails came in and bought the stocks, and became the ""initial bagholders""

Do you remember from the above that initial bagholders always win? This is the case where initial bagholders were the retails. Whales didn't have time to get in or had the priority of getting the pre-IPO shares. Instead, their shorts will print money into the stocks as the move continues. Due to the short selling restrictions, whales who hugely shorted these stocks ""MUST"" continue purchasing the stocks, which will increase the stock prices even further.

We can apply this in a macroscopic view. If we think of GME as a market where one can invest and Citadel as a bank, then this is a case where the bank Citadel is always backing the GME market (unlimited QE) as long as preconditions are met. The precondition here is that share price has to be above the short strike price. Then, the market will only keep growing until the bank has no more money to print. Retails who are now the early investors, or ""initial bagholders"", will be for a first time bagholders of a giantly large market.


# Scenarios

* The best case is when retails continue buying/holding onto the stocks until Citadel's unlimited QE finally ends in the market. As long as the preconditions continue to meet, there will be unlimited QE for the GME market.
* The worst case is when retails panic sell the stocks and the stocks go to bottom. This will allow Citadel to print money from their shorts, and it means that there is no unlimited QE. Only retails were hurt in the case.


# What I am doing

I am a retail myself and will obviously side with retails. I am also very angry especially at the stinky game going on behind the scenes of these trading platforms, and will not forgive them. I will continue HOLDing with my 💎🙌  until everyone🚀🚀🚀 to 🌜🌜🌜🌜

cost-to-borrow shares for the purpose of selling them short — jumped to 29.32% on existing shorts and 50% on new short positions, S3 said. “If most of the shorts had covered, we would not be seeing stock borrow rates at these high levels — by now you would be able to borrow GME stock at single digit levels due to an increase in the lendable stock loan supply due to borrowed shares being returned after all the ‘supposed’ buy-to-covers,” Dusaniwsky said. GameStop remained the most-shorted name in the market as short interest as a percentage of shares available for trading stands at 113.31%, S3 said.

Robinhood has betrayed us. For the year I have commented here (was previously a lurker on an alt account) I have always stuck up for them. You would hear it all the time “switch to a real broker” “Robinhood is shit”. Despite its flaws RH revolutionized trading and many of us would not be where we are today without it, including myself. I have always been a strong advocate for them. But what we have seen the past days is unforgivable and I cannot, in good faith, bring myself to continue using their service.

The smoke is still clearing, and while it seems blatantly obvious that Robinhood has maliciously colluded against us, nothing is clear yet and despite the circumstances I like to give the benefit of the doubt. So I come to you with this proposition. While I see this as very unlikely, unless Robinhood can release proof/statements that a majority of us can agree are sufficient to show their “innocence”...

-We ban Robinhood from WSB. I don’t want to speak for the mods, but I’m sure it would be fairly easy to set up auto-mod so it recognizes screenshots from RH and immediately block them. 

-Of course this theoretical ban would not take place until after the squeeze has squoze.

Shorty is a politically connected trust fund asshole who got into Harvard/Yale on legacy. You never worked a day in your life, but your congressman/hedgefund daddy gets you a job at Citadel because your daddy is friends with the head muckity muck and then you go on to start a long/short hedge fund that invests in fruits. 

You want to buy a shiny apple at $120 thinking it will be $130, but you don't want to just buy a shiny apple with your own money - you want to buy the apple with someone else's money, so you borrow 3 oranges from some reddit retard who thinks you have his best interest at heart. You immediately sell the 3 oranges at $40 a piece to buy a shiny apple at $120. You do this because you think the apple is worth more and will appreciate more, but, you turn into a greedy asshole. You then go on TV and tell everyone that oranges are cancerous to scare people into getting rid of their oranges and bring the price down to $20 so that you only have to pay the reddit retard half of what you sold the oranges for. 

This works for a while. More greedy rich assholes follow your lead and sell to each other to the point where 40 retards sell their 40 oranges to these assholes, who sell to each other, making the total number of oranges borrowed outstanding now 70.

This is ok, as long as the orange is worth less than the apple. You sold 3 oranges at $40 and bought a shiny apple and now the apple is worth 130 and the oranges are worth $20, so you made more than the $10 that increased in the value of the apple (130-20*3=70). 

However, something bad happens - Reddit retards notice not enough oranges exists to cover what you and your friends owe, so they decide to buy up all the oranges to raise the price of oranges. Unfortunately for you, this works. And now, oranges are worth $195... So what is your account worth? Negative.

How? You still owe 3 oranges, just they're now worth $195, and all you have is 1 shiny apple worth $130 to show for it. Your net position on this trade is now worth ($130-$585 = -$455)... Did I forget, that you are also paying 28% interest on the $455, only increasing the amount you owe day after day? You sweat, you panic, you tell your friend at CNBC to tell everyone everything is ok and that you closed your position when you know - you literally can't as you cry and shit yourself and avoid being seen in public as much as you can and keep ignoring you prime brokers phone calls asking for more margin, hoping Robinhood will save you, but they don't, and those oranges are now worth $325 each and its only the first week...

Fuck Robinhood.

Hey GME gang, I've been trying to figure why I'm feeling sour when I'm sitting here on a Friday, enjoying a 10 bagger on my GME plays and a celebratory tumbler of whiskey. It certainly has everything to do with Robinhood--those fuckers sold my $310 call expiring today at 11:09 a.m. PT with no notice, no questions, nothing (you might recognize 11:09 a.m. PT as basically the low point of the day; that option was worth about $10k at 3:55 today) and they sold it for a grand. Thanks, fuckers!

But no, that's not the reason I'm writing this post. I'm writing because I'm pissed off about the screenshot I stole from another post by u/tsukune_surprise. I'm sure we all know about the infamous ladder selling by now that hedge funds use to force down the price to artificial lows. What's eating me up is that, while they certainly employed this bullshit tactic before in our run from $20 to $300+ at present, the results have never been so dramatic as they were today and yesterday. You all know the reason--up until yesterday, WSB and our allies would buy back those shares right away, on the cheap. Now, of course, I'm guessing at least half of our people can't hardly do shit but watch it crash thanks to Robinhood and others who suspended buying in GME.

You can see it plainly in the level two data when ladder selling occurs. To put it bluntly, there are virtually **no buyers and only sellers**. We all know there's no shortage of demand for shares, but the price continues to drop. These fuckers are gaming the system to spite us and if we sit on our hands, there's nothing we can do about it.

So here's the rub: Get off your butt, pick up your phone, log onto your computer, do whatever you have to to #DumpRobinhood and get on a platform that actually supports its people. My portfolio transfer to **Fidelity** is happening as we speak and I hope I'm not the only one. Thanks for reading and stay angry at the powers that be. This is our moment and we can't waste it because of some bullshit app.

Silver is in more demand then ever and the supply will only shrink. In silver highs the price in today’s money would be 600$-1000$. And now it floats at 25$ when the highs in the 80s where in the 50$ range. It is so absurd and if we can all recognize this we truly could take down the entire establishment starting from the hedges down all the way to our corrupted federal reserve that has literally printed most of the money supply in the past year, which in theory should send silver flying to the moon but is being suppressed by the crooks on Wall Street to hide inflation and make you poorer.

TL;DR

BUY SILVER TAKE DOWN THE ESTABLISHMENT, something we all agree on. $SLV should literally be in the high hundreds if not thousands if we can all unite.

It’s becoming clearer and clearer what is coming in the future. As Robinhood restricts purchases on owning more than 1 share in multiple tickers, we can extrapolate why they are pulling every illegal move in the book.

They are out of money. You’ve heard liquidity crisis, well it means they don’t have enough money to pay for our fair legally made gains. Hence the $1 Billion dollar infusion. Decimating the clearing house may restructure parts of the economy, but it was never our fault.

Melvin, Citadel, all these short positions took on a stupid bet. We’ve been taught to never go full retard but that exactly what they’ve been doing, shorting over +100% of the physical shares. Their bad investment cannot be blamed on us small investors just because we bought the stock we like.

Now they’re taking proactive, not reactive measures because they know what is to come. Forcing low prices to scoop up users who’ve invested on margin. Selling to each other to simulate a sell off that will never come. Literally saying you can’t buy the most basic investment, a single share. 

For now, we hold. Everyday we hold, they lose billions. Every day they lose billions due to their own position, we inch closer to the inevitable payout. A payout they can’t afford. If they continue to hold their losing position, what is to come is bankruptcy. The upside is, we can hold this stock longer than they can take on debt.

“We can stay retarded longer than they can remain solvent” is not a joke considering their retarded position.
Here’s some post I stole of some nerd on the internet: 

In this case, collateral requirements on GME went up. Because of its volatility. So while before Robinhood had to pony up collateral for a few shares of GME for every hundred it traded, it now had to, at close of business, pony up one hundred shares' worth of collateral for every hundred it traded. That creates a cash crunch. One that exacerbates itself with every additional trade in the security. If Robinhood fails to satisfy those collateral calls, they go out of business overnight.

So when Citadel and Robinhood can’t pay out, despite telling people to shut up and sell, remember it was never our fault. 

Position: 24 shares of GME, not selling until I see billionaires go homeless for betting against Americans

Enjoy your weekend fucking idiots. Go spend some time with your family.

P.S. And to the SEC, you have a choice. Either restrict Americans from buying a single share on the free market setting a precedent of market manipulation or force shorts to close out some of their mind-numbingly stupid positions just like they did to us.

Edit: I see your concerns about what happens if they bankrupt or the stock plummets. Your cash is insured up to a certain amount $250,000 if a bankruptcy occurs. 
The stock will only plummet if people mass sell, but it’s not happening. The news, the movement all 🚀fuel imo. Don’t sell, we are stronger together. My investment advice has always been, don’t put in anything you can’t afford to lose. That way you are always protected. Thank you for the awards, buy GME."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185649.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['FREE', 'GME', 'A', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'P', 'S', 'SEC', 'I', 'GME']|['FREE', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Hundreds of thousands have joined in and rallied alongside us while others have scolded us for being reckless and harmful and stating that we should be investigated or sued. 

Either way, I think it's fair to say that this has been a once in a lifetime scenario and a lot of us have come upon some money that we didn't expect to have. 

In the spirit of being the smooth brains we are, we still have a lot of work to 💎🤲 until Melvin's wife's boyfriend can't buy the prada bag he wants. But, once the shorts fully cover  and the tendies are secured I think it's only right for us to give back a little because we know how good it feels when the tendies are spread around.

So, I propose that, when the dust settles, the mods set up a way for us to all donate money as a group to some charities or efforts of our choice (maybe we can vote and split funds by percentage). Together we can show that we're not the greedy fucks that we're taking this money from and can raise a lot of money for great causes and I think that's a pretty good way to start off 2021.

If so, then that shit's fucked and fuck them.

These last two days we’ve seen insane backlash against RH, and, on the surface, for seemingly good reason: they restricted our ability to purchase GME among other shares, at a very important time! THEY SUPPRESSED RETAIL DEMAND DURING A SHORT SQUEEZE.

But I don’t think this was a decision they willingly made, nor do I think they made it in defense of the shorters (although it did inadvertently help them).

I’ve read a few things, and correct me if I’m mistaken about any of them, that point to the clearing houses being responsible for RH’s inability to allow its customers to trade. The most recent evidence showcasing over 50+ shares that they’re restricting trading on, clearly indicates RH is experiencing a liquidity crisis. Why? Clearing houses increased RH’s margin requirements while conducting trades in their behalf. Not just RH’s, but many other brokers as well. 

When a trade is made, the clearing house is the intermediary. Let say you want to buy 1k of GME. RH takes your order, and gives it to the clearing house (it goes through citadel too but let’s ignore that for a moment) and the house finds a seller. They match you together, and the clearing house buys (with their own money) the share you want, gives it to you, and gets your money, but not right away. It typically processes for something around 2 days. They provide temporary liquidity to guarantee sellers get their funds immediately, and they require RH to also put up a portion of that temporary liquidity, as collateral (margin).

So what happened? The margin RH was required to put up increased from anywhere from 30% to 100%. That means if you buy 1k of shares, RH used to only need to show 300. Now they have to show 1k. And if they don’t, I assume they end up out of compliance, which leaves them liable to a lot of bad shit.

What happens if RH doesn’t have the liquidity to show 100% margin? They can’t take your trade, because they’d be out of compliance! So they reduce the amount of shares customers can buy to remain within liquidity margins. Same for other brokers as well. It seems really bad with RH however, because now they’ve increased their reduced stock list to companies like Starbucks and GM. Wild. And with all the public backlash, customers are also probably trying to withdraw funds, causing a liquidity crisis feedback loop.

Now here’s the part that worries me, and again, correct me if I’m wrong. RH innovated by allowing retail traders to trade for free, without fees. Their competition was forced to capitulate to these new standards. No fees, means easier trades for retail. Primarily, in the past, retail’s most common trade (and still probably today) were long term holds. If RH goes away, there’s a chance we see a reiteration of trading fees.

There’s also a chance we see more option restrictions on retail as well. The squeezes we’ve been seeing happened, in part, because a purchase of an option causes the seller to go out and purchase shares to cover, in case the option is exercised. The relative price of purchasing an otm option is significantly less than of purchasing the underlying stock itself, but if many options are purchased, much of the stock gets purchased, and we see these types of gamma squeezes. RH enabled this. 

Anyways, positions are GME shares and calls, and of course: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185715.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'RH', 'RH', 'GME', 'THEY', 'ESSED', 'ETAIL', 'EMAND', 'URING', 'A', 'SHORT', 'UEEZE', 'I', 'I', 'RH', 'GME', 'RH', 'RH', 'RH', 'RH', 'I', 'RH', 'RH', 'GM', 'RH', 'RH', 'RH', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GM', 'GME']

I was long GME before the revolt, for sound, logical reasons. I knew retail was hurting because of covid, but the company's valuation was ridiculously low. Only a few hundred mil mkt cap. Dirt cheap. I traded it from 6 to 7. Then from 9 to 12. Made a day trade for a few hundred bucks. 
Then wsb started talking about GME. And more GME. I became wary. ""Reverse wsb"" they said. I was still bullish when it was trading around and 20 bucks a share, but thought I'd play it safe. I sold a put and got exerciced. Sold it back to market to break even. Gme posts started flooding my reddit feed. Dd this, dd that. 
I never read the DD.
Pages and pages of posts, enough to fill a textbook. I didn't even want to hear what all the autists were saying. If I would've just read ONE of them posts about the short interest I would've been convinced to buy and hold. I'd be rich right now.

I do not own any stonks of any kind; I didn't get in early because I'm not a stocker (you guys call yourselves stockers right? Or something like that?), didn't get in late because my financial state most of my adult life has been ""driven deep into the red by anything from minor car problems to excessively chunky peanut butter"". (Don't worry, I'm safe by virtue of having a dad in IT who foolishly believes I deserve to survive off my two kitchen jobs like some pinko commie).

If I could have made it in, I would have pulled out just enough for some minor financial security, maybe a few thousand or 10k's (I used to make $1600 a month working 80 hour weeks and I've still never had multiple thousands at once, so I assume that's the ""normal people range""); and then I would not have tried to game the squeeze at all. I would ride into the crash just to spite the broken system and the fucked up people fucking it up.

My situation is only indirectly due to 2008 and previous fuck ups; I never lost my job because of the crashes or anything. It's been a combination of coming of age exactly during the post-housing world (I was literally graduating at the time), a very long and constant stream of bad luck and mental health issues (sadly not stupidity or I would've ended up here), and just being stuck on low rungs for everything because I started on the low rungs and only people on higher rungs can climb rungs. Rungs doesn't sound like a word anymore. Ruuuuuungs. Wrungs.

I realize that there are worst-case scenarios where the entire market implodes, and as one of the little guys I'm probably going to be hurt by that. I realize that if you guys win, you'll be the new suits. Hell I know that some of you are already wearing nice pants. But fuck it. Fuck the people who treat human lives like a game, AND cheat at that game, AND are bad at it and just don't fucking care and don't have to. People need to learn there are consequences.

I'm anxious and scared of the possibility of the entire market disintegrating and the world becoming a post-apocalyptic hellscape instead of the current during-apocalypse hellscape. I'm defeated by the likelihood that I will wake up one day and things will have returned to normal and nothing will change. I'm dissociating because this is such a huge historical event and I'm just watching it in fucking real time while I play Animal Crossing. I'm annoyed because I'm just listing my emotions and the reasons I feel them and that seems lazy and boring and you guys probably don't even understand what letters are.

We know the talking heads on CNBC and other sites have been saying they can end the squeeze by offering shares to the shorts.  Momentum would stop and company could pay down debt, become investment grade, invest in business transformation.

But what about a direct listing to the public (no companies or institutions), maybe 5MM shares with a maximum ~10 shares per individual at some lower price.  They could build additional support for the company and its future, wouldn't dilute the stock significantly, and would not help the shorts get an easy bailout.  They can get much needed capital and keep our movement going.

Throughout all of this, I've felt compelled to remember two key facts: 


1) We are the good guys in this situation 

2) We are not the littlest fish in the room

&nbsp;

Point 1 is obvious to basically the whole world right now — our diamond hands have been forged under the pressure of cold, ruthless, faceless billionaires trying hard to squash us. No arguments from almost anyone on this point.

&nbsp;

Point 2, though, is easy to overlook. This whole thing is about taking back from the greedy ultra-rich and redistributing the wealth to the common folk. Still, this leaves out a part of the picture. Just about everyone who has a brokerage account with a few grand they're willing to lose is, on the grand scale, relatively fortunate. There are billions of people worldwide who couldn't imagine ever risking five grand, and many of them couldn't imagine making that much in the first place. Tons of our fellow citizens are starving, wondering how to make ends meet — especially right now, in the middle of a pandemic with crazy unemployment. I know I'm lucky to be secure enough to focus my energy on this for hours a day.

&nbsp;

I've been here since around 2014 and I love this community. Now we have an opportunity to do some good, and to simultaneously show the world that our money is, literally, where our mouth is: that we truly **believe** in the principle of not being excessively greedy, and allowing those in less fortunate positions to share in the wealth. This is why I'm committing to donating at least 5% of my profits to St Jude Children's Hospital, and another 5% to Water.org, after I sell GME for $42069 a share. Who's in?

How Clearing Demands Helped Ground the WallStreetBets Stocks

Telis Demos

&#x200B;

Last Updated January 29, 2021, 6:33 PM

When some online brokers including Robinhood Markets Inc. and Webull Financial LLC moved this week to restrict trading in GameStop Corp., AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and other stocks, fueled by Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, they did so in part because of obligations with clearinghouses that help ensure trading across the market isn't disrupted by defaults. Here's how it works.

&#x200B;

What is a clearinghouse?

&#x200B;

Consider the basics of trading: Buyers and sellers must agree on a price. The buyer then must pay the seller, and ownership must be formally transferred.

&#x200B;

Enter clearinghouses. The clearinghouse collects and distributes payments and transfers ownership. So traders are free to focus just on price, and to take the best price in the market regardless of who is offering it. Neither side has to worry about the other's ability to pay.

&#x200B;

For stocks in the U.S., the main clearinghouse is National Securities Clearing Corp., which is part of a larger clearing organization that operates in other markets, called Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.

&#x200B;

How do they work?

&#x200B;

Clearinghouses serve to mutualize risk. Members keep cash or collateral such as Treasury securities at the clearinghouse to cover their own activities and the obligations of other members should they fail. The clearinghouse might ask the members to post more of this money, often known as margin, if they are making riskier trades. The aim is to ensure that no individual member's failure causes the whole system to collapse.

&#x200B;

How does the financial crisis figure in this?

&#x200B;

In response to the 2008 collapse of broker-dealer Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., lawmakers writing the Dodd-Frank Act sought to beef up supervision of clearinghouses and to push more trading into clearinghouses. The focus was primarily on so-called over-the-counter derivatives, like credit-default swaps, that didn't have a central marketplace. The reforms also affected some longstanding clearinghouses, including National Securities Clearing Corp., by designating them as systemically important financial market utilities, which subjected them to greater regulatory scrutiny.

&#x200B;

Why would a clearinghouse have to increase requirements?

&#x200B;

As noted earlier, margin requirements often rise with risk. A sharp rise in the price of any security raises the prospect that it will decline just as fast, potentially adding to the risk of those trading and holding as collateral these securities.

&#x200B;

A challenge in the stock market is that settlement is not instant. The system allows two days after the day a trade happens until the shares and money must change hands, known as ""T+2"" settlement. Over those two days, the risk that a party might be unable to complete a trade can, in rare circumstances, change dramatically based on market conditions.

&#x200B;

One such circumstance might be when the price of a security is extraordinarily volatile. In that case, the seller is exposed to increased risk that in the event of a failure of a buyer to pay up, the security they would be stuck still owning is worth dramatically less. The extraordinary volatility of a stock like GameStop would increase such a concern.

&#x200B;

Another is the risk that a party suddenly owes an outsize amount of cash. In a normal market, any clearing member likely has a mostly balanced book of buys and sells, meaning they are both paying and receiving cash. And often many of their own customers' trades cancel each other, meaning they have no net obligation to the clearinghouse. But when a firm has a huge imbalance of buy orders, its obligation to pay cash skyrockets. This may have been the case this week, when there was much demand for just one or two stocks.

&#x200B;

So who decides it's time to increase margin requirements?

&#x200B;

How a clearinghouse judges these risks, and therefore when it makes demands for more upfront funds, is typically formulaic. Margins can be based on equations such as value-at-risk. Exactly how the formula works, and who is responsible for losses in what order, are important elements. In the case of National Securities Clearing Corp., losses would be covered by the defaulting member's funds before the clearinghouse's own funds or other members' funds would be used.

&#x200B;

A broker like Robinhood would also have to make decisions about its own capital, and how much it was willing or able to tie up in settlement. A broker may face separate obligations for capital levels, like with the SEC. Other brokers also clear via another intermediary -- like Apex Clearing, through which WeBull clears -- that is a member. These intermediaries may have their own risk controls they apply to their clients.

Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

🚀🚀Fidelity and Vanguard🚀🚀. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.

**TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. They will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.**

>The chaos we saw this last week was due to a squeeze experienced by the hedges that were holding a lot of naked GME shorts that did not have cash or stock on hand to cover their position when the stock blew up. A lot of other funds may still be in deep in covered shorts (they hold actual stock in addition to what they borrowed and short sold) which is pretty safe and neutral. Some may have small naked short positions and they may be seeking small share buys to cover or close them, or simply cashing them out for a loss isn't a major hit. Many of these short positions don't have a fixed timeline and are stable so long as the short continues to pay interest. Today GME was pretty quiet and I think the fluctuations were due to half of WSB selling and the other half buying.

I think the major squeeze is squoze. Certainly most of the major bleeding by the hedge funds over GME is done, as any of them with any sort of exposure and brain cells are covering if they weren't already. Some hedge fund managers actually know how to hedge.

Upshot is...this isn't going to go down like the VW short squeeze in 2008. Back then only a few players controlled the vast majority of the stock. In the GME situation the stock and shorts are dispersed over far more organizations and individuals.

If you have information or data to the contrary, I'd love to see it.

&#x200B;

Some of you may have read (or seen because you cannot read) my post yesterday about a Gamma squeeze today. ([1/29/21 - The Great Battle For Valhalla](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7b6t7/12921_the_battle_for_valhalla_gammainfinity/)) While I believe a Gamma squeeze in fact occurred, it was curtailed and did not catalyze the MOASS (Mother of All Short Squeezes) because brokerages like ROBINHOOD intentionally limited our ability to buy shares/apply pressure to the shorts 🩳AKA 👿Melvin Capital AKA 👿Citadel LLC.

&#x200B;

To be clear:

&#x200B;

[Melvin Capital 👿](https://preview.redd.it/f3wgl6mswde61.jpg?width=326&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9aa66ee90c72d260693450cd2be6d5bcb022960b)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Us 👨‍🚀👨‍🚀👨‍🚀 --\> What is your profession? DIAMOND HANDING LIKE A WSB RETARD! 🤚🏻💎](https://preview.redd.it/s0kflystwde61.jpg?width=385&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6863f1f9cba33c8264afd44e912a78ed3e59d06)

&#x200B;

**BUT WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN LIEUTENANT** u/Brassmonkeynutzz?

&#x200B;

Ok. Let's start with the basics for all of you who are wet behind the ears. What is a Gamma squeeze you ask? A Gamma squeeze occurs when option sellers/market makers buy shares of the underlying stock to hedge their positions/prepare for the possibility that call option buyers decide to exercise their right to buy. This type of hedge is necessary when a significant amount of call option strikes are expiring in the money (last week all available strikes expired in the money on a stock for the first time in financial history and this week a shit load of strikes expired in the money as well).

&#x200B;

Wait, you aren't actually reading this are you? If you are, I appreciate you. For those of you who cannot read (all of you), please see the TL;CR at the bottom of this post. (Hint: 🚀)

&#x200B;

Anyways, you might be wondering, why would Robinhood risk its reputation and entire business by limiting its customers ability to buy? Simple: ""Robinhood’s regulatory filings show the company charges large investment firms called “market makers” (👿CITADEL/MELVIN) fees to access real-time information about which stocks its users are buying and selling, a practice some regulators and industry watchers have seen as a potential conflict of interest."" In fact, ""Robinhood routes more than half of its customer orders to Citadel, by far its largest market-making partner by volume, Robinhood disclosures show."" ([source](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/robinhood-and-citadels-relationship-comes-into-focus-as-washington-vows-to-examine-stock-market-moves/ar-BB1ddG06))

&#x200B;

In other words, Robinhood is more concerned about saving the GAY BEARS 🌈🐻 that they are in bed with (their real customers - 👿CITADEL/MELVIN) than servicing retail investors like us. Ironically, Robinhood is taking from the poor and giving to the rich—it is ass backwards.

&#x200B;

Before I go any further, I have to once again congratulate all of the true autists who have diamond handed 🙌🏻💎thus far. Thank you for holding. You are truly retarded and I salute you. And of course, I salute our King, u/DeepFuckingValue🤴, with the utmost respect. We fought valiantly in ""The Great Battle for Valhalla"" today. And it is very promising that EVEN DESPITE Robinhood limiting our retarded power, we went from closing at 196 yesterday to 328 at close today, and 312 as I write this post. But clearly, this infinity war is far from over.

&#x200B;

If you sold like a paper handed pussy 📄🤚🏻🙀, then you are not a true WSB autist soldier. You are not one of us. Go invest in an ETF and leave this sub forever!

&#x200B;

**But I am a true autist, what can I do?**

&#x200B;

First things first, GTFO of Robinhood immediately if you do not have options expiring within the next week and transfer your portfolio to literally any other brokerage.  **(EDIT: Transferring will lock up your shares/portfolio until the transfer is complete, which could take a week or so; so only transfer now if you are ok with that—I am just so disgusted with RH at this point that I almost don't care and will be diamond handing my shares for more than a week most likely anyways).**  They are fucking criminals and they are trying to delay/mitigate the MOASS. I am personally transferring to **(EDIT) FIDELITY** unless you tards have a better suggestion.

&#x200B;

For those of you who were clenching when we got down to around 126 yesterday and around 250 today. I know you were scared. But the following cannot be overstated: **THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT! FEAR!!!!!**

&#x200B;

**JUST FUCKING HOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!** THEY WANT YOUR FUCKING SHARES SO BAD BECAUSE THERE IS A HUGE SHORTAGE.

&#x200B;

**HOLD THE MOTHERFUCKING LINE AND WE RIDE TO VALHALLA!**

&#x200B;

[HODOR 🙌🏻💎](https://preview.redd.it/95wf66vlxde61.jpg?width=275&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27b19f0511ed659d3bfbce8c033e0f5b9fe4a988)

&#x200B;

Shortage? YES A FUCKING SHORTAGE. Over 100% shares are still shorted. Do not listen to anyone who says Melvin Capital has closed out their short position. That is total bullshit.

&#x200B;

But, but, but, WhY iS CNBC AdVeRtIsInG tHaT MeLvIn ClOsEd iTs sHoRt pOsItiOn tHeN 🤪? ([Great post talking about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8539h/cnbc_now_running_ads_promoting_that_melvin/)) I mean seriously, ask yourselves, why the fuck would CNBC run paid advertisements about the shorts closing their positions? BECAUSE THE BIG BOYS WANT YOU TO THINK THE SQUEEZE IS OVER SO YOU SELL AND GIVE UP. FEAR NOT; THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZEN!

&#x200B;

**Think about it:** if Melvin closed its short position, it would simply move on to the next trade and never look back. There would not be any reason to ***pay*** to advertise that.

&#x200B;

**Summary:** the big dogs want you to think the squeeze is over, and they want you to panic and sell your shares. DO...NOT...DO...IT! Instead, **HOLD! BUY THE DIP! REPEAT!**

&#x200B;

**Monday, we ride at dawn!**

Then he tried $20,000. Then he tried $10,000.

Nothing. Robinhood just kept saying “We can’t process your request because you will make us go fucking bankrupt if the sell order is that far out”

Then he tried $8,000. Boom. It worked.

So I told him to try putting a high limit on another stock.

He could put any limit he wanted on any other stock without issue.

What does this mean?

This means that $50,000 is NOT a meme.

**AS LONG AS YOU KEEP CONTROL OF THE SHARES. YOU CONTROL THE SHARE PRICE. BASIC SUPPLY/DEMAND**

There are literally not enough shares available for Melvins side of the bet to work out. The math just simply doesn’t check out for him. This whole situation wouldn’t have happened if he didn’t make a horrible bet. 

If we all have $69,420 sell orders (imo, this is a very conservative and fair entry point for GME investors) then when Melvin starts closing their massive positions, the market will be absolutely flooded with buy orders. Eventually, those buy orders will find our $69,420 wall and eat it right up. The supply of shares to fulfill his side of the bet literally doesn’t exist. There aren’t enough shares—so theoretically, the price can go infinitely. In two months, you can invent a number and then request that number for your shares—Melvins gotta pay it.

All you gotta do is have those shares when he’s looking for them. We’ve got this. Everyone has our backs. The *only* way for them to get out of this is if we sell, or if they break the law with the whole world watching.

You’ve got this. It’s over for them. They know it. Robinhood knows it. Citadel knows it. It’s over.

The only day this week that the indexes closed higher than they opened was the day where Robinhoes restricted trading, because on the other days short sellers had to meet their growing margin requirements by selling other stocks. This, coming just after Tesla's earnings miss and the fact that it's a major component of the S&P 500 AND is considered to be a huge bubble by institutions, will literally drive Tesla stock into the dirt. Unfairly, mind you, because my price target for them is still $1600. Frankly, that target is conservative.

We’re you a part of the elite conglomerate of traders they talk about? The Autists of Wallstreetbets?!”

Your wife and her boyfriend walk out into the deck as well, you slap both their asses as they walk by per custom. “Oh Keith Elon we’ve talked about this! No bothering your father while he’s on the deck!” says your wife as she sits down next to her boyfriend on the limited edition AMC theater authentic seats. “Oh it’s alright babe, he’s about the age now where he should know, alright son listen up,” Keith Elon sits forward in his seat, eyes sparkling with interest. “There’s just one thing you always need to remember before I tell you this story son.” Your look changes, sharpens as your tone become serious. Keith’s face grows more serious as well, while maintain the curious look in his eyes. “Remember we have Diamond Fucking Hands in this family” with that your wife and her boyfriend roll their eyes, this being the one millionth time they’ve heard it.

it was a crazy week for most of us due to GME and other volatile stocks. Companies standing behind trading apps like Robinhood have imposed restrictions on trading GME stocks. Where to trade if not on Robinhood? 

Look for trading accounts via banks like brokerage checking accounts. Banks charge fees but you are going to be sure you won't get fucked by them just like by Robinhood or Trading 212 fintechs.

If you're using trading apps to invest in stocks at least read terms of services so you would know what to expect if shit hits the fan. Some brokers have their headquarters in financial havens like Cayman Islands. Did you know that? That is why I chose banks.

There is a lot of pros for using banks to invest:

* When you make an order through bank you have certainity that your order will be executed instantly on the market
* Banks don't sell data about your trades to hedge funds
* There is no conflict of interest beetwen you as an investor and your bank becouse it charges fee, so the more you make the more bank makes - win - win situation (they have no interest to fuck you, they want you to make more and more money)
* Banks can provide a lot of analytic tools and real, fast support in case of some issues

I hope you are going to rethink using frauded brokers like Robinhood or Trading 212, they don't play fair, they fuck us so why shouldn't we fuck them by denying to use them and destroying their reputation?

I wish y'all calm weekend and huge profits next week! 🚀"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185714.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['GME', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'GME']

HOWEVER, we might have won the battle today but this WAR ain't over!

**Gamestop last day of the quarter is this Saturday.** If they report a blow out quarter then that's more ammunitions for this. **A blow out quarter is basically GAMEOVER for the shorts.** We will have back ups from the whales everywhere swarming in.

Go to your local Gamestop store today and tomorrow and buy everything in the store with your GME tendies!

Most of you are now newly minted millionaires! So get out there and buy the shit out of your local Gamestop. If there is no Gamestop in your area, **shop online** (omnichannel) on their website. Don't play games? No problem, buy gift for your wife's boyfriends kids. DONATE to local charity!

TLDR; Shop at Gamestop using GME tendies so they can report blow out quarter which in turn will give you even more GME tendies. Its like you reinvested your dividend! This been bought up before but need to bring back up cause last day of quarter is this Saturday!

edit2: So it actually 4th quarter coming up. Yes I'm retarded. It's will be in their next  report coming up in March. March might be a long timer away but remember while some have covered, some are entering with new position at the 300s and some even entering at the high. So this will turn into a WAR of attrition, whoever the fuck gives up first win. I been in this shit for 2.5 weeks now. So get in the fucking trenches and bunker down! We going to hit higher high and higher low.

&#x200B;

Congrats on holding the line above $320 today. 

&#x200B;

As sad as it is, some of us would like to exit our GME position at some point in our lives. To strategize for this, I decided to do some quick math.

&#x200B;

As most of you degenerates know, VW temporarily became the most valuable company in the world in the great squeeze of '08. Well, why can the same not happen to GME? Surely, some will argue about the difference in the underlying financials between the two stocks. But to that, I ask, was VW ever shorted by 140%? Fuck no.

Let's do some quick math.

&#x200B;

Apple is the worlds most valuable company, at $2.215T.

GME has 69.75M shares outstanding

For GME to become the world's most valuable company, each share should be worth at least:

$2.215T / 69.75M = **$31,756 per share**

&#x200B;

Given the historical precedent of major squeezes becoming the world's most valuable company, I will be setting my limit value at **no less than $30,000 per share.**

&#x200B;

$1000 is not a meme. $5000 is not a meme. $10,000 is not a meme. and even $30,000 is not a meme.

&#x200B;

All views are my own and again, I am retarded so do not follow my advice, I am simply explaining my own personal strategy."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185646.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['GME', 'I', 'VW', 'GME', 'I', 'VW', 'T', 'GME', 'M', 'GME', 'T', 'M', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

1) Most of you are retarded enough to actually think that WSB are the only ones ""holding the line"" or ""driving the ATH"". You better wake the fuck up and smell the coffee that despite some big money being extremely short, other big money is using this ""retail investor"" front to benefit in the same way you are. As much as I understand the notion and as beautiful as it is, the reality is that rich guys are also getting richer with GME.

2) The more berserk the squeeze becomes, the heavier the losses for the shorts, the more liquidation will happen to cover. A lethal chain reaction.

1. Why someone can short 140% of a stock 

2. Why a broker can delist a stock whenever they want.

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it’s highest."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185646.csv|StockTicker|['AMC']|['AMC']|['AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'EVERY', 'MUST', 'ESOME', 'ANTLY', 'GME', 'AMC', 'HOLD', 'AT', 'LEAST']|['AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'GME', 'AMC']

This is the time that we have to fight back in this misinformation campaign as much as possible. We already very clearly see it on reddit with the bots, and I see very blatant false information being spread around like wildfire on tiktok. This is the perfect time to begin a campaign to get as many people informed about the situation as possible.

We have people of all colors, sexualities, genders, and political affiliations here, and we need to take advantage of this unity. People of all political parties need to use this time to create ways to distribute this information to others. We need to focus on doing things like:

* creating infographics for instagram that can easily explain the situation and why we are doing what we are doing. With more visibility on instagram and an easy way to digest it, it is more likely to cause people to become more interested on something that is very intimidating for most people.
* Clear out misinformation thats going on twitter, tiktok, etc. Many people and bots are acting in bad faith and using this as an oppurtunity to spread lies, and we need to SHUT THEM DOWN.
* Weed out the fake investments that only serve to divide us. We need to invest in a core group, and stick with it.
* ***MAKE SURE NEW INVESTORS (+OLD) HAVE A BACKUP NON-ROBINHOOD ACCOUNT***
* Clear out doubts to minimize the panic buying.
* Urge activists of all kinds to put heavy pressure on the government and Robinhood.
* Expand our reach. All eyes are on us, lets make sure it stays that way.
* ***ONE OF OUR MAIN COURSES OF ACTION IS TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENTS HAND INTO INTERVENING WITH ROBINHOOD, WE NEED THE ABILITY TO HAVE PEOPLE MAKE PARTIAL SHARES AND ADD AS MANY STOCKS AS THEY CAN.***

Use whatever tools you have available to spread the word. Leftist political activist pages: post infographics that explain the situation and how Robinhood's actions are unethical and illegal. Meme pages: continue to rally as much attention and hype towards this. Knowledgable investors, compile data and try to explain the technics of how stocks and investing work and try to make it easily digestable, such as explaining terms like short squeeze, etc, for the general public. If all branches of us unite, the stock WILL skyrocket. BUT we need a plan for the next two days. This is why I think we should have a thread like this where we can properly make a plan of action and discuss our method. I will make any edits needed!

DISCLAIMER: I am not a financial advisor, I just think the stocks are a pretty combination of letters.

Granted it’s not the most reliable source, but I thought it was interesting enough to mention. 

This part specifically got me curious because I know a lot of people on here have crazy limits set on their GME positions. And I am wondering if that is a good idea. 

> Setting a high limit order gives the clearing firm or third party that your broker may or may be under contract with the ability to see where your position will possibly be sold and gives them the opportunity to continually sell and buy back, some times hundreds of times in a matter of minutes, your position. With high frequency trading this often happens from algorithms or a “black box”.

1. This is a theory, and I'm not a financial advisor, but I'm not a rapper
2. My thinking is that if 💎✋buys 1/2 a share, the broker has to buy 1 share and credits 1/2 a share to the 💎✋ 
3. And the broker will keep the other 1/2 a share assuming that another 💎✋ or (🧻✋) will come along shortly to buy that other 1/2 a share
4. And when you increase the pool to a few thousand 💎✋, you use some statistical modeling to determine how many full shares to keep on hand to account for a know turn over of fractional shares
5. And then you use that pool of shares as collateral for the cash value you have to pay the 🧻✋when they sell
6. **Here's where it gets tricky** if the volume of purchasing and selling becomes *significantly* higher than normal, then the broker does not know how many shares to have on hand and might not be able to compute all of the transactions in a quick enough fashion to ensure that they don't mess it up bigly
7. So they have to **buy full shares for each fractional share purchased** until they can balance the books and sell off the appropriate number of shares to stay neutral 
8. This makes the dollar value of fractional shares in this fight carry a huge weight, a weight that the brokerage (and the 🩳's) can't 🐻
9. And through the power of alchemy turns fractional shares to 🚀 fuel

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. I literally can't find any sources online on the mechanics of fractional shares, but I think my speculation *might* be reasonable, but I'm not a rapper
2. If you know how this works please reach out so we can share this knowledge

TLDR; fractional shares are 💎✋ best friend, and 🩳 worst enemy

I got out at $60 but my risk tolerance isn’t super high so I’m fine with it and enjoying watching all of the gains from the sidelines.

I’m not trying to rain on the parade but I’ve been thinking a lot about VW, AMC, and GME and their short squeezes. Until this week, and specifically today, I’ve basically been of the mind set that GME is a real squeeze and the others (AMC, etc.) are not. But today I’ve changed my opinion. Please hear me out because I think there is a lot of logic to this.

THE SQUEEZE SQUOZE, NOW IT’S SIMPLE SUPPLY DEMAND
Ryan Cohen and GME ruling out bankruptcy are what caused the squeeze. Plain and simple. They created a better outlook and higher genuine value for the company. This gave us a little squeeze forcing shorts to move from their ~140% to ~120% short interest today.

Now that that squeeze occurred and they had to deal with raised price targets, we are simply dealing with very low supply. Shorters are not buying to cover really and lots of retards are buying creating upward movement a momentum. Not much supply. So right now there is no squeeze going on and we are all very dependent on stock lenders margin calling the shorts.


THIS ISN’T VW
Just wanted to add a short section here since this event does seem to be the inspiration we all draw from. In this case the shorts did get fucked and got margin called. The lenders did this because there was genuine concern that they would not get there stock back since there is 13x more shorted than there was available. If you buy that 1% and give it back to a lender you have 12% more to go, then you have to buy that 1% from that lender you just got it from, but what if they won’t sell? There was genuine concern from lenders they would never get their shares back. Total loss.


THESE SHORTS WONT BE MARGIN CALLED ANY TIME SOON
As it currently stands the shorts are paying 30% APR on tens of billions of dollars to the lenders with VERY LITTLE risk in the long term that they will not be able to get the shares back as EVERYBODY (even is, mind you) expects the shares to go back down a lot after this is said and done.

So from a lender’s perspective, would you rather call your shares back and end the party with huge yearly returns? Or would you rather drag this on for as long as possible and collect fees from shorts? The shorts will happily do it because they don’t want to lose their shirt, they would rather pay the premium. And even if they did call their shares back, the market would explode and crash before they even had them settled.

Really in the end, we are giving Melvin and the other shorts more time to adjust their position to a more favorable one before it comes back down. So in the end, unlike your believe that bears are fuk, it is retail investors that may be fuk.


CAN GME SQUEEZE HARDER?
I would say probably not soon. It could go higher if people keep buying and holding, but again, in the end retail might end up paying.

The one opportunity I do see would be a share vote or something else that could cause shares to be recalled. But that is unlikely and might not even happen at the yearly investor meeting.


HOW TO MAKE MONEY ON THIS
Honestly without lucky timing retail investors may be fucked here. Premiums on puts make it practically impossible to profit.

WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER SQUEEZES?
Similarly to the current state of GME, we are driving price up and giving shorts better entry and lenders fat APR.

TL;DR: this may be the best trick Wall-street ever played on us. Play acting that they are losing money and Robinhood is their martyr.

Edit: Thanks for commenting everybody. After this interaction I think the squeeze could work out, but it would take insane diamond hands and/or some strong buy pressure. Time and high borrow rates need to ware them down to be sure that this squeeze happens."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185716.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'VW', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'I', 'THE', 'UEEZE', 'QUOZE', 'NOW', 'S', 'IMPLE', 'UPPLY', 'EMAND', 'GME', 'THIS', 'T', 'VW', 'THESE', 'HORTS', 'WONT', 'BE', 'ARGIN', 'ALLED', 'ANY', 'TIME', 'SOON', 'APR', 'VERY', 'ITTLE', 'YBODY', 'CAN', 'GME', 'UEEZE', 'ARDER', 'I', 'I', 'HOW', 'TO', 'MAKE', 'MONEY', 'ON', 'THIS', 'WHAT', 'ABOUT', 'THE', 'OTHER', 'EEZES', 'GME', 'APR', 'I']|['GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

There is only one reason possible for this, they are completely out of money in every way. This is the only weekend activity that they can stop that costs them money. I think they are just praying that when all of the books are settled, they have enough money to cover.

What could these weekend instant deposits amount to? 1M? 2M? This is after the[1B cash infusion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-raises-1-billion-to-meet-surging-cash-demands-11611928504) and [emergency bank loans](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-said-draw-credit-lines-214509076.html). Thursday. And limiting trading on [50 stocks Friday.](https://www.kron4.com/news/robinhood-limits-trading-to-50-major-stocks-what-you-need-to-know/)

To put this news into perspective, when you are almost out of money you pay a large bill late or delay a big purchase. Then you stop eating out, buying extra things, cancel netflix, etc. This is the equivalent of going back through the trash to find the aluminum foil to turn in for pennies at the scrap yard that you walked to cause you can't afford the gas.

**Edit:** I do want to tell people that I don't think that RH is going under. I think they are standing on the precipise. But I think they will get any amount of emergency lending they need to stay solvent. (Too big to fail?)

**You are SIPC insured, to 250K for stonks on RH. You won't lose your money.** Don't sell and move you stocks, don't worry about it. Maybe open a backup broker, maybe move a little cash between the two over the next few weeks. Don't confuse anything I said for investment advice.

Don't use this as financial advice. It's prob. all bs and will get you bankrupt.

Ok, for all my GME autists, things have been rough this week but we've managed to pull through. With that said, I believe this was not just luck or sheer force of will, I think there are hidden actors on our side or, to the very least, profiting from our chaos. Why? Here we go:

1- Retail has been severely handicapped through platforms this week and, even with very few of us still active, we managed to keep the price of GME above 320.

2- During short attacks, especially the last one this Friday, someone went full blown Rambo and managed to fend off the shorters. If you look at the volume Friday in the last 5 minutes, we went 2x in volume to 600k.

3- Retail is running low on funds: most of us retards burned out our money pushing this shit up early in the week and have very few funds left, making impossible to pull these sorts of transaction.

Given the above, I believe some hedge funds have entered the game to try to f**k with their competitors, make money and frame retail as the guilty party of this (potentially taking down RH in the process).

If this is true, and I don't know if it is, next week we need to be extra careful to see what happens after the gamma squeeze finishes. For me, that will mean to keep track of volume because, as soon as these undercover big boys are out, I believe that it is the right time FOR ME to get out.

Either way, what people think? Do we have some MMs helping pour gasoline in the fire?"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185712.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['I', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'RH', 'I', 'I', 'FOR', 'ME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Now is your time!! These rich mofos are in debt... TO YOU. And guess what - they refuse to pay their debts!!! In fact, they're doubling down.

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when it’s time to close the positions of shorted shares and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short position will have to close in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  And, who can forget our grandson GME? 

AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when shorts have to close their positions and as a result of that they themselves take the price higher.

More by u/Common-Buy-2379 in comment section:

AMC is also 49.85% owned by a Chinese holding company. This company controls over 75% of voting shares indirectly, through controlling interest in subsidiaries that also own shares.

They will NOT be bailing out the hedge funds, which would dilute their ownership in the company. They will not be floating their shares for sale during the squeeze.

In all likelihood, the upcoming stock issuance will be sold to larger firms with little interest in assisting the hedges, and will probably remain within Chinese control.

Not financial advice, I just read the 10-k, 8-k, and 10-q, because I like this stock. Also tendies. I love tendies.

To illustrate, If the Chinese owned shares aren't available to fill the shorts, then there's only 13M shares to fill the 44M shorts.

It's WAY shorter than people think.

Positions: 

- 1700 AMC shares balls deep @ 18$ average (~30K)
- 6c AMC 19/3 (10 contracts)

Edit: Earlier I had “shorts expire” in this post which seemingly drew some people crazy ignoring other important aspects. I meant to say when shorts will have to cover their positions. Edited in post.

Edit: Rockets added. 🚀🚀🚀 Also adding some 💎💎💎 for your hands."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185646.csv|StockTicker|['AMC']|['AMC']|['AMC', 'AMC', 'EVERY', 'MUST', 'ESOME', 'ANTLY', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'HOLD', 'AT', 'LEAST', 'AMC', 'NOT', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'M', 'M', 'WAY', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'I', 'I']|['AMC', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC']

Many of us on Wednesday had options purchased weeks or months before, some just a few days earlier that were beautifully profitable --- which by Thursday morning were well on their way to being worthless because of these criminals.

No one denies that FD's and 3DTEs are risky, but it was never on the menu that these guys would change the rules to steal from us like that.

For those of you with those weekly calls over 15 strike. RIP, will never forget this bullshit maneuver. Our fallen comrades, we shall redeem tendies in your name.

Learn from this and we will grow stronger. Let this pain help you form 💎✋💎✋💎✋ because no one with 🧻✋ is allowed on the 🚀🚀🚀🌛

Feel free to share your expired weekly positions and how much they were worth on Wednesday close.

Note that BB is NOT a short squeeze, just a popular stock here because the company is on the cusp of going full throttle on its phenomenal decade long turnaround from hardware to software. Trading volume has been huge on green days because we like the stock, but the price rises for a small/mid cap have been at most 30 to 40% and usually far less.

DONT LET THEM SCARE YOU AWAY JUST FOR IT TO SKYROCKET RIGHT AFTER YOU SELL!

It’s quite obvious hedge funds and shorts are trying to manipulate the market to drive AMC down. Despite their full efforts, AMC and all the memes skyrocketed 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 to the moon 🌙🌙🌙🌙 today even with robinhood restrictions. 

This shows that we are already stronger than them. The more they try to manipulate, the more I buy and the more I hold.

We have to show them they can’t fuck around with us like this. We have to show them that we are going to the 🌙 via AMC sponsored rocket ship 🚀 whether they like it or not.

We will not be weakened by manipulation. We will be strengthened by it and the shorts will be terrified and cry about their rising debts and impending bankruptcies. The retail investors will win this time. The funds will be surprised but we will win. 

So buy. Robinhood tried to scare me. But I switched to schwab and I bought even more, in fact I transferred more money in and bought the dip. Though, This isn’t about the money anymore. It’s about the revolution. It’s about showing the funds who’s boss. That they can’t manipulate us into paperhand selling. We will not be manipulated anymore. Retail together can easily destroy funds. Remember this heading into Monday and we will all see unlimited tendies next week. It’s about free markets we want to make it clear to the funds and big boy media groups that they can’t just manipulate the market and strike fear into the market with media advertisements to make us sell. They should know once we have decided it’s going up and that we like the stock, it’s going to moon.

I am a senior film student at well known university in Connecticut (Ivy League, rhymes with whale). For my senior film thesis I have been documenting the rise of this subreddit. I started back in August when this sub was going all in on Tesla FD's but now things have taken a crazy turn.

Clearly something massive is happening right now and it needs to be properly documented. Years from now some hollywood pansy is going to make this a movie and completely fuck up the real story.

Don't y'all want one of your own telling it? (My positions are 100 shares GME @ 37.50 and 200 shares NOK @ 4.06)

Ok, before I retire to my weekend, I have to let you know why I do believe this battle can be won by us only one way and why there is right now more likelihood short sellers can win. 

You know that the Short interest ratio has not changed much and it is still above 100%. And you also know probably borrowing rate for short sellers is >30% per annum, meaning you short 100$, if you keep it for 1 year, you will pay the lender >30$ in interest.

Ok, we have to remember this! Not the same short-sellers might stay in this game forever. Some get in, they get hurt, they get out, someone else takes the rein, meaning not one single hedge fund will pay >30% rate per annum on fees.  They believe this will blow over very soon 1-2 months max, they will pay 5-6% on that shorted stocks but if GME goes down, they will probably make 50-60 maybe 90%. If GME goes up to 600$ they will short at that price, if it rises to 800$ they will short at that, overall, one day they believe (and that day they believe is not 1 year but few months ahead, they will make a ton of money). Therefore, you see SHort interest has not changed much, some have covered, but others have stepped in, believing that the current price is too high, they can make money at this level. 

 They believe this is a beautiful asymmetric risk and reward trade based on historical short squeezes. take the example of VW. Google it. 

TAKEAWAY and ONLY WAY TO SQUEEZE:  ONLY WAY WE CAN REALLY SQUEEZE THEM OUT IS TO HOLD THIS STOCK FOR MONTHS TO COME, NOT 1 or 2 months but maybe 1 YEAR! The only way to bleed them out is to make sure they are shorted for the long term, they pay borrowing rates, they lose money as the stock goes up, they get out, and also, REMEMBER, every quarter they have to send letters to their CLIENTS explaining how their portfolio did. WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS for FEW QUARTERS so that when their investors see their performance, they will either pull the money out or force them to cover! THIS IS LONG TERM GAME guys. YOU have to hold it even if it passes 1000$! THEY BELIEVE this will be over SOON, they will make a ton of money on their shorts and they will be able to show great returns to their clients. WE HAVE TO HOLD IT! LONG TERM! THIS IS THE ONLY WAY! 

If you don't hold it at least for 1- 2 quarters, the game will be won by the last short sellers.

WE REALLY LIKE THIS STOCK!!!

EDIT: This is my hypothesis that as the stock rises, the appetite to short will grow. One of the reasons is because A lot of you keep saying we will sell at 1000$. WHY are you giving them that precious tip?! They know where most of you will exit. As this approaches to 1000$(diamond fingers crossed), they will keep shorting more.  Remember, this is not TESLA. SHORT interest in Tesla declined when TESLA became hundreds of billions in market cap. GME is still 23bln$ there is more way to go. As the market cap grows, shorters' power declines, and they lose interest. Just like in Tesla.

Citron said in his video that a squeeze can’t happen if insiders keep selling, but insiders (likely) CAN NOT sell company issued stock because of end of fiscal quarter lockup/blackout period, which usually extends until earnings are reported (which is on 3/26!!)

TLDR - no insider selling means more 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 fuel because paper handed insiders can’t give in to the shorts even if they wanted to.

Alright listen up. I did a quick search on WSB and didn’t see any hits actually talking about what is known as a “quiet period” or “blackout” for corporate stock trades in relation to insiders selling their company issues GME stock.

You NEED to know this to understand one of the big points that Citron made is complete BS in the short term (insiders creating liquidity for shorts).

I’m assuming that many WSBers have never received stock based compensation and may not know the general corporate governance rules around them that many (most/all?) companies impose on their insiders. Here’s a quick education in that and a summary of what it (might) mean for GME.

Obligatory disclaimer: I’m not a financial advisor and I am long GME.

First: what is stock based compensation?

This is exactly what it sounds like, when as part of your comp for being a good employee, you get some sort of stock with some sort of conditions attached. There are many different flavors of this that are important.

options - these give you the right to buy stock at some fixed price, known as a strike price, which may be significantly below than market value (good!). There are many different types of option (eg ISO, NQ), but at the end of the day most are a discount coupon for cheap below market stock values. These are common for preIPO companies. You’ll see these in the world of SPACs, for example, as warrants.

RSU: restricted stock units - these are literally shares, given almost like cash. More common for post IPO companies.

PRSU: performance RSUs - usually tied to some job performance goal, such as hitting a certain amount of revenue or other measurable goal.

Almost all stock based compensation comes with conditions, such as complying with whatever is in the associated company stock/equity plan. These are usually things like time vesting, which simply means that you can’t take stock and run but rather have to let it vest over a period of months/years.

From the wallst perspective, stock comp is reported as an expense, so you’ll see it in financial disclosures and investor presentations from time to time.

Second: how do companies ensure these incentives don’t hurt them or other shareholders?

This is critically important. Besides making sure there are clear policies on vesting and such, companies need to make sure that insiders do not use their company granted stock to hurt themselves or other shareholders, by performing trades during times when the employees may have critical information that the public does not. 

This is usually wrapped up in an insider trading policy.

Now, when WSB usually thinks about insider trading, you may think some hot head exec tipping off their golf buddy that the stock is about to crash (or pop) and they should act accordingly. Yes, that’s insider trading; however, there is a more mundane version which is insiders who might have a general idea if earnings are going to be good or bad and making trades of their own company stock to profit themselves.

To protect against that, companies will often place quiet periods / trading blackouts BEFORE THE END OF A QUARTER, often by weeks at a time, AND EXTEND THAT BLACKOUT THROUGH EARNINGS REPORT DAY.

READ: end of GME quarter is THIS MONTH, meaning it is incredibly likely that all GME issued stock owned by insiders is locked up under the corporate blackout.

This is almost certainly why you don’t see RC or anyone else from GME saying anything right now, due to quiet period.

In practical terms, GME would likely partner with a trading platform to administer stock grants, such as E*TRADE (which is common). The stock admin at GME would communicate blackout dates to E*TRADE (in this example), and During these dates, all of the sell functions in that stock plan account would be disabled.

READ: GME insiders see their stock plan values going through the roof right now, and CAN NOT SELL because of corporate blackout. This means the shorts can’t cover with insider liquidity like Citron said.

Since these blackouts usually extend thru earnings, and that is weeks/month away, those shares would be unavailable to bail out the shorts for paper handed insiders.

SUMMARY
Citron said short squeeze can’t happen when insiders are selling .... Insiders (very likely) can’t sell because of end of quarter blackout. 

This should be common knowledge for Citron and other shorts. Anyone else on here who has dealt with stock based comp, please do sanity check me here and I’m happy to edit and refine.

Edit: This is 🚀🚀🚀🚀 fuel , since this means yet more of the outstanding shares that are inaccessible to cover shorts."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185652.csv|StockTicker|['GME', 'THRU']|['GME']|['CAN', 'NOT', 'TLDR', 'I', 'WSB', 'GME', 'NEED', 'BS', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'ISO', 'IPO', 'IPO', 'WSB', 'EFORE', 'THE', 'END', 'OF', 'A', 'ARTER', 'AND', 'XTEND', 'THAT', 'CKOUT', 'ROUGH', 'NINGS', 'EPORT', 'DAY', 'GME', 'THIS', 'MONTH', 'GME', 'RC', 'GME', 'GME', 'TRADE', 'GME', 'TRADE', 'GME', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'SELL', 'MMARY']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Here's my narrative of what took place this week:

**Melvin Short Squeeze / Bailout**

To understand the genesis of the bailout by Point 72/Citadel, it's important to understand how L/S hedge funds operate.  The customers that these businesses are competing for are their investors (LPs), which consist of pension funds, insurance companies, and family offices, etc.  These LPs have their own portfolio managers who examine their investments periodically and might decide that they should invest in a L/S HF for diversification purposes or some such reason.  The entire L/S strategy competes amongst itself for these LP dollars.  All things being equal, LPs will invest in the funds that have the best historical returns.  This leads to a competitive landscape where L/S funds only need to do better relative to each other, rather than the overall market.

When you game theory this out, it leads to these funds largely mirroring each others plays, while doing things differently only to the extent they think they have an information advantage over their competitors.  This results in certain stocks having large numbers of Funds as their investors, both as longs and shorts.  The term for these companies on Wall Street is ""Hedge Fund Hotels"".  

As Reddit squeezed Gamestop, it increased the amount of money owed on Melvins short, which led them to sell longs in order to de-risk and cover.  Because they sold these long positions, it had a contagion effect on HFs in the same space, who held the same longs and therefore had losses as Melvin's selling pressure began to crush their funds.  Because of this contagion effect, Steven Cohen and Citadel stepped in to bailout Melvin not because he thought it was a good investment, but to prevent an entire hedge fund strategy from imploding.  

Now, it's very important to consider how this $2.7B dollars was likely used by Melvin.  For Melvin to fight Reddit by shorting GME would have been the institutional equivalent of a WSB YOLO, and likely would not have worked.  For them to use the $2.7B to buy stock and cover would have been very difficult, as they would be directionally moving the same way as both Retail and Option Dealers who were trying to delta hedge, which would have spiked the price of the stock much further.

Logically, I think Melvin used the money early this week to buy massive amounts of call options at a range of expiries and strikes.  This would allow them to de-risk their toxic position economically while not continuing to spike the price of the shares as much as buying in the open.  This explains why the short interest of the stock didn't move much for most of this week - the shares were still sold short, but the squeeze wasn't as harmful to Melvin, as their MTM gains on the options could be used as collateral on the short position.  As they exercise options going forward, they can cover their short.

This also explains CNBC's deception when they said Melvin had ""closed the position"".  Notice they don't say ""covered their short"", as that's not true.  It also explains Steven A. Cohen's taunt of a Tweet this week, where he said ""bring it on.""  It was almost as if to say, ""We've bought our options, we're done here.  Do what you want, you fucking Plebes.""  

Understand that if what I'm saying turns out to be the case, Melvin got very special treatment from their Prime Brokers.  A broker would never let you use risky option positions as full collateral against a short to avoid a margin call.  Understand also that if this is true, the bad news is that the squeeze will never be squoze the way Reddit thinks, but the good news is that the stock will enjoy good price support for a while as Melvin exercises their options and sucks up shares to cover the actual short.

TL,DR: The squeeze won't quite be squoze."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185714.csv|StockTicker|['A', 'GME']|['GME']|['S', 'S', 'HF', 'S', 'LP', 'S', 'B', 'GME', 'WSB', 'YOLO', 'B', 'I', 'MTM', 'A', 'A', 'TL']|['GME']

Edit: to clarify, the whole point of my stating ""when the short ladder started"" is not that a short ladder occurred, but that it WAS ALLOWED TO OCCUR BY RESTRICTING YOUR ABILITY TO PURCHASE THE STOCK. The whole subject of this discussion is that ""they are going to change the rules so that you cannot win"", and I am proven correct with each passing day. Mathematically there should be almost no limit to what this price will go to, but here you are, stuck at sub $400.

They lied on social media about closing their short positions and we made memes about it.

Next, they'll try to wait us out. The price went sideways today. We all expected the gamma squeeze to start and it never materialized. And that is by design, because now it's a psychological game. Now they want us to see the squeeze fail to materialize, day after day as they extend their positions, in the hopes that we get bored and give up. They are trying everything they can to make sure that this doesn't look the same as the VW squeeze, so that we decide that we miscalculated, or that this isn't happening.

Fuck that.

Even if it doesn't squeeze higher from here, you can collect 30+% annualized interest. You are a credit card company now, and the shorts will have to shell out at least $6 Billion a year to borrow those shares that they can't cover. Everyone just buy a single share, make sure it is not on margin, and the entire float could be tied up indefinitely. It is time to become the bank and collect the loan shark level interest rates from them.

Another reason we like the stock, is because it is a steady and stable revenue stream. This is a sound investment IMO. It's like we are buying bonds that actually pay well.

There are other short sellers. And these stocks, not just GME , but others too, became extremely volatile and on giant volume.

So first there is the issue of liquidated funds that do not have immediate cash.

They hold positions and would have to unwind them to get cash to cover their margin calls.

Melvin Capital I read was down 30% and got bailed out, so they still have assets, just not liquid, no immediately available cash.

Trust me, if they had a gun to their head they'd have immediately available cash, they'd manage.

Second, even after what happened in 2007-2009, financial institutions with systemic risk are not THAT capitalized.

It's not new and never gets solved: in 1987 NYSE specialists had to bed big banks to provide them with more cash or the whole world would collapse.

And I think bureaucrats do not understand how this all works very well. No one does honestly. But bureaucrats are really clueless and under or overreact. Always.

It gets scary for the clearing firms when you have GME making $35 billion volume and going up 400% in 2 days, AMC making $20 billion and gap 300%, higher volumes than Apple and Amazon that are already higher than usual and on 100 times the volatility .

Interactive Broker CEO was the most honest in my eyes and in an interview with CNBC said they halted trading to protect their clients, the clearing houses, the market, and themselves. He said if they had not done it the short squeeze would have kept ""going and going"", so regulators & brokers agreed to stop it all to ""stop the losses"".

Robinhood decided to re-open trading and the CEO pretended he halted trading of the very volatile stocks as routine like ""oh didn't notice anything special was going on"" 🤡.

Webull CEO said in an interview their clearing house told them they could not take trades anymore. I think they use another entity than Robinhood does.

Not sure why Robinhood halted buying (and not selling). There's really the need for an investigation here. I can't tell you what happened because we do not know.

&#x200B;

My 2 cents:

Short sellers are still very strong on this stock, I think they might even have added, I don't know if they are friends with the clearing house but either way they (ch) get stuck in this game, and retail investors are understandably angry at getting blocked like this.

Brokers don't have billions to my knowledge with which they can cover counterparty risk and they have no contractual obligation to do so and I mean they're not santa claus.

My personal opinion is short sellers refusing to liquidate and take the L is the source of all risks and problems (most of it might be options that they can just hold? Not sure how this gets counted in short interest).

Maybe already the counterparty clearing firms got wiped clean, but regardless of this if the price skyrockets further and the bagholding shorts that refuse to close while they can end up being liquidated and margin called, it's truly over for the market. Everyone is going bankrupt, WSB crashed the world.

The counterparty providers risk is real, but I am not their accountant, I do not know how bad things are, and we don't know what actors (if any) are of good faith. It could be (it probably is) shorties refusing to take the L, putting the whole market at risk.

I think they are really worried the price gets to 5000. From the Peterffy ( IBKR ) interview they really expected this. And it might still happen.

Lehman Brothers, James Cordier, Melvin, same story. They get greedy, they refuse to get out, they get rekt.

And sometimes they get an unfair bailout, and are so deluded they actually think they got unlucky when they really messed up.

TLDR: We didn't just screw over some poorly leveraged hedge funds. We put the whole system to the test and almost broke the plumbing."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185710.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['GME', 'GME', 'I', 'THAT', 'NYSE', 'I', 'GME', 'AMC', 'CEO', 'CNBC', 'CEO', 'CEO', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'L', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'L', 'I', 'IBKR']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'IBKR']

The story so far:

So if the GME squeeze actually follows through and we all hold it theoretically could hit like 10k or more per share. The problem with that is it would probably tanking the whole market stupid hard and send the stock market into a recession potentially. Because, virtually those shares could not be paid back. It’s why Robin Hood was in a panic they didn’t have enough liquidity. The squeeze is being suppressed for the reason it can’t be paid out. Essentially, unless other funds bail out the ones that went broke and go broke with them and then have the government or banks bail those guys out that would be the only way. But I’m doing so all of that would devastate the stock market because all of those hedge funds and bankers will have to liquidate every asset they have. Realistically, it would be like the ‘08 crash but in our favor or anyone holding GME or any other meme stock that flies with it. Because, investment institutions will get drained and all that should go to the people. Hopefully.

The plan:

Now for those who might see this. The idea should be to buy long term put options on either big Tech, or actually virtually anything because of an incoming massive decline. This would destroy the market tho because you couldn’t have those paid back either, due to if the situation above happens. But wait before you say “what’s the point?”. After the stocks of all these companies go to shit unfortunately because of the GME squeeze and put options they should be sent to such a low value that those who do have money can swoop in and absolutely take control of stocks that the rich and manipulative did. We then become the majority shareholders we become the stock market. The rich don’t control the companies the people control the companies we control what we like and what we want. The retail investors become the stock market.

Tldr; 

The GME squeeze could destroy the market. Buy gay bear puts to make it worse. Then buy back all the stocks of big companies and have the retail investors take over the market. 

I am a bit drunk and I am missing a lot of extra points but think about how stupid this could be

Turns-out he owns 95% of the Mets. It was really important to him, [he went from owning 8% in 2013 to finally taking over controlling majority in November of 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cohen_(businessman)#New_York_Mets). So that means he's gotten to be majority owner of the Mets for about 90 days. Isn't that nice?

The Mets are worth [$2.4 Billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/194627/mlb-franchise-value-of-the-new-york-mets-since-2006/) (<--there's probably a better way to look this up but this has the basics) making Cohen's piece $2.2. In order to take majority ownership, one would need to purchase 48% of the Mets from Cohen and/or the 5% holder (family that owns the team). 48% of 2.4 =

1.15 billion.

In theory, that would be a fair price (according to my smooth brain math).

So I think we should offer him $500 million *cash* for 48% of the Mets, with the option to buy more if the family turns-over their ownership to Cohen.

$650m less than the smooth-brain value of his stake in the team, but it would be an injection of $500m liquid capital which could help him buy GME shares from us right away.

I don't know how to run a fucking baseball team, doubt any of you do either (wait, maybe dfv...). But we could flip the majority stake to, idk, Jay-Z? Turn a little profit, make a foundation for families that got burned during the 2008 housing crisis and front-line medical workers?

Thoughts?

 The options market is what was even more messed up than the GME stock. All options released were becoming ITM. I had never seen this. The options clearing corporation were releasing absurd call strike prices and they were striking. All of them. Let that sink in. 

The Options Clearing Corporation guarantees all of the options made. Go give the investopedia on them a read. They are conveniently doing maintenance tomorrow on their website and data will be down. The Options Clearing Corporation Serves as a central clearinghouse and regulator for listed options traded in the United States under the auspices of the SEC. The SEC was supposed to have oversight of them. 

Lies were told across all major news networks. Interviews were given and headlines tried to push a narrative. 

They painted r/wallstreetbets in a bad light. We are individual people making our own decisions. Taking our own risk. They took our financial freedom away from us on Thursday January 28th 2021. They limited access to buy stocks and drove the options price down to almost exactly max pain on low volume while they locked us out of a ""free""market. 

Today they must have had a plan, limit shares, short ladders,  hovered around most of the day and close at 320. Those same news stations all point to Robinhood a company that was soon to IPO at close to 20 Billion dollars. A company that was on a future course to make more in payment orders for stock and options than any other broker. 

Another thing I have never seen is that bid/ask. The market makers were allowed to set it way wider than normal. That is not the issue. Someone needs to investigate why the bid was lowered so much lower almost all day than the ask. I am talking major movement to the bid. 

Also someone needs to look into Jeff Psaki as he was leading the credit component of the strategy at Citadel. Why was this 140% short allowed from one of their brokers?

I heard they treat their customers like shit and care more about boot licking some billionaires dress shoes than providing a quality service to their users.

They also use some pretty sketchy methods to profit off their customers so once that becomes more widely known I don't feel like their user growth will continue any longer.

Also they have an extremely unreliable and low quality service compared to their competitors of which there are hundreds, that provide the same general services with better quality and respect to their customers.

Finally, the company is also facing a couple class actions due to their illegal and sketchy methods of abusing their users.


Personally I would stay away from their IPO if that ever happens now, cuz I don't think the risk of the business surviving in the long term is very high, their customer growth is abysmal, and the lawsuits will definitely put a drain on their capital. Also their CEO looks like he's still a virgin, so how can he run a successful business if he can't even successfully dip his banana?

I’ve made a ton of comments and posts about this with no real replies, so I don’t think there’s any recourse whatsoever if this happens.

Either RH shuts down completely “pending investigation”, or they conveniently experience an outage while the squeeze is happening. Either way, those of us with GME shares in RH can’t sell when the squeeze happens.

Can’t transfer the stocks to another broker since that takes a week, and by then the squeeze will likely be done and the price will come crashing down again.

And a lot of us don’t have the spare cash laying around to just buy more shares at another broker and forget about the ones we have in RH.

It’s a serious concern, and I think there’s a near 100% possibility that they pull something like this as it’s their only move to stop people from making money on the squeeze. Those of us stuck with RH will be forced to watch our shares gain a ton of value, not be able to sell, then watch the price tank.

We need it by Monday.**  I'll fucking cashapp you $100 if its good enough to get pinned. (Other retards, feel free to chip in)


It should contain the following:

----

##1. A summary of the situation

Your audience is normal people, not retards. Keep it honest, unopinionated, professional:

Hedge funds overly shorted a stock, and we can make them pay. They put themselves in a vulnerable position, and we have the power to capitalize on it. The fundamentals of the stock are largely irrelevant, but Gamestop is not destined for bankruptcy -- in fact it's future looks bright.  (Lots of links.  gmedd, roaringkitty summary vids, anything you can find)

This section will contain links that are sympathetic to our efforts:

* Tweets by celebrities
* Videos of Chamanth and other immortals defending us
* Videos of that old boomer cooperman saying ""fair shake is bullshit. its just an attack on the rich!""
* Articles about what GME now represents

---

##2: What is short selling?

A description of why hedge funds are vulnerable. They borrowed shares, and must pay interest on what they owe. As the price of the stock goes up, they are incentivized to buy shares back (called ""covering"") so that they do not need to pay interest anymore. Every time they cover, the price will go up, creating a feedback loop. This is a short squeeze.

They borrowed so many shares that we can very easily make it difficult for them to buy shares back. ""Difficult"" means ""expensive"". The profits go to us.

---

##3: Current pain index

A section showing the hedges current pain.  These values will be filled in with current estimates, but the user can alter them as they see fit.

The idea here is to gamify this a little. Show really big a number from 1 to 100, where log($1m/day) = 1, and log($1b/day) = 100, and below it the $/day.

Explain that we collectively push this index higher by buying shares, and not ever selling.

This section also displays how this number is computed: how many shares are estimated to be borrowed and how much interest they are paying.

* Current short interest (in shares) estimates.
* Current borrow amount (short interest x share price)
* Current borrow fee
* Pain:  Daily / Weekly / Month cost to remain short
* Estimated available shares to buy (float minus locked shares.. can be linked to WSB post that estimates this or make your own)

---

##3: FAQS

Real, honest, and transparent with the risk.

**How does a short squeeze work?**  Link to a youtube video with an animation so that any ape could understand it.

**Count me in! How do I buy shares?** Fidelity of Vanguard. Other brokers have previously prevented the purchasing of GME shares. Do not trust the following: (big list of shitty brokers)

**I'm told this is a bubble/speculative/volatile/etc** This is true. This is not for everyone. If you cannot stomach the risk of losing what you put in, then you should sit this one out.

**Will I end up a ""bagholder?""** Unfortunately, it is possible you will not sell for more than you paid. The higher the price is, the more likely this becomes. It is extremely difficult to predict what price is the peak, or when the short squeeze is over and the prices will fall. For that reason, we once again recommend not putting in more than you can afford to lose.

**How high could the peak go?** The amount of GME shares shorted is unprecedented. Additionally, the amount of attention this situation has received is also unprecedented. Therefore, the peak could be unprecedented.  As the supply of shares gets lower (from us buying and holding), the demand gets higher (from the pain index increasing) -- thus the price goes higher. This cycle feeds back on itself until supply and demand balance out.

## TL:DR: yes its long. Grab a beer. 

&#x200B;

Until his dying day in 2014, Nelson Bunker Hunt, who had once been the world’s wealthiest man, denied that he and his brother plotted to corner the global silver market. 

Sure, back in 1980, Bunker, his younger brother Herbert, and other members of the Hunt clan owned roughly two-thirds of all the privately held silver on earth. But the historic stockpiling of bullion hadn’t been a ploy to manipulate the market, they and their sizable legal team would insist in the following years. Instead, it was a strategy to hedge against the voracious inflation of the 1970s—a monumental bet against the U.S. dollar.

Whatever the motive, it was a bet that went historically sour. The debt-fueled boom and bust of the global silver market not only decimated the Hunt fortune, but threatened to take down the U.S. financial system. 

The panic of “Silver Thursday” took place over 35 years ago, but it still raises questions about the nature of financial manipulation. While many view the Hunt brothers as members of a long succession of white collar crooks, from Charles Ponzi to Bernie Madoff, others see the endearingly eccentric Texans as the victims of overstepping regulators and vindictive insiders who couldn’t stand the thought of being played by a couple of southern yokels.

In either case, the story of the Hunt brothers just goes to show how difficult it can be to distinguish illegal market manipulation from the old fashioned wheeling and dealing that make our markets work.

**The Real-Life Ewings**

Whatever their foibles, the Hunts make for an interesting cast of characters. Evidently *CBS* thought so; the family is [rumored](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9446483/Dallas-the-feuding-family-that-inspired-the-TV-series.html) to be the basis for the Ewings, the fictional Texas oil dynasty of *Dallas* fame.

Sitting at the top of the family tree was H.L. Hunt, a man who [allegedly](http://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/30/business/the-hunts-a-dynasty-built-on-poker-and-oil.html?pagewanted=all) purchased his first oil field with poker winnings and made a fortune drilling in east Texas. H.L. was a well-known oddball to boot, and his sons inherited many of their father’s quirks.

For one, there was the stinginess. Despite being the richest man on earth in the 1960s, Bunker Hunt (who went by his middle name), along with his younger brothers Herbert (first name William) and Lamar, cultivated an image as unpretentious good old boys. They drove old Cadillacs, flew coach, and when they eventually went to trial in New York City in 1988, they took the subway. As one Texas editor was quoted in the [*New York Times*](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=19800328&id=2Z5RAAAAIBAJ&sjid=520DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5985,4950668&hl=en), Bunker Hunt was “the kind of guy who orders chicken-fried steak and Jello-O, spills some on his tie, and then goes out and buys all the silver in the world.”

Cheap suits aside, the Hunts were not without their ostentation. At the end of the 1970s, Bunker boasted a stable of over 500 horses and his little brother Lamar owned the Kansas City Chiefs. All six children of H.L.’s first marriage (the patriarch of the Hunt family had fifteen children by three women before he died in 1974) lived on estates befitting the scions of a Texas billionaire. These lifestyles were financed by trusts, but also risky investments in oil, real estate, and a host of commodities including sugar beets, soybeans, and, before long, silver. 

The Hunt brothers also inherited their father’s political inclinations. A zealous anti-Communist, Bunker Hunt bankrolled conservative causes and was a prominent member of the John Birch Society, a group whose founder once [speculated](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19610401&id=mxkQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8IoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2507,24704&hl=en) that Dwight Eisenhower was a “dedicated, conscious agent” of Soviet conspiracy. In November of 1963, Hunt sponsored a particularly ill-timed political campaign, which distributed pamphlets around Dallas condemning President Kennedy for alleged slights against the Constitution on the day that he was assassinated. JFK conspiracy theorists have been obsessed with Hunt ever since. 

In fact, it was the Hunt brand of politics that partially explains what led Bunker and Herbert to start buying silver in 1973.

**Hard Money**

The 1970s were not kind to the U.S. dollar.

Years of wartime spending and unresponsive monetary policy pushed inflation upward throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. Then, in October of 1973, war broke out in the Middle East and an oil embargo was declared against the United States. Inflation jumped above 10%. It would stay high throughout the decade, peaking in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution at an annual average of 13.5% in 1980.

Over the same period of time, the global monetary system underwent a historic transformation. Since the first Roosevelt administration, the U.S. dollar had been pegged to the value of gold at a predictable rate of $35 per ounce. But in 1971, President Nixon, responding to inflationary pressures, suspended that relationship. For the first time in modern history, the paper dollar did not represent some fixed amount of tangible, precious metal sitting in a vault somewhere.

For conservative commodity traders like the Hunts, who blamed government spending for inflation and held grave reservations about the viability of fiat currency, the perceived stability of precious metal offered a financial safe harbor. It was illegal to trade gold in the early 1970s, so the Hunts turned to the next best thing.

As an investment, there was a lot to like about silver. The Hunts were not alone in fleeing to bullion amid all the inflation and geopolitical turbulence, so the price was ticking up. Plus, light-sensitive silver halide is a key component of photographic film. With the growth of the consumer photography market, new production from mines struggled to keep up with demand.

And so, in 1973, Bunker and Herbert bought over 35 million ounces of silver, most of which they flew to Switzerland in specifically designed airplanes guarded by armed Texas ranch hands. According to one [source](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921964,00.html), the Hunt’s purchases were big enough to move the global market. 

But silver was not the Hunts' only speculative venture in the 1970s. Nor was it the only one that got them into trouble with regulators.

**Soy Before Silver**

In 1977, the price of soybeans was rising fast. Trade restrictions on Brazil and growing demand from China made the legume a hot commodity, and both Bunker and Herbert decided to enter the futures market in April of that year.

A future is an agreement to buy or sell some quantity of a commodity at an agreed upon price at a later date. If someone contracts to buy soybeans in the future (they are said to take the “long” position), they will benefit if the price of soybeans rise, since they have locked in the lower price ahead of time. Likewise, if someone contracts to sell (that’s called the “short” position), they benefit if the price falls, since they have locked in the old, higher price.

While futures contracts can be used by soybean farmers and soy milk producers to guard against price swings, most futures are traded by people who wouldn’t necessarily know tofu from cream cheese. As a *de facto* insurance contract against market volatility, futures can be used to hedge other investments or simply to gamble on prices going up (by going long) or down (by going short).

When the Hunts decided to go long in the soybean futures market, they went very, very long. Between Bunker, Herbert, and the accounts of five of their children, the Hunts collectively purchased the right to buy one-third of the entire autumn soybean harvest of the United States.

To some, it appeared as if the Hunts were attempting to corner the soybean market.

In its simplest version, a corner occurs when someone buys up all (or at least, most) of the available quantity of a commodity. This creates an artificial shortage, which drives up the price, and allows the market manipulator to sell some of his stockpile at a higher profit.

Futures markets introduce some additional complexity to the cornerer’s scheme. Recall that when a trader takes a short position on a contract, he or she is pledging to sell a certain amount of product to the holder of the long position. But if the holder of the long position just so happens to be sitting on all the readily available supply of the commodity under contract, the short seller faces an unenviable choice: go scrounge up some of the very scarce product in order to “make delivery” or just pay the cornerer a hefty premium and nullify the deal entirely.

In this case, the cornerer is actually counting on the shorts to do the latter, says Craig Pirrong, professor of finance at the University of Houston. If too many short sellers find that it actually costs less to deliver the product, the market manipulator will be stuck with warehouses full of inventory. Finance experts refer to selling the all the excess supply after building a corner as “burying the corpse.”

“That is when the price collapses,” explains Pirrong. “But if the number of deliveries isn’t too high, the loss from selling at the low price after the corner is smaller than the profit from selling contracts at the high price.”

Even so, when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission found that a single family from Texas had contracted to buy a sizable portion of the 1977 soybean crop, they did not accuse the Hunts of outright market manipulation. Instead, noting that the Hunts had exceeded the 3 million bushel aggregate limit on soybean holdings by about 20 million, the CFTC [noted](http://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/29/archives/new-jersey-pages-us-fights-effort-by-the-hunts-to-corner-the.html?_r=0) that the Hunt’s “excessive holdings threaten disruption of the market and could cause serious injury to the American public.” The CFTC ordered the Hunts to sell and to pay a penalty of $500,000.

Though the Hunts made tens of millions of dollars on paper while soybean prices skyrocketed, it’s unclear whether they were able to cash out before the regulatory intervention. In any case, the Hunts were none too pleased with the decision. 

“Apparently the CFTC is trying to repeal the law of supply and demand,” Bunker complained to the [press](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1977/04/29/hunts-ordered-to-defer-acceptance-of-soybeans/1db5c239-92e9-4859-8a6b-12d94cee68f3/).

**Silver Thursday**

Despite the run in with regulators, the Hunts were not dissuaded. Bunker and Herbert had eased up on silver after their initial big buy in 1973, but in the fall of 1979, they were back with a vengeance. By the end of the year, Bunker and Herbert owned 21 million ounces of physical silver each. They had even larger positions in the silver futures market: Bunker was long on 45 million ounces, while Herbert held contracts for 20 million. Their little brother Lamar also had a more “modest” position.

By the new year, with every dollar increase in the price of silver, the Hunts were making $100 million on paper. But unlike most investors, when their profitable futures contracts expired, they took delivery. As in 1973, they arranged to have the metal flown to Switzerland. Intentional or not, this helped create a shortage of the metal for industrial supply.

Naturally, the industrialists were unhappy. From a spot price of around $6 per ounce in early 1979, the price of silver shot up to $50.42 in January of 1980. In the same week, silver futures contracts were trading at $46.80. Film companies like Kodak saw costs go through the roof, while the British film producer, Ilford, was forced to lay off workers. Traditional bullion dealers, caught in a squeeze, cried foul to the commodity exchanges, and the New York jewelry house Tiffany & Co. took out a full page ad in the *New York Times* slamming the “unconscionable” Hunt brothers. They were right to single out the Hunts; in mid-January, they controlled 69% of all the silver futures contracts on the Commodity Exchange (COMEX) in New York.

But as the high prices persisted, new silver began to come out of the woodwork.   

“In the U.S., people rifled their dresser drawers and sofa cushions to find dimes and quarters with silver content and had them melted down,” says Pirrong, from the University of Houston. “Silver is a classic part of a bride’s trousseau in India, and when prices got high, women sold silver out of their trousseaus.”

According to a [*Washington Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/03/27/police-charge-southwest-man-with-burglaries-in-3-areas/edfb54d6-52e8-446a-8ce5-2cab5b7578bc/) article published that March, the D.C. police warned residents of a rash of home burglaries targeting silver. 

Unfortunately for the Hunts, all this new supply had a predictable effect. Rather than close out their contracts, short sellers suddenly found it was easier to get their hands on new supplies of silver and deliver.

“The main factor that has caused corners to fail \[throughout history\] is that the manipulator has underestimated how much will be delivered to him if he succeeds \[at\] raising the price to artificial levels,” says Pirrong. “Eventually, the Hunts ran out of money to pay for all the silver that was thrown at them.”

In financial terms, the brothers had a large corpse on their hands—and no way to bury it.

This proved to be an especially big problem, because it wasn’t just the Hunt fortune that was on the line. Of the $6.6 billion worth of silver the Hunts held at the top of the market, the brothers had “only” spent a little over $1 billion of their own money. The rest was borrowed from over 20 banks and brokerage houses.

At the same time, COMEX decided to crack down. On January 7, 1980, the exchange’s board of governors announced that it would cap the size of silver futures exposure to 3 million ounces. Those in excess of the cap (say, by the tens of millions) were given until the following month to bring themselves into compliance. But that was too long for the Chicago Board of Trade exchange, which suspended the issue of *any* new silver futures on January 21. Silver futures traders would only be allowed to square up old contracts.

Predictably, silver prices began to slide. As the various banks and other firms that had backed the Hunt bullion binge began to recognize the tenuousness of their financial position, they issued margin calls, asking the brothers to put up more money as collateral for their debts. The Hunts, unable to sell silver lest they trigger a panic, borrowed even more. By early March, futures contracts had fallen to the mid-$30 range.

Matters finally came to a head on March 25, when one of the Hunts’ largest backers, the Bache Group, asked for $100 million more in collateral. The brothers were out of cash, and Bache was unwilling to accept silver in its place, as it had been doing throughout the month. With the Hunts in default, Bache did the only thing it could to start recouping its losses: it start to unload silver.

On March 27, “Silver Thursday,” the silver futures market dropped by a third to $10.80. Just two months earlier, these contracts had been trading at four times that amount.

**The Aftermath**

After the oil bust of the early 1980s and a series of lawsuits polished off the remainder of the Hunt brothers’ once historic fortune, the two declared bankruptcy in 1988. Bunker, who had been worth an estimated $16 billion in the 1960s, emerged with under $10 million to his name. That’s not exactly chump change, but it wasn’t enough to maintain his 500-plus stable of horses,.

The Hunts almost dragged their lenders into bankruptcy too—and with them, a sizable chunk of the U.S. financial system. Over twenty financial institutions had extended over a billion dollars in credit to the Hunt brothers. The default and resulting collapse of silver prices blew holes in balance sheets across Wall Street. A privately orchestrated bailout loan from a number of banks allowed the brothers to start paying off their debts and keep their creditors afloat, but the markets and regulators were rattled.

In the words of then CFTC chief James Stone, the Hunts’ antics had threatened to punch a hole in the “financial fabric of the United States” like nothing had in decades. Writing about the entire episode a year later, [*Harper’s Magazine*](http://harpers.org/archive/1981/05/silver-thursday/) described Silver Thursday as “the first great panic since October 1929.”

The trouble was not over for the Hunts. In the following years, the brothers were dragged before Congressional hearings, got into a legal spat with their lenders, and were sued by a Peruvian mineral marketing company, which had suffered big losses in the crash. In 1988, a New York City jury found for the South American firm, levying a penalty of over $130 million against the Hunts and finding that they had deliberately conspired to corner the silver market.

Surprisingly, there is still some disagreement on that point.

Bunker Hunt attributed the whole affair to the political motives of COMEX insiders and regulators. Referring to himself [later](https://books.google.com/books?id=UiwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA185&lpg=PA185&dq=bunker+hunt+favorite+whipping+boy,&source=bl&ots=_35ozQB6E2&sig=VPGUSMSzx3rqvCISdwjLVqtB7-I&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiVjM31tKjOAhUNyWMKHWKdDScQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&q=bunker%20hunt%20favorite%20whipping%20boy%2C&f=false) as “a favorite whipping boy” of an eastern financial establishment riddled with liberals and socialists, Bunker and his brother, Herbert, are still perceived as martyrs by some on the far-right. 

“Political and financial insiders repeatedly changed the rules of the game,” wrote the [*New American*](http://www.thenewamerican.com/culture/biography/item/19360-nelson-bunker-hunt-r-i-p-the-myth-of-the-hunt-brothers-scheme-to-corner-the-silver-market). “There is little evidence to support the ‘corner the market’ narrative.”

Though the Hunt brothers clearly amassed a staggering amount of silver and silver derivatives at the end of the 1970s, it is impossible to prove definitively that market manipulation was in their hearts. Maybe, as the Hunts always claimed, they just *really* believed in the enduring value of silver.

Or maybe, as others have noted, the Hunt brothers had no idea what they were doing. Call it the stupidity defense.

“They’re terribly unsophisticated,” an anonymous associated was quoted as saying of the Hunts in a [*Chicago Tribune*](http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1980/05/18/page/113/article/the-brothers-hunt-they-buy-right-and-sell-wrong-like-ordinary-folk) article from 1989. “They make all the mistakes most other people make,” said another.

Now, alot of people have been brought together throughout all of this. This has been the start of something HUGE, legen.....dary and bigger than all of us.

After today, hitting our target prices for $GME and $AMC, I am curious about what the endgame is? I know this has got to end at somepoint somewhere and there will most likely be bagholders at the end of all this..a lot of people are going to be hurting, in a time where people are already really hurting. So what side will prevail? Will some retailers, people like you and me, be holding in the end? Or will these shorters have to take the L and just eat it all? 

For awhile everyone here were made out to be unknowledgable kids who are just gambling and don't understand the risks by the media, and will need to understand when it's time to pay up its time to pay up..In my opinion however, these hedges that shorted got caught with there pants down..they knew the risks and thought it could never happen. So much so they shorted over 100%. And now the tides against them, drowning them. Shouldn't they be the ones to take the L and pay up?

I think we need to consider the possibility that the NYSE might halt trading on GME to prevent further market irregularities. This could happen as early as next week, based off my extensive speculation.

But have no fear! Who would a 30 day halt on trading hurt? The guys who are hemorrhaging billions 🌈🐻

What if GME offered an obscene amount of shares knowing that they wouldn't all be bought and only bought as a worst case scenario for the hedge funds?

What if they did a cap raise of 50 million shares all at a price of lets say $1000?

If hedge funds are forced to cover, that's their out.  Or for fun, we could do it at 2000.  Or, a range of prices.  The first million shares at 1000, the next at 1100, etc.

All current holders, Ryan Cohen, board members, etc would get diluted.  But, they would be getting diluted and the value of their shares would increase due to the raise being higher than the current stock price.

EXAMPLE. 50m shares at 300 are available right now.  They share 50m more at 1000 each.

Each share gets diluted by half, but each of the current shares gain 500 dollars of value.

Essentially, by selling the shares at 1000 each, current share value goes up to $650.

I don't know what I'm talking about, if what I'm suggesting is stupid, say so.  Or, get this to the top of wsb as a worst case trigger to pull.

Lets call it 110% to be conservative and make math easier
[Teacher would kill me for using a tweet as reference](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219)

Shares outstanding 69.75 million. But we care about the float so 46.89M Lets call it 47 because math is hard
[Yahoo Data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/)

Current interest rate says 32.8%. Again 33 is close enough
[Rick Roll](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)


So for hedge funds that are short what would it take to cover? Pretty simple from the yahoo data 47M shares in the float * 1.1% short = 51.7M shares shorted * 313 our current stock price = 16.182B $ lets call it 16.2B to cover all the outstanding shorts


    $16,200,000,000 to cover all outstanding short positions based on current stock price


On the other side how much is this costing the shorts in total per day? 
For each share: 313 * .33 = 103.3 $ per year per share / 365 = .283 $ per day/share * 51.7M = 14,630,000 a day
Or since rounding might screw us and lazy (313 * 51,700,000 * .33) / 365 = 14,630,000. Hooray it doesn’t


    $14,630,000 being spent per day on interest payments


This seems to leave them with a choice. 
Wait it out because it will take 3 years to pay the same amount of interest that it would be to cover today while scalping shares along the way to slowly recover their position. In the meantime probably some intensive lobbying to see if they can change the rules to make being retarded illegal.

Or cover, which based on what we have seen seems to scare the shit out of them. 


Tl;dr What does all this mean? Fuck if I know, I would bet they are going to try their hardest to wait this out and let it blow over and play whatever dirty tricks possible to keep from being forced to cover and send us to the moon. Either way best way to get #2 to happen is to HOLD YOUR DAMN SHARES AND DONT LET THEM SLOWLY RECOVER. 

Im letting my shares ride, im either going to be a whaler on the moon or im back to 0.

Something about financial advice, but this is just math, do whatever the hell you want with your own damn money

Edit: Formatting sucks

Edit 2: This is for a snapshot in time right now, not indicative of what could happen in the future, just something to keep in mind. if (or when) the price goes up or volatility goes up, interest rates go with it. Check out the Iborrow link to see past interest rates hit as high as 82.9%

Since everyone is in a state of euphoria (or shitting themselves like Vlad), we would start to neglect otherwise important variables that are part of the big picture.

For example, are there any rules in place for these funds, not just the shorts but also the funds that are actually causing the price action of all these tickers yet allowing this sub to get blamed for the market movement, from riding the hype wave up and selling at intervals in order to finally do their job and hedge?

The sub has yet to create a megathread of the proof of conflicts of interest, corruption, suppression, and manipulation. Everything needs to be documented, so having everything in a megathread (also create copies in case of BS) will be helpful in the lawsuits and probes to come. From Citadel having former SEC members working for them to the short laddering techniques to the restriction of buying but not selling on Robinhood, ALL of this needs to gain exposure.

Antifraud Rule [Securities] Law and Legal Definition

Antifraud Rule is one of the most important rules promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that prohibits deceptive or manipulative practices like material misrepresentations or omissions in the buying or selling of securities. The rule codified at 17 CFR 240.10b-5 says:


§ 240.10b-5 Employment of manipulative and deceptive devices.


It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,


(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,

Just spreading your gospel. We all need to see this. 

BEWARE WEEKEND SCARE TACTICS

We made it through the battle today and are UP 69% (nice). The hedges are only getting more desperate after the put options that expired today but REMEMBER: they have at LEAST 2-6 days in the market to pay these off, and likely have MANY MORE options expiring in coming weeks. With the lack of shenanigans today I predict an extended-hours ladder attack is incoming when many retail traders are sidelined from the action, combined with another media push of scare tactics incoming this weekend. We were caught off guard with the RH bullshit but hopefully enough people can get set up with Fidelity next week to even the playing field. But above all else: fuckin hold and we're golden

DON'T TRUST EXTENDED HOURS PRICES TODAY OR MONDAY MORNING.

 DON'T TRUST ANY MEDIA HITPIECES CLAIMING THE SQUEEZE IS OVER THIS WEEKEND. 

THEY WILL TRY TO KILL THE HYPE WHEN TRADING IS DOWN AND CAUSE A MONDAY SELL-OFF. 

HOLD. THE. FUCKIN. LINE.

I have been thinking about Melvin's exit strategy here and what possible ideas they could have to get themselves out of the fucking mess they have got themselves in.   


Everyday I have been checking [short volume](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme) and if my brain isn't completely smooth I believe that means the number of NEW shares being sold short in a given day, not counting any that have been closed.   


Now when we had that jump from 20-30 the short volume was like 33% of the total volume which to me is just mind blowing that these people are STILL trying to short a stock with short interest already over 100%.  


I guess for  🐻 just like we want to see who can get the highest limit order filled they all want to short ATH and try cover their other losses for shorting at lower prices.   


**WHERE THE FUCK AM I GOING WITH ALL OF THIS?**

**Bear thesis:** Melvin is going to take advantage of Robinhood & co's fuckery to raise the stock price every day before open and short it down during the day. Because we don't have a large portion of people able to buy the volume has obviously been very low the last couple days compared to what it should have been. Eventually Melvin hopes public sentiment fades in the next week and people begin to fear a drop and everyone sells off and they go home licking their wounds but not broke.   


**Bull thesis:** Assuming Citadel/Melvin had a hand in the disgusting shit these brokers are doing they have only made things worse for themselves if people 💎🤲 . I am guessing a lot of people will be transferring their shares to other brokers that allows them to add to their position and thanks to Citadels retarded move ALL the shares that are being transferred lower the float even further. So as long as those of us who can still buy keep buying and dont fucking sell then Melvin has really fucked it. They could simply be delaying the inevitable and we have seen this stock go up as much as 100% in a day multiple times in the last couple weeks so once reinforcements come in then that might be the final dildo up their ass.  


All of this is speculation and I am retarded so please correct why I am probably wrong because scrolling through this sub all day isn't enough confirmation bias apparently.   


**TLDR: AM HERE FOR CONFIRMATION BIAS PLEASE SEND  🚀🚀🚀  IF TOO MANY WORDS AND DONT FORGET TO** 💎🤲

We must continue to fight and hold the line. We have been able to show Wall Street that any retail investor, no matter the amount of tendies they may have - cannot be ignored anymore if we stand ***united***.

***Second: this is my Personal Opinion, and I am not a financial advisor in any aspect (just a fellow autist) but this is what I believe Wall Street will do to try and divide us, and this is my thought process on how they will do it:***

This small little problem of theirs has grown to a point where the entire world of retail traders has banded together to create an army. They are scared shitless of what the market could develop into and what may happen next. We are flipping their financial models and theories upside down, throwing their predatory algorithms into dislocation, and most of all driven a giant spotlight into their practices and now they are in a very uncomfortable position and will do anything in their power to go back to the way things were.

**Distraction**: They don’t want gamestop or their manipulative practices to be the center of attention anymore so they need to put a bigger story out in front of people’s faces. I believe they will band together and dump the equity markets in the coming weeks, and at such a fast rate that it becomes the new focus of attention.

***Why would they do this***? Well if the problem can’t be fixed - then fuck it all - break it. Use the destabilization of the current markets to try and force weak hands for whoever is holding GME to sell, and at the same time profit from everyone else’s losses on every other stock.

**This sets up a beautiful scenario/narrative for them:**

1. To make it look like a well thought out short thesis instead of what it actually is *(a manipulative coordinated attack against us)*, they will use WSB and gamestop as an excuse to try and draw attention to the fact that the market is overpriced and has been for sometime to justify the price drop. They’ll incite fear and all the other tactics we’ve seen over and over again ***(we see you CNBC).***
2. They will use this to accelerate the market tanking and severely drawdown our purchasing power by decreasing the prices of all of our other holdings so our margin requirements become tighter and try to shake us out of our GME positions.
3. If they are successful *(and they will try everything to make sure we are not)* when the dust settles, they will then blame us for what happened to the markets. They will say how inexperienced we are and then the media will double down their efforts and show stories of retail investors who lost their life’s savings and had no idea what they were doing etc. ***(which btw, fuck them because they don’t get that even if we lose money in the market this group teaches more incredible things about market dynamics and is a better use of tuition money than half the universities teaching bullshit financial concepts for 50k a year).***
4. Finally, they will use all of this to put the regulators back in their court and create new policy to box us out even further while saying it’s only to protect us.

**tldr;** *United we stand, divided we fall* ***-*** I could be completely wrong but either way - **hold that mother fucking line team.**

***Take a look***\*: With these record volume numbers in options and stocks, its easier to bury some of the data so it doesn’t seem completely abnormal. I chose the QQQ as a reference for the picture below because it’s more volatile but all the major indices have similar data and you can look for yourself. Below is a photo of the 20 largest options transactions that took place today to close out the week with the amount and expiration dates.\*

Pls correct me if im tardly wrong.

Thanks so much for this let me add my retard maths:
If it cost $14.63 mil in daily interest to sustain shorts at $313 a share

Then the $2.75 billion by Citadel can cover interest (assuming it covers for all shorts) for 187.96 days - rounded 187 days.

Of course since bitch Melvin gets 2.75bil  his total coverage assume as 15% of total short so his interest is 15% of $14.63 mil = $2.19 mil

So with $2.75 bil, Melvin can ride out interest in 1,255 days assuming stock stays $313.

However no investor wants his money to bleed 🩸 like that time of month, so i assume 1/3 will be used for Melvin to hold at $313 so that is 418 days

We do not know capital infusion other shorts have. So worst case assume they can hold for around 2/3 of a year at $313 (2/3 cost not every short has baby daddy citadel to balls deep $2.75bil)

What next? Buy to raise price and hold to maintain pressure on shorts interest and lock their capital. That will likely make them give up and cover, resulting in price ⬆️.

But if large amount is sold, opposite will happen, due to large short interest the stock price will fall and fall and meet the shorts expectations.

Summary this is a stranglehold between long and righteous holders like us and short mofos. Only one will get out alive.

&#x200B;

Alright, I hate to say it, but there is some less-than-ideal information circulating out there, particularly about the famed ""gamma squeeze"" we hear so much about these days. I'll get to that. Let's go through the questions you simpletons want to know, as explained by a mouth-breathing fool who has managed to convince you he knows what he's talking about:

# Did we win today? Is it endgame?

Kind of. Be patient.

# In what ways did we win?

First, there was the obvious victory of bouncing back 65% today after the worst market manipulation I've ever witnessed. We kept the upward momentum going.

Secondly, every day you finish higher is another day the shorts are underwater. If you are perpetually going up, the walls are closing in on them.

Finally, a lot of put options expired worthless today while a number of call options expired in-the-money. It's always good to make put holders lose money because you drain the bank accounts of people betting against you.

# Yes! Call options! We finished above $320 and get a gamma squeeze to infinity now, right?

No. That's not how this works. Too many people don't quite understand what a gamma squeeze is.

A gamma squeeze happens when call option sellers (or ""writers"") have to hedge their naked calls by buying stocks. They do this because the risk of selling naked calls is theoretically infinite if they don't. It's called delta hedging. You don't need to know all the fancy math (""delta"" and ""gamma"" are those greek symbols for nerds), just understand this: as it becomes more probable that the call option you sold will cost you money, you hedge more.

This is a continuous PROCESS, not a discreet moment in time. The market makers and hedge funds and institutions selling you calls don't wake up on Friday morning and think, ""Shit! I think I'm going to lose everything if these stocks keep going up! I have to BUY NOW!!!"" That would be stupid. They are hedging all the way up. I guarantee you that most of the calls that were exercised at $320 today were already covered. They already went out and bought those shares and most of the upwards pressure that places on the market is priced in already.

# So, no gamma squeeze?

Probably not significantly. They're not going to be madly rushing out on Monday to buy shit they already own for the most part.

# Why are people talking about a gamma squeeze at $320, then?

We did have a gamma squeeze at $320. On Wednesday, two days ago. The price exceeded $320 (then the highest strike price on the books) and promptly surged to $371 before coming back down to around $320. That's what a gamma squeeze is: a frenzied rush by call sellers to cover calls.

It typically happens BEFORE expiration, not after. It's rare for market makers to get so caught with their pants down that they have to get squeezed for the previous week's calls on a Monday. I don't know where this idea of a gamma squeeze now at $320 is coming from.

# This hurts my feelings. So, what's so great about the $320 threshold, anyway? Did it matter at all?

It's still a good thing. There may have been a few lingering naked calls to cover. And, like I said, it's always good to make put-holders lose money because stick it to the 🌈🐻, that's why.

$320 was a significant level because there were quite a few open call options at that strike. You can see the entire option chain here: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain)

Go through and count up all the January 29th options that were in-the-money at today's close. I think maybe 90,000 or something? Screw it, I didn't count. Somebody who can figure out how to use a calculator can add those up. Multiply that number by 100 (because option contracts are sold in groups of 100) and that's how many shares need to change hands thanks to contracts expiring ITM.

It may be that with so many shares needing to change hands and so little liquidity in this market, some weird things could happen.

# What weird things?

Well, if nothing else, a lot of shares will need to be tied up as the process of settling calls plays out.

You have to remember that when somebody says they own shares, they don't necessarily *own* own the shares right at that moment.

When you press ""buy"" on your phone and it says your order was filled, that doesn't mean that the process happens instantaneously. For all intents and purposes as far as you are concerned, sure, the process looks instant. However, there's a lot of messy stuff that happens on the back-end of the system between the brokers and the clearing houses. The clearing houses are where the daily tab gets settled: who owes whom and what they owe and at what price, etc.

Monday could be interesting as this tab for millions of stocks (in a market with only 50-something million shares actively circulating) gets settled. It might not be crazy, but it could. We'll see.

Michael Burry (Christian Bale, for all you noobs) seems to think that all the naked short-selling above the float will result in a shit-storm when people actually go to get their shares back: [https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1355221824661983233](https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1355221824661983233)

Liquidity crunch + lots of shares being moved around + nobody knows where they all are currently = potential nightmare for Wall Street.

# I just want my infinite short squeeze and my tendies, so how do we get the MOASS?

Something needs to be the catalyst. Something needs to get the short sellers really underwater, so much so that they are drowning. That's why there's been so much hype about gamma squeezes; the gamma and short squeezes are two separate things, but the gamma squeezing has been really good to us lately. It has triggered some crazy upwards price movements. I still think one was about to happen yesterday morning that would have triggered the squeeze-pocalypse, the Mother of All Short Squeezes. The bastards at the brokerages (acting with and for the clearing houses), took your tendies. It's criminal what played out.

I actually think a gamma squeeze was possible today, as well, as the price shot up to $378 around noon. If it had gotten to $400, it stood a very good chance of running up to $500, which would have caused a run up to $650 and beyond. Then Robinhood said, ""Oh, actually, you plebs cannot buy 5 shares anymore, only 2 now."" The price came back down again.

Oddly enough, the S&P500 sold off over a full percentage point (that's a lot of money) right after GME hit that $378 peak. Do you think this doesn't freak the finance world out? They know a gamma squeeze is like the fuse on a firework. It consumes itself until it ignites the rocket.

# How will Wall Street defend themselves?

They will try to keep snipping the fuse. That's what all these restrictions on brokerages are about. They are trying to defuse the situation slowly because having it all get sorted out quickly and frantically is no good for them.

We need enough upwards price momentum that those option chains keep going up and up and feeding on themselves. They need to become a self-sustaining chain reaction, fed by hedging pressure. And you need to put pressure on your elected representatives to tell them that Wall Street cannot be allowed to just shut down the game when they are losing. I hate to tell you this, but the squeeze has so far been stopped purely by the losers declaring that it will not happen at any cost. It's bullshit. Eat the rich. But there it is.

# Do you feel you've used the word ""squeeze"" too much by now?

Yes. I've been writing and looking at the word ""squeeze"" so much that it is starting to lose its meaning. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeeeeeze.

TL;DR Shares most likely already bought so no gamma squeeze, doesn't matter anyway  🙌💎🚀   🙌💎🚀   🙌💎🚀

We are mid-February, the squeeze squoze 🚀, we all cashed out at 5,000 tendies per share 💰Gamestop released 1 million shares in the process (a drop in the ocean) banking in $5B, they are debt free with $4.5B on hand 🤑Citadel and other motherfuckers are bankrupt praying not to go to prison, no bail out this time 🚓

After the sell off Gamestop dropped in the $50-100 range but unlike those boomers we see the value in $GME, we buy back for the long haul, the shares settle in the low $100s. Their best selling apparel is DFV's Roaring Kitty t-shirt.

We already made history but we didn't stop there, the mods are holding us accountable and we all give a percentage of our gain porn to charities. Gamestop does the same and gives $100M to the Barstool Fund to help those that the SEC, Wall Street crooks, dishonest journalist puppets, and other brain dead greedy fucks tried to illegally wipe out. We changed the lives of thousands families, friends, small business owners, and Gamestop won generations of life long brand loyalty.

It's 2023, we're cruising, lord Ryan Cohen is doing his magic, let's check back in 2 years.

It’s 2025, Gamestop successfully transitioned to digital by taking a significant portion of a now $300B gaming market. We’re smooth sailing at $2000 a share, looks like we just got ourselves another 100-bagger, life is good.

Aside from media and billionaires freaking out, which gives me confidence that this is real, let's take a look at some other examples.

At the beginning of this week, we were looking at volumes close to 150-200M. That volume obviously took a hit yesterday when many brokers decided to stop allowing purchases, but even today, the trading volume was relatively low. Additionally, the stock price has continued to increase all of these days indicating that there are more shares BOUGHT than sold. The price is around $315 and most people STILL aren't selling, indicated by the low volume today (Friday). That means this price will likely hold as a baseline since we keep taking more shares away from the float and are holding onto it.

This has become a movement though, and more and more people are willing to purchase a ticket to stick it to wall street. You think fewer people are going to get involved...hell no! More people want in on this, with those from Canada, Australia, UK, Germany, and across the world getting in on this. If people keep buying more shares and holding, there will be fewer shares available for trading and we'll likely see even less volume in the days ahead. How do we know they'll hold...well most of those getting in now are doing so to stick it to wall street so they don't mind losing some money if it comes to it. Most importantly, this means THEY WILL HOLD! Plus, a smaller accessible float means the price will rise or at least stay stable, neither of which is sustainable for hedge funds. This does NOT end well for them in any way.

The squeeze may not happen immediately, but as the number of available shares decreases, the probability for an imminent squeeze gets better since the hedge funds will be margin called and have to buy to cover. In fact, the longer this goes on, the more epic the squeeze becomes at this point. They're still short >100% and the number of float available becomes less and less everyday as more people buy and HOLD. Its really only a matter of time...so keep the faith!"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185643.csv|StockTicker|['EALLY', 'GOOD', 'SPOT']|[]|['LOT', 'GME', 'M', 'OUGHT', 'STILL', 'UK', 'THEY', 'WILL', 'HOLD', 'NOT', 'HOLD']|['GME']

However, the actual situation between the two companies could not be more different. GME was never really at risk of bankruptcy. GME always had more cash than debt and was paying back debts ahead of schedule, because it has a flexible business model where it can easily close down underperforming stores, which GME did in large numbers this past year. In place of the underperforming stores, GME is expanding furiously into e-commerce. With RC now at the helm strategically, its future is bright.

AMC is in the exact opposite situation. It operates theaters, which it cannot close down without permanent, serious consequences. There is very little room for AMC to cut operating losses during the pandemic. There is no e-commerce pivot. It has theaters, and that's it. For a while now, AMC has been teetering on the edge of a cliff, facing a massive debt load and mounting operating losses, while hedge funds were relentlessly building short interest on its stock like a flock of locusts. AMC had been just a step away from Chapter 11 several times. The shorts almost won.

****This is where we come in.****

The recent rise in AMC's stock price is not just a middle finger to the short interest hedge funds. It is a lifeline to the **real world** operations of AMC. A few days back, one of AMC's debt holders [converted $600 million worth of debt into stock](https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-silver-lake-swaps-debt-for-equity-as-cinema-chains-stock-surged-1234682417/), and there were additional share offerings and other debt conversions.

>It an SEC filing this morning, AMC said it will be issuing around 44.4 million shares of Class A common stock to Silver Lake and related noteholders in the transaction, which will reduce its debt by $600 million.

>Earlier this month, AMC stockholder Mudrick Capital Management also swapped AMC debt for equity, in this case 14 million shares, plus another 8 million as a fee for separate loan.

>As part of its recently announced fundraising, AMC yesterday finished issuing a further $300 million of equity at $4.80 a share.

>It’s been a wild ride for the nation’s largest exhibitor but CEO Adam Aron told Deadline Monday that the chain should have cash enough to ride out the year.

Now, a valid concern might be that the additional stock offerings will increase float and ease the pressure on the shorts. But that didn't happen! The good news aspect of these moves significantly outweighs the additional float. With the freedom to raise capital and reduce debt load, the threat of bankruptcy is all but gone. The shorts will not win anymore, it's just a matter of how much they lose. 

This movement is legitimately saving a real American company. This is not patriotic jingoism. AMC, by the nature of its business, employs US residents and supports local economies across the entire country. AMC is a huge corporation but at the same time extremely local and intimate. The vast majority of its screens are in the US, with a solid representation in Europe as well. Yeah, the popcorn is overpriced, but at least it's going into the pockets of US residents and circulating in the local economy. 

And the enemy? Bloodsucking vampire hedge funds who literally produce NOTHING and do NOTHING except amass capital through underhanded and despicable means. 

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to smash those hedge funds and save a beloved company at the same time.

This is not financial advice. I just love the stock, and hate hedge funds."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185637.csv|StockTicker|['AMC']|['AMC']|['AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'RC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'A', 'SEC', 'AMC', 'A', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'CEO', 'AMC', 'US', 'AMC', 'US', 'US', 'THING', 'THING', 'I']|['AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC']

Over the last couple days of fuckery, it's entirely possible the shorts have managed to close out of their very lowest postions and re-entered new ones higher up. It's possible original shorts have abandoned the game, but new players have entered. We have no way of knowing the position of the short, just that there is one. It's possible certain places have covered their shorts. But that doesn't matter. Don't let that get in your head.

What matters is the short interest %, and by any account, that has either flatlined, gone down only the slightest amount, or even gotten larger. That is the key. They haven't backed down. Maybe shuffled the chairs on the deck of the titanic, but still steering straight for the iceberg. 

I'll use Tesla as an example. You know how shorts lost billions against them? Well, it wasn't because of a short squeeze, it's because people kept buying and holding and buying and shorts kept leapfrogging their positions thinking it *had* to go down. It hasn't. What we've seen the past two weeks is simply two years of the Tesla battle vs shorts played out in fast forward. 

It's simple math at this point. Regardless of current price or point where they entered their position, shorts have to pay interest. It costs nothing to hold. 

It might not be a violent squeeze like VW 2008, but until those fuckers back off trying to short this to excess levels and the short interest % comes down, it's a steady march to five digits."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185652.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['VW']|[]

Just like Tesla that almost went under, it got an almost cult-like following, people are rooting for it to win against the big guys, and succeeding at that. 

Both are about something that the boomers in suits don't understand so they try to shut it down to keep the status quo(electric card, e-gaming, ecommerce) and the everyday retail investors are buying, rich people are buying and giving it more attention online, this is just starting to gain traction, next week will be nuts.

even after the supposed squeeze, the price will most likely stay relatively high, and the company will be relevant for a long time, even if wall street tries to intentionally shut it down again, it won't happen again, so this is good. deepfuckingvalue might actually have saved a company and changed many ordinary people's lives without knowing it

They have previously completely taken away buying power on these stocks from you guys, this caused serious backlash by users of the app forcing them to re-allow trading of these stocks, but not without a catch. There are purchase stock and option limits, which fluctuates throughout the trading hours to clearly manipulate the market, as seen with $BB and $GME today.

There also been plenty of people posting liquidation of their stocks without their approval, probably due to borrowing money on margin, but typically you should still have 5\~ days to fulfill the margin equity percentage requirement.

Anyways, that's besides the point:

What makes you think these retards won't fucking limit selling due to ""technical issues"" or have ANOTHER ""outage"" AGAIN. They'll let the hedgefucks liquidate, then allow us to sell after all the hedgefucks are out. C'mon tards you've seen this shit before during the SPY put days.

Price: 140.99  

Average Outstanding shares: 179.69M

Currently owns:

Tinder, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Hinge, PlentyOfFish, Ship, and OurTime totalling over 45 global dating companies.

The growth rate of users on dating apps worldwide has been steadily increasing:

[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/dating-app-market/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/dating-app-market/) 

Of these, Tinder is the most popular by a significant amount; hence, I will use that as my example to illustrate some points going forward:

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/826778/most-popular-dating-apps-by-audience-size-usa/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/826778/most-popular-dating-apps-by-audience-size-usa/)

[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tinder-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tinder-statistics/)

Facebook growth rate:

[https://www.statista.com/chart/10047/facebooks-monthly-active-users/](https://www.statista.com/chart/10047/facebooks-monthly-active-users/)

The tinder to Facebook comparison is not intended to illustrate that tinder could ever get into the same level of popularity of Facebook; it is much more niche. Rather, the comparison is to illustrate that the growth rates have similarities proportionally.  

Key factor in business model:

Tinder has two primary sources of income. One of which derives from monetization, which has proven to be extremely fruitful for all social media apps thus far.  

Most importantly, they have a subscription based product, Tinder gold for only $15. This has proven to be extremely successful as 6 million of their total 57 million users use it. That’s 10% of their total users, that specifically chose for the paid model. To put how vast this percentage is into perspective, YouTube has about 2 billion active users, while only 1.5 million are subscribed to YouTube red for $5.  

What makes tinder gold differ from other traditional free app optional subscriptions:

Unlike many subscriptions, tinder gold does not simply remove the ads from the UI. People are paying for two things primarily; they are first paying for the potential to have their profile be seen by others more, since it is extremely competitive. More importantly, they are also able to see the profiles of people who like them. This is a huge factor, because without it, tinder does not allow you to see who likes you. It forces you to continue swiping on random people until you stumble across someone who liked you. Due to basic human nature, people want to immediately see what people liked them, they want to cut to the chase. Therefore, they are required to sign up for tinder gold in order to see them.

Another huge money maker for tinder is the profile boosters. You can pay a certain fee, in exchange for tinder’s algorithm to push your own profile into more peoples feeds for a finite period of time. This results in significantly more likes and matches. These are not points or games, these are real people, so many often get a rush from this and continue to use more and more boosts after they see how affective it is.  

These being only three sources of their income alone already should illustrate how advanced Tinder is in terms of marketing their products. Tinder preys on basic human nature, and it has resulted in incredible user and financial growth.

Many of these other dating apps that are owned by Match include very similar marketing tactics. Again, I used tinder as an example simply because it is the most popular, and allows me to simplify some of my points regarding these dating apps. It is also the most profitable, due to the impressive marketing tactics I explained

“The company revealed Tinder pulled in $1.2 billion in revenue over 2019, a 43% increase from 2018. Match owns several other high-profile dating platforms including Hinge and OkCupid, but overall revenue for the year was $2.1 billion meaning it gets more than half its revenue from Tinder.”

Total balance sheet:

Anecdotal notes:

Perhaps some investors will shun me for even considering anecdotal experience to be note worthy, but I do feel that if some individuals have experienced something, it is more than likely to have occurred outside of that individual experience as well:

A large problem with dating apps is that there is a stigma to meeting someone online, or even having the apps downloaded. Several years ago, I remember seeing jokes about people who “needed” to use tinder to find girlfriends. I even remember seeing memes about people trying to hide the tinder app three layers deep into a hidden folder on their phones. This stigma certainly still exists, but from my experience, it has certainly decreased. It’s no longer about “needing” to use the app, it’s becoming more normalized. The popularity charts I provided illustrate this as well. Many people don’t even use tinder to meet people; many simply use it to entertain themselves or meet people virtually.

The stigma is dying, and as it continues to die, there will be continuous increases in users. The largest stigma was actually buying the subscription for “Tinder gold”, which gives you a select amount of features. However, even this is becoming more normalized. People can justify it by simply wanting to see who likes them, rather than being for the benefit of helping your own profile be seen. Curiosity didn’t kill the cat in this case, but it influenced over 6 million users to spend at least $15 a month. 

Entry point?

I figured now would be a good time to make this post since they are coming off a recent sell off. The support has not proven itself yet, so it certainly has more temporary downside potential. Regardless, if you’re in it for the long run, this won’t matter as much. Watch for potential support Monday, 

This post will probably be brushed aside due to the short squeeze focus point at the moment, but feel free to share your thoughts if you do end up reading this. I’m very open minded and completely accept that I can very well be completely wrong on this. I mostly would like to hear people’s thoughts regarding the key factors of the business model I mentioned. I really do feel that they are next level in terms of preying on human psychology. It’s extremely impressive marketing in my opinion from a scientific perspective at least.

I have been investing using fundamentals for a while and I was recently thinking of this overall new dynamic which the market hasn't seen.

With the rise of social media, this was bound to happen sooner rather than later and this whole GME situation might be the tipping point.

Thinking back to Apple and the whole 1984 ad, one can think of that to be a certain meme multiplier back in the day. In fact I think one of the reason Apple is still valued so highly on the market is because out of all the other large tech they actually have the highest MM. Buying Beats and bringing in Dr. Dre for example is something which increases the MM.

A classic example of a MM (which can be thought of as a ratio if nothing else) gain is when Ryan Cohen tweets this for example: https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1350877969816956934

Of course daddy Musk would have the highest MM so far and the stock prices reflect that.

I will try and come up with a mathematical formula to calculate MM better in the next few days. This is just an idea for now."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185714.csv|StockTicker|['MM']|[]|['I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'MM', 'MM', 'A', 'MM', 'MM', 'I', 'MM']|['GME']

I thought making 5.2M on mattress stocks was amazing, but 50M on Gamestop is freaking Godtism.

Second of all, this volatility in the market is once again creating a good opportunity for selling some high premium puts on your favorite stocks. Currently I am not in these positions, with exception to PRPL and DKNG because I believe the red might continue into Monday.

PLTR- PLTR has enjoyed a nice run up and currently you can sell weeklies that give you about 5% downside protection and will allow you to buy the stock for around 33.00 dollars if assigned. If you go two weeks out then the premiums are even better. I selected a couple of the ones I'd consider selling.  This stock is winning lots of government contracts and recently just signed a large deal with Rio tinto Mining (Go SLV gang). Selling 34.00 - 35.00 puts for 1 or 2 weeks out look nice.

&#x200B;

You all know the story with purple. I just wanted to reiterate, PRPL hit 41.00 on Monday and has been a victim of the mass sell off with no news. I expect a business update soon and I believe earnings and guidance will be excellent. For those with big balls, 40,s 35's are good plays, for those with small little baby balls, 30's are a good play.

&#x200B;

SKLZ- take advantage of the huge Igaming surge. SKLZ is being bought up like crazy by Big Dick Cathie Woods. Selling 30's for big ballers and 25's for small ballers.

DKNG- They just recently released numbers and they beat expectations but fell afterwards. They are on their way back and they grew revenue like mad through the pandemic with most sports shut down. The spending on the Mcgregor fight might also be a good money maker for Q1. I like the 53.00 weeklies for next week or 2 weeks out. 55.00 for the big ballers and 57.00 for huge ballers.

GME- I am not in GME gang, but as you know, the premiums are huge. Selling weeklies @ 150 strikes gives you nearly 205.00 of downside protection!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a capital intensive play, so tread lightly.

This really says it all.

Yesterday there were 100M in 1 DTE SPY puts purchased yesterday, sold this morning. This morning there were tens of millions more in 0DTE SPY puts purchased.

If anyone can verify this with tier 2 data, I would bet that these 150k/100k/75k Put options were purchased in huge blocks throughout yesterday and today.

We've all known that they are going to bleed their positions to keep GME afloat, but this is worse. They're bleeding the SPY. 401k's, retirement funds, the works.

These trades represent capital generation of somewhere probably in the area of 500 million dollars, which is enough to get them through a couple days of kicking the GME can.

Someone smarter than me needs to work out what we do with this information.

EDIT: Before anyone says ""hur hur no proof it was them""...

So most of the news and social media memes about GME boils it down to being the result of an obscure meme ticker being intentionally rallied up by a group of risk-tolerant self-proclaimed retards who all collectively agreed to buy and ""screw the hedge funds"" because we were ""bored at home"" with stimulus checks or whatever fuck else these jackoffs think we did. Yeah it's funny and feels good, but it's not the whole story. After all we hype around retarded momentum stocks all the time, why didn't CHWY, NIO, TSLA, PLTR, AMD, and SPCE surge 800% in 6 days?


#This narrative is dangerous, and lacks important context about Wall Street's manipulation, greed, and how this whole thing ACTUALLY started.


If this narrative is pushed and becomes believed and accepted, then Wall Street and the SEC could actually have a case for accusing retail investors and WSB of market manipulation. But in case you're new that's **not what happened**


This was the complete and sole result of large firms short selling at a gross rate for over a year, while simultaneously working to push down Gamestop's share price through manipulative tactics like ladder attacks and media hit pieces. They could have covered at $4 for huge gains, but it wasn't enough, They were fully intending to run Gamestop into bankruptcy during a pandemic for maximum profit.


Eventually WSB autists picked up on this and bought the stock **for good reason**, not to collectively just ""fuck the shorts"". Those good reasons include the 148% short interest, GME being undervalued at 4% their revenue, etc etc. You guys know the deal.

This info was spread through WSB as early as last July by our holy Lord &amp; Savior DVT. Hype over GME went on for months here and eventually it was enough to begin the spike. The spike grew as other firms bought in too and news went viral. And yes, other firms are buying in too. No, your friend on Facebook who just downloaded Robintard to buy 1 share at $310 isn't the biggest one ""holding the line"". Even if 25% of adult Americans owned an average GME position of $300, that *still* leaves institutional investors with ~70% of shares. Yeah we're having a HUGE impact on markets right now but don't be naive and downplay the fund's positions too.

Obviously what's happening is incredible, and I'm diamond holding shares &amp; options to the fucking andromeda galaxy🚀🚀🚀🚀

But please try to correct the narrative where you can, and add the important context. It can make the difference between retail investors getting legal protection or being regulated out of existence.

TL;DR: WSB sparked this but greedy and manipulative Wall Street short sellers were the gunpowder and don't let anyone forget.

&#x200B;

I noticed the premium for selling a call way out, say January 2023, is 320.5, on the $2 strike

So now, shares of GME are 312.

So in theory, if I took my $31,200 and bought 100 shares, and sold the $2 call, even if I just met the ask, I get 320 premium. So my 31200 becomes 32000, and eventually 32200 after the call expires and I get an extra 200. But essentially I turned 31200 into 32000 with no effort. So 800 per contract sold.

Obviously volume is low, but say I could do this 200x (which according to asks, it's 320.5), that's 850 profit per contract (32,050-31200). So now I can take my 32050 and do the same, and eventually, after 36th one sold, I can then start selling 2, etc. And after my 200th, which takes up all the volume for the ones that profit an average of 850, I have an extra $170,000.

Obviously this cannot be correct. What am I missing?

&#x200B;

TLDR:

&#x200B;

Buy a stock for 31200, sell a covered call and get 32050. That's a profit of 850. Rinse and repeat until you have sold to all the asks over the share price, 200x. Not only are 20,000 shares locked up for a bit in long term options, but you have gained 850 profit 200x, which is 170k.

&#x200B;

WHAT AM I MISSING? Where does this go south?

&#x200B;

Edit: The answer is I forgot to account for the fact GME closed at 324, and the bid is 320. So you would lose 400 per trade. Now if it followed the meeting in the middle of the Bid ask spread then it would be a 150 profit per trade, but only 76 of those exist. Thanks  u/boblawslawblawg

A PREFACE: DO NOT XFER OUT OF RH. THIS ADVICE IS FOR NEW BUYERS ONLY OR FOR THOSE WHO HOLD MORE THAN 5 SHARES IN RH AND WANT TO BUY MORE. ANYONE BOUGHT ON RH, DISABLE STOP LIMIT. DISABLE MARGIN, AND HOLD ON CASH.

Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further WE GOT TOO FUCKING BIG!. GOOD! due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

🚀🚀Fidelity and Vanguard🚀🚀. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. They will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Holding $250k 🚀GME🚀 [proof]( https://imgur.com/ylnsvES). I was a permabull until I hit the submit button on this post

Now that I got your limited autistic attention with the troll-baiting title. Now that I’ve won you over to my side with my retarded fucking yolo position on 🚀GME🚀, I am going to share with you my prediction on stock market as a whole for the next six months. 

#TLDR
Hold 🚀GME🚀 until Citadel is dead. Puts on anything a few months after that. Wall street will win in the end but I’ll come out on top.

#Where we are today
It’s not hard to argue that we are in a large bubble of epic proportions. We had COVIND shut down the world economy and less than 1 year later the SPY is trading up 65% from the bottom. Meanwhile we have tech stocks like TSLA up over 500%. I don’t think this is sustainable and we are overdue for a bear market. 

“Okay, so what will happen?”
Good question!

#What will happen
##Short Term (1-4 weeks)
This 🚀GME🚀 short squeeze is going to trigger, and it will trigger soon. Once the short sellers get margin called the price of 🚀GME🚀 is going to rocket up to incomprehensible levels. (I’m holding till $69,420) Some hedge funds will die out, maybe we kill off a broker. Who knows, maybe a too bank if we’re lucky. The retail investors will get a win and the overall stock market will be okay.  At $10,000/share the market cap is only $700 billion. This is a lot to us, but not enough to actually impact wall street.
Maybe 🚀GME🚀 is just the start and wsb starts buying up other over shorted meme stocks. I don’t know, but i wouldn't bet that wall street will let us get more than one win in-a-row.  

Once the 🚀GME🚀 squeeze is squoze we move on to the mid term.

##Mid Term (1-3 months)
In the case of 🚀GME🚀 retail won and hedge funds lost. Wall Street doesn’t like losing and now they know that we can hold them by the balls and start a short squeeze on other stocks with infinite risk involved to the hedge funds.  
For example, If the short float ratio for a stock is 70% and wsb goes in and buys up 40% of the shares holding them in diamond hands, guess what happens. We artificially limit the float causing a short ratio of more than 100%. 
The hedge funds will see this coming and start to off load their shorts before they get stuck in another short squeeze. 

While this is happening the hedge funds will be buying back stocks at an increasing price. Since retail won with 🚀GME🚀, and now that they have all this new money with a risk tolerance of a mentally disabled gorilla, they will start buying up all these stocks little the dumb kids they are. It’s going to look like retail is about to start another new type of bubble that will last forever. A bubble built on the speculation that meme stocks will short squeeze again and again. A **squebble™** if you will. Really what is happening is that the hedge funds are exiting their short positions and taking the loss before another squeeze starts. We will know this is happening if the over shorted meme-stocks start raising in price while the short shares start declining. This brings us to the third and final term. 

##Long term (4 - 8 months)
Okay quick recap: 
We’re in a bubble
hedge funds are closing shorts
retail is buying up everything. 

This is going to be the end of short selling to this extreme. Not because of regulations, or fines, or prison time, but because we now have the power to abuse the system against them. Hedge funds or brokers won’t allow this type of overeverage from happening again. Since short selling is a very profitable tactic that is now off the table, the value added in from the margin trades will diminish and the stock market is going to decrease in value. Hedge funds will see the writing on the wall and start to move into safe investments. Maybe they go into cash, maybe into gold, I don’t know. I’m just a 25 year old engineer who doesn’t really know shit about the stock market or where money flows to in a bear market. 

#End game
Still here? Great! Follow me to the epic conclusion of this 2 page novel. 
Hedge funds are moving money into safe investments before the impending bear market. Retail, however, is still high on life like a fucking dipwad huffing paint buying up everyhting under the sun. Pretty soon the hedges and retail will stop buying because of exhaustion (It literally can’t go up forever, sorry bulls 🤡)  We all saw what happens when there is no one to buy a stock thanks to Robinhood removing the buy button. In this case it will be because no one will buy since everything is way too overvalued. **This is when everything comes tumbling down.** It will start with the risky meme and tech stocks since those are what wallstreet will exit from first. Then it will cascade into everything else. 

We are about to witness a bubble pop larger than anything ever before. This time the game has been changed against wall street and only an epic bear market will remove retail from the big kids table once again. 

#Positions
1. Short term: 100% 🚀GME🚀 baby! [proof]( https://imgur.com/ylnsvES) 💎👐

I am not a financial advisor. This is a DD (Due Diligence) post in regard to the upcoming squeeze aimed at AMC. The information is a collection of research from credible sources with some of my personal thoughts on the topic.

NOTE: ANYONE WHO IS INFORMED ON THE MARKET AND HOW IT WORKS, SKIP TO PART 2.

This DD will cover more than average DD's since WSB has gained a large following of new traders who can benefit from a full description.

Part 1: $AMC, what is it? 🎞️🎟️

---[Source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Theatres)---
AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. is an American movie theater chain headquartered in Leawood, Kansas, and the largest movie theater chain in the world. Founded in 1920, AMC has the largest share of the U.S. theater market ahead of Regal and Cinemark Theatres.

Part 1.2: What is a squeeze?🤏🏼

A squeeze in the market ($GME, $AMC) is a phenomenon that occurs when shorts have to be covered, especially by high class traders (hedge fund managers). 

Part 1.3:What are shorts, why are they popular with the top 1%?

In short selling, a position is opened by borrowing shares of a stock that the investor believes will decrease in value by a set future date . The investor then sells these borrowed shares to buyers willing to pay market price. Before the borrowed shares must be returned, the trader is betting on the prices decline and then can purchase them at a lower cost. This stategy is HIGH RISK HIGH REWARD.

Part 1.4 (final intro peice): Why do squeezes cause losses up top?

Simple. In the case of $GME the hedge funds bet that $GME would fall. Logically, they should have been right. But as I'm sure everyone knows, WSB and working class investors from all over the world flipped the trend on its head. So, since the hedge funds bet on a fall they had to cover the losses caused by their BORROWED positions becoming absolutely useless (nice). 

Part 2: The stats on $AMC. 📈🧠

---Paraphrased from ""Yahoo Finance"", Some IMO.---

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 101.95 million shares. Now what everyone is waiting for it when shorted shares become useless and the hedge funds have to cover what they bet and lost on. Today's target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 and we closed at $13.29! This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Feb 1/21) So Monday when they're forced to cover the $8.63 they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher from said stimulus. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96.  Over the next few trading days it is going to be a strong squeeze. $AMC is standing where $GME did a week ago. Hold your ground. Gains coming in hot next week. 

Part 3: What are our targets for buying and selling?💵📈💵

THIS REQUIRES DIAMOND HANDS 💎👐

From what I have read, buying into $AMC at $17 or below is a safe bet. My exit plan is to secure some profit next week as the squeeze reaches it's height, and reinvest (into $AMC)  a comfortable amount based on collected gain. I plan to keep shares for up to 12-18 months so long as $AMC keeps on the track we can see now.
AGAIN, I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. MY WORD IS NOT LAW.

Part 4: Beware The Big Man (Reason for Holding)🏦🚫

Big money managers and short sellers are going to manipulate the stock in the after hours session to scare us investors out of buying and holding with the intent of executing their shorts as planned or to cushion the blow from failed investment. Again, 👐💎.

Part 5: The Conclusion on $AMC in short (wording wise) 🚀🚀

•The statistics on this stock are legit. 

•The company is longstanding (70+ years)

•The company is legit

•A squeeze is seemingly inevitable

•Being the largest theatre company, post COVID gains are likely as cinemas will re-open.

•The hedge funds are in a position to be bent over again via their shorts in $AMC.

•Last but not least, I know alot of you autists lost alot of money gambling during highs on $KTOV, $XSPA, $GNUS, and many others... So why not get some tendies for once.

--------------------------------

AGAIN I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, THIS IS A COLLECTION OF DATA AND RESEARCH BASED ON RECENT TRENDS AND $AMC's POSITION IN THE MARKET AS OF CLOSE ON (1/29/21)
I AM NOT LIABLE FOR LOSSES OR THE REASON FOR GAIN.
THIS POST IS STRICTLY FOR SHARING INFORMATION GATHERED.

---------------------------------

TL/DR: 💎👐📈🚀🌑

Edit: Monkey brain was on overdrive while typing, I know shorts do not expire but monkey brain like thinking about put options.

Been on WSB for the past month and have been watching the GME antics unfold. Last Sunday my cousin came from out of town to plan are attack on GME. He arrives and I invite my other buddy to joins us  to discuss our  plans for Monday morning 
 to purchase shares/options of GME. 

I had this burning sensation in my soul that I was going to make a-lot of money from this. I was planning on spending my entire portfolio (only about 1200 at the time)on GME calls/ shares. We stay up all night watching in awe as GME breaks through the stratosphere, shaking in excitement of the day to come. I begin getting lost in my thoughts about how I will distribute my winnings with my loved one especially my mother. 

I grew up on welfare after my parents split up at an early Age. My dad fell out of the picture and  my mother raised my siblings and I while she  attended  college/worked full time in hopes to provide us a better quality of life for the years to come. Years later My mother succeeded  in receiving  her degree and became a special Ed teacher and was able to make enough to support us. I have always wanted to be able to pay her back for everything she did for my siblings and I, I thought this would be my time. 

The morning comes along and I am refreshing the calls GME every second in hopes of scoring a calls. The page finally load and  calls where far  out of my budget, feeling the disappointment over come me I make the decision to buy 6 BB calls instead. The Next day comes around I’m down -700 in calls and there is GME calls for 1/29 that are only 390 a contract. What happened next will blow your mind, instead of jumping at the opportunity I had been waiting for I decide that i shouldn’t cut my losses just yet on my BB contracts and see if I can make some profit before  I purchase the GME contracts,(quite frankly one of the biggest mistake I’ve made in my life). 

I run a few errands and an hour or two goes by before  I check my phone and am swept over with The realization of how fatal of a mistake I have made. The life inside of me leaves my body and I am filled with an aching pit of agony as glazed eyes stare at my phone screen to see my 4 contracts would have been worth 80k, my knees buckle I am now sick to my stomach. Granted I probably would have paper handed my calls the moment  I saw 20k in profit and creamed my pants. The day goes by and I am over ridden with crippling depression. The next day comes around I sell my BB calls for 1200 profit which is the most I’ve ever made on a trade. How ever instead of celebrating this victory,  I feel like it is nothing  but an immense failure. 

Don’t get me wrong I am extremely thrilled we got to fuck over the Hedge-funds  and happy for every body who has been able to make massive  gains, but I cannot get rid of the feeling that I missed on the opportunity of a life time. I cannot go on media without being reminded of my fatal mistake and it makes me sick. I am thinking of temporarily deleting my social media and taking a break of trading until I get over this. The depression is real I’m a working class guy and make maybe 35k a year, the money I would have made would have been life changing, and that’s what’s makes this pill so hard to swallow If anybody else is experiencing this immense FOMO hang in there don’t be a bitch and we will get over this or possibly not."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185654.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['WSB', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'BB', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'BB', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'BB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'FOMO']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Things like paintings and sculptures by Picasso, Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons and other celebrated artists.  Things that they see beauty in that, perhaps, others subjectively disagree on.  

Anyway I think its mind-blowing what I've put together, but it's a different kind of art - I'm obsessed with ticker symbols. When I go to my brokerage, I see museum quality and beyond, incredible ticker symbols that I see as art - ones you just don’t find in everybody's brokerage.

When it comes to buying a random combination of letters, I am purely from the gut and I know right away. If it stays in my brain—let’s say I go see a ticker, if I keep thinking about it, I know it’s something I like. If I forget about it, then I know, couldn’t care less...

My collection doesn't includes signature, quintessential works of sought-after tickers - I just like certain letter combinatuons. 

You know what a perfect day is for me? A perfect day is going down to Vanguard, or Fidelity, or if I'm slumming it Robinhood, and I just look at letter combinations and then grab lunch—to me, perfect day.

While I almost never sell at a profit, the investing aspect of letter combinations has never been part of the allure of collecting for me—I do not approach it the way I buy physical disks of video games, or sell them when I'm done playing them to recoup value...

I probably enjoy looking at letter combinations that I appreciate more than one that I don't appreciating.  But I don’t think the financial part is a big part of it. I don't like to make mistakes.

You can’t collect random letter combinations at my level for losses over many years and not have a real passion for it—at the end of the day, it’s not going to change my life financially.

Below, a cross-section of my random letter combination collection in my brokerage account.

# Look, Listen

This past week has been a moment where the proles have been able to figure out a way to steal from the rich legally. We found a “cheat code” as has been referred to on the news. GameStonk, har har. They, the rich have rebelled and acted illegally in plain sight. And they truly, truly believe they’re going to get away with it. Like without a doubt they don’t think they’re going to lose. They think they’ll just continue to manipulate the market, pay for lies on every news outlet, and have our elected officials cast us as the bad guy. It’ll happen.

# But it doesn’t matter.

Cause some of us have an income stream through all this C-word nightmare we’re living in. And, …

# CAUSE WE’RE NOT GOING TO STOP BUYING GME

So Shorts, keep digging in

Cause some of us that are tapped. Get a bit more munitions for the **war effort** every 2 weeks.

Ask yourself, what would you do if you were in Melvin’s shoes? Would you give up and capitulate to a bunch of mouth breathing basement dwellers or fight back? 

So what do we know? We know that the media is spinning the narrative that Melvin “closed its position”. 

Does this mean they exited their short? Maybe, maybe not. 

Given the current short interest (over 100% by most sources, maybe even 250% by others) and the consensus that they did not have time to fully exit the position when they said they did, one conclusion is that their position was not exited but still remains. 

Is it possible that their pride would not allow them to be defeated, and they pledged, assigned or otherwise sold their position via derivative or other structured offering to a trusted third party, to give the illusion that they exited, thus causing WSB and other longs to sell off?

There are two Citadels. Citadel the hedge fund (HF- Cohen) and Citadel Securities (MM). 

We know that Citadel Securities pays Robinhood (and others) for our order flow. Using this data, they are in the best possible position to see when sentiment is on the sell side for Citadel HF’s newly acquired Melvin short position.  

Of course it is absurd to think that these two Citadels don’t interact or share data because there is a “Chinese Wall” between them. (Time to take a tequila shot.)

We also know that Cohen, via Citadel HF, “loaned”” or “invested” nearly 3 billion to Melvin as a lifeline. What we don’t know is how this money was allocated, or for what purpose.

One theory is that Melvin used the money to purchase calls of various strikes and expiry on GME to hedge its losses. (There is another post about this topic.) This seems unlikely for several reasons better explained in that post. 

Another theory is this 3 billion was the magical number to “close its position.” Unverified, so let’s assume for now it’s not accurate.

Given the hubris and big dick swinging energy of these funds, another alternative is that they wanted their cake and to fucking eat it too. 

Ask yourself, what is more likely: they (1)!exit and go quietly, accepting their losses to a bunch of independent amateurs riding the short bus; or (2) be the greedy AF as history has shown time and time again?

Perhaps they didn’t “close the position” but assigned it to Citadel HF, which is well capitalized. (Possibly even with the caveat of buying it back). 

They then use the Citadel capital infusion to load up on GME shorts right before Citadel Securities (via Robinhood) restricted trading. 

Capital could also be used to gobble up shares when GME went into free-fall with those calculated ladder attacks or when GME shareholders were stopped out.

Citadel HF then rides the existing Melvin short position down to the ground, profiting on that trade, as WSB and other longs capitulate due to restrictions and other fuckery.

TLDR: Melvin Capital is still a part of the short interest and has not closed its position.

At some point, Gamestop is likely going to offer stock/rights/whatever to capitalize on their increased value. This is a good thing for the company, and for shareholders. 

For the company, they can make a fairly small offering and gain a ton of money to bankroll future growth or their pivot to e-commerce. For the shareholders, it serves as a floor on the stock price. Consider, if the company offers 35MM shares at $300. That would give them $10.5 billion in their war chest, for 100M shares. This is immediately a bare minimum value of $100/share just in book value. Add in their enterprise value and even the bear case is $150. This would legitimately give them a bull case over $500/share. This would force shorts to cover, while leaving the short percent at ~60%. This would still be a massive squeeze and set up the company for the future.

Alternately, the company could issue a rights offering, which is basically an option to buy. Each shareholder gets 1/2 a right, which can then be traded. If the rights are at $300/share, then they are worth the difference between that and share value. But also, shorts are then short a right as well, incentivizing them to cover, or else they'd have to also cover the right. This acts as a dividend and a share offering. It would *also* raise cash for the company and increase book value, especially if the company finds a broker to guarantee it, saying that they will exorcize any unexorcized rights.

This is one of the benefits of having a high stock price - the ability to raise funds. It's what has allowed tesla to grow as rapidly as it did. And it becomes synergistic. High stock price allows companies to raise money, which in turn helps push their price higher.

These are the same people that colluded with Charter Communications back in the day, in what is fondly called “the Summer of Love”. They’ve been able to charge us monopoly prices by divvying out the map and deciding to only provide cable in certain areas of the map, so if you’re in those areas you have one little choice. This allows them to make the price anything they way. Although we have Netflix and slightly more cable options, till this day our internet and broadband providers are 10x slower and 10x more expensive than countries like South Korea. They have no business telling us that we’re doing is immoral or criminal!! Especially when we take down evil suits named Melvin *spits out of respect*.

All throughout this, CNBC seemed to be the main perpetrator of the hedge fund narrative because they are the worst of the worst and defend establishment assholes like themselves. There is nothing else to that. I worked there for a year and it was all psychopaths. Straight up. End of story.

Anyway, I think we all hate Fox, CNN, OAN, and all that other BS but if you still take CNBC seriously, I hope this experience changes that for you. May they rot in hell. Like Robinhood, Citadel and Melvin, they are an enemy of the degenerates, of the retards, and of the 💎🤲s. And they represent the 🌈est of 🐻s.

They also bought calls that expired on Friday to profit when the stock went back up.

What's to stop the hedge funds from continuing this strategy until they drive the price down enough and get enough profit from calls FDs so that a squeeze won't happen? I don't think the SEC really cares about retail investors and congress is all talk and no action. I feel like the game is rigged. They're gonna find a way to get out of this unscathed...

**1. Hedge Funds don't create value, they can die**

If they go bankrupt who fucking cares? They don't create any value, they just bet on companies and in some cases drive them out of business for the sole purpose of making money. Wether you believe in GameStop's fundamentals and financials or not there was no reason for its stock to be at $4 dollars, and ultimately put 14,000 people out of their job, ever.

Even on a personal level, all those suits have money set aside in tax havens, I'm certainly not worried about them, we still won't ever get close to 1% of their net worth.

**2.** **HF are taking everyone down**

Looking at this week's events they're basically fucking everyone over. They're fucking the brokers who are out of liquidity because of financial requirements therefore have to limit trading etc, the clearinghouses who have to protect themselves by asking for 100% of collateral on those trade which impacts the brokers, us, ultimately the banks. And they are tanking the market by closing large positions in BABA, SPY, whatever just to stay afloat.

**3.** **Only Wall Street isn't on our side**

Who is against us? Only the crooks! No one else is saying ""Yeah 140% short is perfectly normal, it shouldn't be illegal, they need to be saved."" The world is watching, all the peasants on the planet want to make them pay, politicians from all parties agree, we're backed up by ""celebrities"" and the likes. Honestly I've even read some decent articles.

**4. 2008, pandemic, Biden**

Do I need to remind anyone about 2008? Do I need to remind anyone we're in the middle of a pandemic, people are out of jobs, businesses are closing, healthcare workers are overworked? Biden just took office, does he want to fuck himself over in his first week? And he won't go for a second mandate so he might as well take them out.

**All in all**

Given today's situation, I want to believe that the government can't leave the retail investors hold the bags after this is over. I can't imagine the repercussions this would have if we are betrayed by everyone and the scumbags get bailed out billions given the current state of the economy. It is also a truly unique opportunity, knowing 2008 precedents, to finally put them against their crimes and improve the system.

**One more thing, institutions own 70% of GME**

Let's say everyone is on our side, stars are aligned. Institutions like HF don't care about us and probably don't care either about taking down other HF. They have the upper hand, what hand are they playing?

💎🖐🚀🌕

TLDR; Melvin and co should die, they don't create value. It's a domino effect, because they don't want to cover they're taking down the brokers, clearinghouses, the market, us, ultimately the banks. The world is watching, everyone is on our side but them. 2008 memories, pandemic (distressed population and economy), Biden has been in office for 1 week. Isn't it in everyone's best interest that they don't get bailed out and that we aren't left bag holding? However institutions (including HF) own 70% of GameStop, even if it all goes well, we could still be fucked over, what hand are they playing?

Edit: I even want to add BLM to general public sentiment (wether you agree or not - we are apolitical), redistribution of wealth and to some extent positive repercussions for charities and the economy."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185643.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'HF', 'BABA', 'SPY', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'HF', 'HF', 'I', 'BLM']|['BABA']

This subreddit has seen a surge of 5,5m people in these last days. That's a lot of people and thats great. But I think theres a few people that don't know a lot about the short squeeze and are here for a quick buck.

if you thought you could profit by the end of this week, this was not the case. The shorts at Wednesday gained an advantage. Imagine if we could stop the market when we had a red day. We would all be billionaires by now. That's what they did. 

I still think the squeeze is still in play though. This means, this will not be as quick and they expect new people to lose interest/panic sell so they can cover lower. It's all or nothing for them. They could pull more insane stuff by next week, you can count that as a possibility. 

That's why its important to understand the play here and not just jump on the hype wagon. You're doing more harm that way. Learn about short squeezes and educate yourself on what has happened till now. 

TLDR: I believe the squeeze is still on. But due to Thursday, it may have gone back a week or so. Due to a surge in people here, they may expected a squeeze to occur on friday. And I could imagine that hedge funds bet on new people losing interest. That's why its important to educate yourselves, To make your own opinion about the stock.

We're based in Europe and as far as I can tell, there are only american Silver futures available (CMEgroup). I don't have experience in trading futures.

So here are some open questions regarding this:

Can we as europeans trade CME silver futures and can we let them deliver to a warehouse in our Country? If yes, what about shipment costs?

reference: [https://www.cmegroup.com/confluence/display/EPICSANDBOX/Silver](https://www.cmegroup.com/confluence/display/EPICSANDBOX/Silver)

There it's mentioned that March is an active future month. What does that mean? Physical delivery can only take place in march?

Additionally, fellow europeans - any idea about upcoming taxes for the physical delivery? We have to pay VAT for buying silver here as far as I know.

So - do you think the physical delivery is even possible? Also to Europe?

let's do this!

e/ I'm already long slv/pslv and silver options. And with slv I mean a european a fully backed european version ""Xtrackers Physical Silver ETC""

e2/ why did I even ask in here! Does anybody even read the text? I know it requires an attention spawn of more than 20 seconds, but come on...

e3/ Some of you didn't fully comprehend, that it's all about getting silver physically. As far as I know, the Papermarket is 250 times bigger than the physical market. A Shortage in the physical market will potentially cause moon prices.  Just read the DDs on silver from the last days:

After Trading212 pulled the same shit Thursday, I was wondering if there are equivalent UK apps?

As I understand it:

* Freetrade - Uses a third party and restricted some US stocks (Edit: Freetrade state this was due to their currency exchange house refusing to change sterling for USD)

* Revolut - Uses a third party (Edit: Generally positive ITT but no ISA wrapper)

* Etoro - Uses a third party and restricted some US stocks

* HL - Terrible app, long order fulfilment time (Edit: Some people ITT say it’s great though and only experienced issues at open)

* Saxo? (Edit: Loads of people rate Saxo)

* Degiro - Seems popular on the continent but no ISA wrapper 


I probably can’t switch now because I prefer to trade in an ISA wrapper but looking for an alternative post April.

It’s unraveled so quickly, primarily in an arena hardly understood by many, that it’s not surprising the real human story would somehow get tangled within the misinformation of social and corporate media. The story arcs are so complex and the threads so wrapped up in a frayed society that it’s difficult to trace them back to the supposed players in any given corner. The entire world, since this devastating virus hit, is a testament to that. 

It would be a disservice to any reader to demarcate these players and their roles in this game because you likely already have your own understanding of who they are and what their objective may be. And if not, there’s a plethora of information strewn across the internet. This letter isn’t meant to sway or convince you of which corner of the ring to hang your hat on. It's my own personal synthesis trying to make sense of all the forces at work here, and it’s an entreaty for every reader to zoom out and take into account the blooming dynamic of an increasingly fractured society, and hopefully come to your own conclusions about how we all got here.

Now, more than ever, we have been using actions over words in an attempt to be heard. And this particular week, the drama played out on Wall Street between Hedge Funds and millions of individuals, and has become another dog-eared page in the history book of whatever the hell we’re going through right now. 

It should come as no surprise that millions of individuals emptied their linty pockets to put forward whatever money they had in order to back a company that had been shorted to oblivion during a time of crisis and quarantine. These are the same people who got tangled in the outdated bureaucratic unemployment system, or were forced to work because they were suddenly deemed essential. And yet they still struggled to find ways to pay rent, buy diapers, food, and worry about the ramifications of contracting the virus not because they feared for their life, but because the medical bills were more of a death sentence than the virus. 

Meanwhile, these short sellers maintained their long positions, which were essentially tantamount to rooting for the death knell of one of the few companies actually helping many stay sane during the quarantine; second, perhaps, only to any local animal shelter. Once lauded as virtuous for rooting out fraud within corrupt companies, it’s become clear that short sellers lost their path somewhere along the way, which isn’t a surprise, really, because the entire concept is that they’re betting on something to fail for their own benefit.

And here’s the thing: almost everyone on this WallStreetBets subreddit bought into this company because, you guessed it: they like the stock. When it was announced that Ryan Cohen (the man responsible for putting those Chewy boxes on doorsteps that were infinitely more valuable to pets than the toys in them) became a board member, enthusiasm shot through the roof. The so-called “tendies’ only became more juicy when WSBers realized the hedge funds held long shorts, due to the intrinsic value that many believed GameStop now possessed with a newly added visionary board member, and the faith that they could pivot from their old business model into a highly successful new one.

More and more individual retail investors read the due diligence written and posted by numerous Redditors over the course of several months last year, and also threw their money behind the company. And then when the hedge funds’ initial long contracts expired: they doubled down. And retail investors still believed in this stock, so they kept buying it. And then hedge funds doubled down again. Instead of cutting their losses, the hedge funds KEPT. DOUBLING. DOWN. Which brings us to the immediate present, and the entire maelstrom playing out before our very eyes. 

What initially started as a very enticing investment opportunity for retail investors quickly morphed into what was effectively a hedge fund throwing around billions of dollars to save themselves from the absurd and somehow still legal short contracts they placed in the first place. And in reflecting on everything that happened in 2008, it should come as no surprise that millions of individual retail investors would legally do whatever was in their power to actually hold these hedge funds accountable for their actions this time around. 

At this point, no one really knows what happens next, and there are numerous possibilities as to what the fallout may be. And to offer any speculation could be construed as potentially misleading, and harmful, at worst. These are the facts as one individual sees them after much due diligence and synthesis. What each and every one of you does with this information is your own responsibility. 

Power to the Players,

The calls with the highest open interest were 320 and almost everything between 100 and 200.

So what I am confused about is how does this benefit retail GME shareholders? I understand it decreases the amount of available shares which only helps load up the rocket to Alpha Centauri. However, what is stopping hedge funds from buying the contracts before close themselves and exercising, allowing them to start getting an advantage in owning more shares? Once they own the shares can't they just sell covered calls on them into next week and start making enough to make back a portion of losses? Is there even enough shares available to allow everyone to exercise?

EDIT: Thank you for the replies! I understand better now.

One last question:

Of course shorts will not willingly be covering at 500%+ losses and will try to drag this out as long as possible in hopes that us retards cave in. Ultimately, is the thing that will set this off the brokers who will start closing the shorts for the hedge funds at any price because hedge funds are unable to meet margin requirements and pay off their interests?

Put on your reading glasses because your autistic ass doesn't get a TL:DR on this one, and you degenerates don't get any fucking emojis from me either.

*Ahem*

The Gay Bears had run a casino for a long time, and the house was rigged. The Retard Bulls who played knew this; but some were able to get lucky; so the other Retard Bulls mostly just looked the other way while the Gay Bears stole millions and millions of dollars from the Bulls' parents every ten years or so.

Until one day an especially autistic bull named Diamond Hooves learned how to count cards, and sought to get rich. Counting cards is not illegal, and Diamond Hooves secretly employed his method of card counting at many different tables in the casino, and he made a lot of money. But Diamond Hooves was very upset with what he saw while he won his money in the casino. Many other bulls were losing money to the Gay Bears, and it made Diamond Hooves very sad at first; and then very angry.

In his contempt for what the Gay Bears had done to his autistic bretheren, Diamond Hooves started to teach his secret method of card counting to every bull he knew. Once he was satisfied that he had educated enough of his bretheren, he led them to the most vulnerable table in the entire casino. The intention was clear, the Retard Bulls had all gathered of their own free will for a single purpose: To sit and play at the table where the Games Stop.

Diamond Hooves was very clear about his table selection, and he had indeed chosen the right table to bankrupt the Gay Bears. This was becoming clear to other Retard Bulls who had not yet decided that they wanted to join Diamond Hooves in counting cards at the table where the games stop. Unfortunately, the Gay Bears also knew that their casino could lose all of its money if too many Bulls counted cards at the table where the games stop; and they had a plan to defeat the bulls.

The Bears employed strongarm tactics to scare the bulls away from the table at first; but this only drew more bulls in. The Beears then stacked the decks against the bulls; but so many bulls had come to the table that it didn't matter. The bulls knew that they had to be willing to be bagholders. They had to be like Diamond Hooves.

The Gay Bears lured the bulls to other tables that would only serve to delay victory at the table where the Games Stop, and sucked them in to the losing tables with false comforts like movies and blackberries. Eventually some of these poor Bulls lost all of their money; but some were able to take the money they stashed away while watching movies and eating blackberries and take it back to the table where the Games Stop. If they had not done this; the battle may have been lost to the Gay Bears.

The Bears had one final set of tricks up their sleeves; and they disallowed any more Bulls to sit at the table where the Games Stop, and then limited new arrivals; and they started a program of disinformation. The Bears sought to villify the Retard Bulls playing at the table where the Games Stop, and they also sought to cover their losses by luring other bulls  into the casino so that they could lose money while eating blackberries and watching movies. It was never forgotten the the Bulls playing with Diamond Hooves at the table where the Games Stop were the good guys, or that the Gay Bears were the bad guys. Too many bulls had been bankrupted. Too many bull families had been kept in poverty for too many generations. The Game had to Stop.

To this day Diamond Hooves is still sitting at the table, calling his bretheren to count cards and bankrupt the casino. More and more bulls are joining, and the stakes keep getting higher and higher. Can you hear him in the distance?

""Remain at the table where the Games Stop with Diamond Hooves!""

""This does not work unless you are willing to hold an empty bag with Diamond Hooves!""

""Don't be distracted by movies or blackberries or anything else. Come play with Diamond Hooves!""

""Come to the table where the Games Stop with Diamond Hooves!""

So, we all remember the first attack on WSB last week, resulting in the sub going private for an hour so that the mods could get things under control.

If you recall, it was a pure numbers game. Insane amount of obvious bots with brand new accounts spamming tickers and 🚀 with no other actual content.

It was extremely easy to spot and report suspicious accounts. Mods took control quickly.

They have adapted. **Quickly**. The manipulation is currently much more sophisticated.

HFs underestimated individual investors and currently find themselves in a world of trouble. Do not make the same mistake they did. Consider the following:

&#x200B;

Every time you see a post that is ever so subtly guiding your attention away from GME, or has a general tone that the squeeze is basically over, or is giving good SI indicators about other potential squeezes etc, open their profile and do the following:

* **Posts**. Things to look for:

1. What were they posting about a few weeks ago. If its only topics unrelated to finance/investing➡️suspicious
2.  When was the last time they made a post before starting to post about GME/investing. If theres a time horizon greater than 2+ weeks between their usual activity and current GME squeeze posts➡️suspicious . 
3. *Telltale signs*: Account has a long history, posting about topics unrelated to finance and investing. Out of the blue, successive GME squeeze related posts. 

* **Comments**: 

1. Scroll through the comments to get a general sentiment and feeling of how “real” the account is. If they seem to be parroting a lot of GME squeeze related stances in great succession, followed once again by a time period cushion before their usual comments on other unrelated topics ➡️suspicious

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I will not repeat what everyone has heard and is already well aware of by now. We are in a historic event. The stakes are high. Huge sums are involved. Recognize the magnitude of the situation and approach every interaction with caution. Social media manipulation has been “solved” over the last decade, be constantly aware of that. Any information you read, always do your own research, on the topic and on the source itself.

And, of course GME 🚀🚀🚀

EDIT: In regards to the 2+ week time horizon between non finance topics and GME, that only applies to POSTS that are very confident in their advice. Obviously that doesn’t apply to comments. People have naturally gravitated from non finance topics to this historic event over the past few weeks(5m+ new members in a week says it all)"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185640.csv|StockTicker|['DD']|['DD']|['WSB', 'GME', 'SI', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'POSTS']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

I eventually created a reddit account but even then took a while to actually join the sub rather than just lurk.  So I was here for a good number of the ""fun"" moments of the last few years.  The box spreads that ""literally can't go tits up"".  Everyone piling on puts on snapchat.  Good 'ol Su Bae.  The great paper trading competition of 2019.  The ousting of ""he who shall not be named"" (the automod removed my post for mentioning his name).  Etcetera, etcetera...   But this will be my first post.

Over the last week and especially the last 24 hours, I've seen a LOT of comments in the pinned threads lamenting the fact that WSB is forever changed and that it's time for another paper trading competition.  I want to speak to that for a moment and if the mods would be so kind as to keep this post up I'd be very grateful.

First of all, yes, WSB has changed, but that's a *good thing.*  You know who else doesn't want change?  The hedge funds, and Wall Street.  The whole point of this thing that is happening IS CHANGE.  The fact that the world is standing to attention right now says something about this is real and that is much more important than being able to remove some noobs because their IQ is too high.

Even worse than the comments calling for noobs to be eliminated, I've seen many commenters dissing people who can only afford small amounts of shares or even fractional shares.  So now WSB is elitist and you have to be wealthy to join and have fun in the markets?  NO!  That's the entire point of this place and GME and this week is that the market SHOULD NOT BE FOR THE ELITE ONLY.

**Have 5mil and want to invest?  Great!  Have $5 and want to invest.  Great!**

WSB endlessly attacks CNBC, etc for not being able to see that GME is NOT about WSB or the fundamentals of these companies, or about making money.  But it's about something much bigger.  And those people who are crying out for all the noobs here to be banned are no better than the entrenched elite like Stephen Weiss who yesterday called this whole thing ""load of crap"".

We all saw the open letter pinned earlier this week and the responses to it.  We all lived through last year.  And for the first time in a VERY long time, I feel like the world is coming together to unite rather than to divide and it feels f'ing GOOD.

Let the moment stand for a bit.  I promise you that eventually people will forget about this and we will all start attacking each other again and most of the noobs on WSB will never set foot in this place again.

But for now, for today, for this weekend, and maybe a while more, let's be excellent to one another and not decide the worth of someone over how long they've had a reddit account or how much money is in their band account.

So to all the noobs:

Welcome!  Hope you enjoy your stay.  It gets a little weird around here, so it would save you a lot of time if you just gave up and went mad now.

Due to your actions last week you forced many of us to make a decision of what platforms we will be using to trade from in the future. I personally moved all of my funds from RH to another platform. What you may not realize is that there are a LOT of people who did this as well. All of my funds will become available to trade with on Monday morning as I'm sure many other peoples will be too. 

You fucked yourself and your friends... as come Monday morning will be a whole lot more capital ready to be reivested in GME, AMC, NOK, BB and what ever the fuck other stocks I LIKE.

Edit 2: It seems some people are still asking if its too late to buy. I value this stock at $4206.90 and that's what I'm willing to walk away with. I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. With that being said... a life with out taking risks is a life having to wear a condom EVERY FUCKING TIME while you continually pound Melvin's Ass.

Edit 3: Next step.... we reached 320 this week and that was our target. Congrats all my fellow degenerates as we held the line. As you can see they are now offering up to 800 on next week's options. That's our next target. The squeeze could happen or it may not happen next week but we have a target in sight. They are trying to do everything in their power to suppress our valuation. Hold strong autists. We set the price. Prediction: GME opens Monday 500+ and we continue on our mission.

Edit 4: A lot of people are asking me questions about what happened. I was trading GME since Jan 11th as a broke ass bitch, I threw in $200 played a nice $26 call before we spiked to 32 I was excited and cashed out to turn that into 30 shares of GME and hedged my way up to 55 shares over the following weeks. Im not rich, I think I just played this right move.
Now here's what happened on Thursday... The Robinhood app blocked me from buying so my plan was to do a hedge on multiple platforms. Sell half on RH and rebuy after the inevitable ladder attack on my Webull account and then transfer my money there as well from RH. When I sold on RH they literally sold ALL of my shares not just my available shares since the others were locked up in limit sells. I panicked after that happened. And bought in as many as I could on my low funded Webull account. So I had to essentially sit out for the day. Friday full RH transfer hit my account and I set up a new account.
Atleast I sold at around 380 and was able to buy back in below that. I owe about 70k in medical debt and GME gave me a chance at making up some of that, I'm +25k on a $200 investment, I need this.

Act like you have insider information and are about to short the housing market back in 2008.                                                                         3. Stock goes down 10%, so naturally freak out and sell everything, realize your loss. Get mad at the hedgefunds and say “fuck it I’m going to make it back”.    4. Eureka moment “stonks only go up”.                            5.

We saw in the last days that the system is rigged and there is no justice for us. I dont care where Citadel will be fined some time in the future, that will be too late for us. SEC should act accordingly now, but we all know thats not gonna happen

In 2006, Goldman Sachs GS, -1.40%  , as the great cephalopod is officially known, was shorting distressed high-yield bonds from a bathroom-fixtures manufacturer called MAAX Holdings Inc.

As a result, his total exposure exceeded the entire issue of the MAAX bonds. Falcone then stopped lending the bonds, so that short-sellers could not liquidate their positions anymore. The price of the bonds rose dramatically. The short-sellers could only liquidate their positions by contacting Falcone directly.

The funds are accusing Porsche and its former chief executive and chief financial officers, Wendelin Wiedeking and Holger Härter, of market manipulation and of disguising their aim to buy more than 75 per cent of VW’s shares in order to take full control over VW. “The complaint alleges that the defendants repeatedly misled investors and lied about Porsche’s positions and intentions with respect to VW,” the funds said in a press release.

No, I wasn't paid by Melvin to deter your cause. I'm mostly looking for people to tell me why I'm wrong because all the posts I see are full of shit and are so overly emotional that they seem to lack any kind of logic. Everyone was saying there will be a short ladder attack before close, there wasn't. Everyone was saying there will be a gamma squeeze if we close over 320 and there wasn't. Friday was the first time when I didn't feel I understand what is actually happening - does anybody? Something feels off and we might even have been lead into a trap by Melvin or other hedge funds for them to recoup their losses, So please hear me out first.

(1) Public attention hit its maximum on Friday after being already extremely high on Thursday. It will likely subside rapidly next week especially if we have big dips.

(2) Most calls in the money were probably bought by people who actually don't have the funds to cover them. AH, suddenly 4 million shares were traded (after 40 million) for the whole day, the price dropped rapidly. IMHO what happened is that RH automatically liquidated 40k calls ITM because the holders didn't have enough funds to exercise them (i.e. for a $115 call you need 11500 in your account). This freed up the need to hedge those shares and they were immediately sold.

(3) Calls are now available up to 800 and they're actually not as expensive as you might think, so it's actually possible to hedge shorts quite effectively at this point. If the price doesn't hit $1000 soon, it will be very hard to squeeze. And we need to get there with buying shares only against people who can probably load up on shorts still and without the buying pressure of a squeeze and with considering (1).

(4) Short interest might still be 120%, but these are now people that shorted between 400 and 500 and are already hedged with let's say 600 calls.

(5) A squeeze to infinity would take down brokers and probably the entire market. Do you really believe this is going to happen? Don't be ridiculous. They can change the rules as they please and they did it before.

(6) There are two many players involved now. Before it was an easy story. One hedge fund fucked up their risk management and redditors fuck with them. Now you have people who just FOMOed in and actually have no clue about the underlying squeeze and gamma squeeze theory (because IMHO it actually doesn't work anymore). You have other hedge funds for which I don't know if they're actually going for the squeeze or just trying to get as much money from retailers piling in. What if they loaded up on short all the time around 330, then let the price fall to 250 and buy back in just to give the illusion that retailers still control the situation? To me the price movements look extremely professional, this IMHO is not retail driven anymore. Even if they go for the squeeze. What tells you that they will not be the only one capitalizing on it leaving retailers holding the bag? They know the game 100 times better than any of you and _will_ screw you over.

(7) We actually don't know who is short where and how it's hedged. Simple as that. Before it was Melvin shorted probably around 50 and in deep shit, now who the hell knows. We don't know if they actually covered. There's also dark pools btw. Just because volume was low is not a guarantee this didn't happen.

I thought about this long and hard. Here are IMHO the possible outcomes.

(A) People lose interest next week. The price will fall, people will panic sell. And a lot of you people will lose a lot of money you can't afford to lose. I feel extremely sorry about that because I really liked the movement.

(B) The government will intervene and offer $10k to every GME holder per share to resolve the situation. The money has to be paid by Melvin, regulations will change etc. I think this is highly unlikely as it feels unfair to the people not joining.

(C) The squeeze will go to infinity, each of you will be a billionaire and wallstreet will completely collapse together with the global stock market, because everyone in power who could have easily prevented it by just changing the rules will think it's time for a revolution and it would be unfair towards retailers to intervene. If you believe that, you are seriously retarded, and not in a good way.

(D) The price will keep going up a little bit, but it's not a squeeze. It's orchestrated by hedge funds to make their money back from all the people piling in believing they are still fighting although the battle is already lost. Once they realize, people lose interest the price goes to zero and people will lose everything.

(E) We will have more pressure and there's actually some squeezing going on. It could go to maybe 5000 before the government steps in, halts trading and most likely forces gamestop to dilute shares. Force because Gamestop really enjoys the attention and would draw a lot of hate doing this. But actually getting a lot of free money would probably be more attractive still, so they might do it even without being forced once they can negotiate a good deal with Melvin or whoever is interested to buy the shares at a reasonable price.

Don't get me wrong. I believe in the movement and I'm immensely proud of everyone showing immense solidarity fighting the right fight, just don't be only led by your emotions, also stop to think and add some logic.

I'm still long 100 shares, because I might be wrong, but I just feel after Friday the risk is significantly higher. Please safe, only invest what you're happy to lose (because this is the most likely outcome) and don't forget to try and understand what's actually happening.

Edit: After thinking even longer and harder I now realize that the total amount of shares is super low and that's right there a good *logical* argument why after all this might work. None of you idiots pointed this out to me though. Good luck everyone. I'll hold my remaining shares, now that I have more than just an emotional reason.

Here is what happened this week.

1. The week started with a big push into GameStop. GameStop is a company that by most accounts is/was struggling to build a profitable financial model. Their 52 Week low was $2.57 per share. Giving them a Market Cap of roughly $200 Million.
2. Melvin Capital, a Multi-Billion Dollar hedge fund has shorted the company (bet the stock will go down). In fact, somehow Melvin Capital has managed to allegedly short roughly 140% of the shares, borrowing more shares than are actually in existence. Side note: when you buy a stock, you can only lose the money you invested. However, when you short a stock your losses are theoretically infinite.
3. The extreme short position by Melvin Capital created a potential buying opportunity which was identified months ago by Reddit user DeepFuckingValue. If you can buy enough stock and options of a highly shorted company, the short seller (Melvin Capital) is forced to take losses. They may also need to rebuy shares to settle margin calls which can cause the stock to go up even more.
4. Over the past few months DeepFuckingValue's positions in GameStop have become something of legend, as the price went from his initial purchase price of around $5 per share, to opening the week at around $90 per share. Along the way both retail and institutional investors have gotten behind DFV and the short squeeze.
5. One famous investor who invested big behind DFV is the legend Michael Burry who you may know from The Big Short. He put a large buy position on and is rumored to have made well over $300 million.
6. By Tuesday night the stock is up HUGE closing the day around $145 per share
7. We enter what is known as a Gamma Squeeze this is a cascading effect that occurs when prices move up quickly against short sellers. Quick Analogy: If a short squeeze is fast like a Corvette, a Gamma Squeeze is fast like a Tesla in Plaid mode with a Space X Rocket booster strapped to it (we will get to Elon later).
8. Wednesday morning: ""We Like The Stock"". Stock moves to over $300 per share and closes the day over $350
9. The band of retail investors, Robinhood traders, and heavy hitters grows huge on the buy side. Elon Musk steps up, for those who don't know Elon, in addition to being the richest man in the world he also is likely not a huge fan of Melvin Capital as he went to battle with them when they tried to short sell Tesla
10. Melvin Capital's losses are reaching a point of potentially financially breaking their entire fund, allegedly, Citadel steps in to lend a few billion to help bail out Melvin Capital.
11. A Battle Cry is let out ""We can Stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent""
12. Thursday morning GameStop opens up to an insane upswing and hits over $450+ per share. DeepFuckingValue is man of lore as his initial $50k investment is now worth over $50m
13. Here is where things get dark...
14. At this point in time Robinhood and a few other brokerage houses stop allowing traders to buy GameStop. Betraying their own user base. They only allow you to hold or sell. Allegedly from many reports, Citadel who helped bail out Melvin Capital is actually one of the biggest customers of Robinhood. To better understand how this might have happened, Robinhood operates as a platform that allows traders trade commission free, but part of the business model is to then sells the data of how retail traders are trading to large institutional players like Citadel. In other words, if you are using the product for free you are the product and your data is being sold.
15. According to Justin Kan ""Citadel reloaded their shorts before they told Robinhood to stop trading GME""
16. GameStop Shares drop from $450+ per share to $130 per share in a matter of minutes as many traders literally are only able to sell.
17. The list of big players supporting GameStop erupts. Names include: AOC, Dave Portnoy, Mark Cuban, Elon Musk, and Chamath Palihapitiya all who are outraged by the events. Many call for the founders of Robinhood to face potential jail time.
18. WallStBets Reddit channel explodes to over 6 million users.
19. Shares climb back slightly on Thursday to end the day just under $200 a share
20. Friday opens with a big step up, Opening around $345. Robinhood allows some highly limited purchases of GameStop. Despite limitations, the share price holds closing the week at around $325 per share.
21. GameStop is now a $22 Billion company
22. DeepFuckingValue is on the front page of The Wall St. Journal.

It's very easy to get polarized and split groups down the middle, into ""us vs them."" While I agree that we stand united against abusive practices in the market, I don't think a majority of the people here have a proper appreciation of it.

**Short sellers are not the problem here.**
Short sellers are a necessary part of our markets, part of a ""healthy ecosystem"", if you will.
- Short sellers helped expose the housing credit fiasco banks were running that led to the 2008 crash, and if they hadn't, it could have ended up much worse. 
- Short sellers helped expose Valeant, a pharmaceutical company that was hiking the prices of live-saving drugs, because they knew people had no choice but to buy those drugs. 

In 2003, a statement was written to the SEC by James Chanos that further elaborates:

*""Many of the major corporate frauds and bankruptcies of the past quarter century were first exposed by short sellers doing fundamental research: Enron, Tyco, Sunbeam, Boston Chicken, Baldwin United, MicroStrategies, Conseco, ZZZZBest and Crazy Eddie are but a few examples of this phenomenon.""*
https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/hedgefunds/hedge-chanos.htm#:~:text=Many%20of%20the%20major%20corporate,few%20examples%20of%20this%20phenomenon.

We need short sellers.

💎✋💎✋💎✋
**What we DON'T need are groups that artificially short a stock into oblivion through uncovered (naked) trading.**
💎✋💎✋💎✋

That's what these hedge funds, and others, were doing. They wrote contracts agreeing to buy/sell a ton of shares at a certain price at a certain date... except they don't actually *have* the cash to be doing this with. What they were hoping to happen was keep the price down to ensure that the contracts would be profitable without ever needing to actually own the shares or have the cash to begin with.

And if you don't care about the cost of buying shares... then what's stopping you from just writing as many contracts as you want? Free money, right?

Well, they got caught with their pants down. Short interest on GME skyrocketed to 140%, and people sniffed something fishy reeeeaaal quick. Now, these firms are getting screwed because they'll be contractually obligated to buy the shares at whatever price we can sell them for.

In my mind, there's a powerful moral in this story for everyone here, especially newbies: **NEVER. SELL. NAKED. OPTIONS.** This should be *Trading Safety 101*.

Kids, if you want to sell a call option and collect that juicy premium money, you better own 100 shares of that company for when the piper comes calling. Likewise, if you want to sell a put option, you had better have enough cash to *actually buy* 100 of those shares at whatever price you picked.

Most brokers will enforce this on individuals, **but these firms and market makers are getting a pass, and I think it's time for that to end.** There wouldn't be any need for bailouts if people quit doing stupid shit, and if the executives responsible were actually held accountable (unlike 2008.)

Sincerely, some random Theta that just wants this whole thing to be over so I can get back to selling *covered* calls on my shares of BB, AMC, and so on, without waking up to find out they all jumped 1700% in one night. Sheesh.

Listen you retards. I will explain the logic of why GME needs AMC and AMC needs GME.

GME feels like a late ship for many. GME is not attractive to many people out there at this levels, just the commited ones. AMC is the second most shorted stock here with big hedge funds on the other side. Chartwise, they moved the same.


For GME to rocket, it needs AMC hype. People will want to get in at 15$/share now that the company is not bankrupt anymore and feels like a realistic fair valued company which was kept to the ground with shorts.


GME needs to hold it's own a bit until AMC loads up on people. 

GME is WSB short squeeze.
AMC is the rest of dumb retail short squeeze.

They both need the fomo and hype of each other to pull this through.

AMC might have even more support if you think about Hollywood and stuff like that and that it might get boomers interested in saving their memories from AMC.


TLDR:.  AMC NEEDS GME, GME NEEDS AMC.

BB, NOK are not short squeezes . End of story


Edit: if AMC was a diversion, they would have not limited the share at 1 as well. They are both fucking the shorts now that's why they limited both of them.


Edit: DONT FUCKING PULL OUT OF GME FOR AMC, WE NEED TO GET AMC GOING TO GET GME GOING, THATS WHAT I SAY



AMC

44.3m shares shorted last time was disclosed.

101m float

37% tutes ownership

That leaves around 60m float on market

44 out of 60 is over 70% short.

Let's call him Melvin. He thinks he's really smart. He finds a coupon for $5 off the new Nintendo Switch during the holidays with no limit on number of units. This is easy. I'll go ahead and sell the Switch now for $200 and then buy it for $195 with the coupon. Easiest $5 I'll ever make. He goes and tells all his parents' friends at the Citadel Country Club that he can get them the new Nintendo Switch for their kids. He collects $200 each from 200 parents. He now has $40K and will use that money to purchase Nintendo Switches for $39K. He'll have earned $1K in just a few hours. His parents will be so proud.

There's another kid watching Melvin this entire time. Let's call him Keith. Keith doesn't like Melvin. Keith is good friends with the guys over at Gamestop. He finds out that there are were only 100 new Switches shipped to the entire country. Keith and his 99 friends buy all 100 Nintendo Switches on the spot.

Later in the day, Melvin goes to Gamestop with his $5 off coupon and says, ""I'll take 200 Nintendo Switches please."" Gamestop guy looks at him and says, ""Sorry, we're all sold out."" Melvin goes to the next Gamestop. Same story. All sold out. He goes to all the Gamestops in the city and can't find a single Switch. He won't be able to fulfill the orders.

Meanwhile, Keith is telling all his friends about what Melvin promised the members at the Country Club. Nobody sell him the Nintendo Switch that you bought, no matter how much he offers you. Nobody likes Melvin, so everybody holds on to their Nintendo Switch.

Melvin is in trouble. His parents rich friends are all asking when they are getting their Nintendo Switch. Melvins parents are angry, but they don't want to lose their standing in the Citadel Country Club. They have to help Melvin gets 200 Nintendo Switches.

The price of Nintendo Switches in the city skyrockets. Melvins parents were able to get a few units from Keiths friends, but they had to pay really inflated prices for them, first $1,000, then $2,000, now $3,000. It's nearing Christmas, and every rich parent at the Country Club is desperate for the Nintendo Switch they promised their kids. They can't trust that Melvin will be able to get them one. They all start bidding against each other for Switches. Everybody in town is in on the action now. Everybody wants to get a Nintendo Switch to sell at the country club for $10,000.

We don't know how when shorts will be margin called. Remember: SHORTS DO NOT EXPIRE.

What we know is that Q4 earnings report is coming. Cool. So what's the deal?

&#x200B;

Here's an interesting fact from recent Holiday Sales report:

>E-Commerce sales, which are included in comparable store sales, rose 309% and represented approximately 34% of total company sales, with total worldwide E-Commerce sales year to date  reaching over $1.35 billion, far exceeding the Company’s $1.0 billion growth objective.

# Do not underestimate this.

&#x200B;

We perceive this company not as a next Blockbuster, but as a next Netflix that can adapt to changing circumstances. GME's online sales are growing each and every quarter in a rapid pace.

This company is transitioning faster than you can correctly spell ""retard"" and we can help it accelerate to velocities of a fucking rocket ship.

Did you know that GME has other brands under its shield?

I've broken out my robe, my pipe, and my helmet so that we can sit down and contemplate the most singular and engaging question of our time:

> If you were a short what would you do if you were SUPER fucked but you knew in two days you were going to be SUPER DUPER fucked? 

That's the question that we're faced with this fine Saturday morning. But let's do a quick review of the facts to understand where the shorts are possibly at before trying to answer that one.

**Current short situation**

* According to the DD floating around here we're still at 100% short interest - at least.
* Melvin and Shitron say they're out of their positions. But are they? 
* Doesn't matter. New shorts are still short and will be forced to cover. 
* We saw liquidity dry up Friday with a bid ask gap of like thousands at one point
* Shorts launched multiple short ladder attacks
* Reports of whales coming in an buying up the shorts shares during the attacks, short can't keep that up
* If shorts can't short attack because of the whales hoovering up their shares, what can they do? They have to buy eventually.
* ~~Oh and then there's the big gamma squeeze coming from Friday.~~ Ok looks like the gamma squeeze may have occurred [already](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8e9f3/read_this_if_you_expected_a_huge_gamma_squeeze/). Thanks to /u/BlueEstee for that DD - they definitely have more wrinkles on their lobes than me!
*~~All call contracts expired ITM Friday. Any naked calls must be covered. More importantly - MMs will be forced to gamma hedge existing contracts for further out expiration. They do this by buying shares.~~
* Retail is now buying out of spite. Which is the best kind of investing I think.
* I chew crayons. I put that together from what's here. If I did you know the shorts brokers did as well. Margin requirement increase anyone?

tl;dr shorts current situation

> They are SUPER DUPER fucked early next week because of the incoming gamma squeeze, likely increasing margin requirements, whales getting involved and of course continued retail interest.

Much of this is a summation of DD by /u/jkn_ku so read their post if you want a REALLY good blow-by-blow of Friday with some really keen insights on order flow sniping and things I had no fucking clue about: [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/).  I know, I know, /r/investing but goddamn if that isn't some killer DD and it reads like a fucking action thriller. Respect.

**But what's the shorts next move?**

The shorts have had a lot of tactics to scare off retail - ladder attacks, PR blitzs, lots of bots, etc. But they have ONLY ever had one move - the move they HAVE to make eventually. And that's of course to buy back the shares they owe their brokers. They're under contact to do so - it's the law.

But that's what will cause the MOASS and force them to buy from retail, right? That's what we want?

Yes! But there are other longs out there other than retail - institutional longs. These are usually big companies or funds who purchase gme for long term strategies. We haven't talked that much about them.

Here's a list and the amount of shares they own from an Investors.com [article](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/gme-stock-gamestop-investors-instantly-make-16-billion-gamestop-stock-squeeze/).

Holder |Common Shares Held (Millions) |% Of CSO |Gain ($ Billions) |Position Date Update
---|---|----|----|----|----
FMR (Fidelity Investments) |9.5 |13.7% |$3.0 |Sep-30-2020
Ryan Cohen |9.0 |12.9 |2.9 |Jan-10-2021
BlackRock |8.6 |12.3 |2.7 |Sep-30-2020
Vanguard Group |5.3 |7.6 |1.7 |Sep-30-2020
Susquehanna International Group |4.4 |6.3 |1.4 |Sep-30-2020
Dimensional Fund Advisors |3.9 |5.7 |1.3 |Sep-30-2020
Senvest Management |3.6 |5.2 |1.2 |Oct-07-2020
Donald A. Foss |3.5 |5.0 |1.1 |Feb-28-2020
MUST Asset Management (SOLD STAKE!) |3.3 |4.7 |1.1 |Mar-18-2020

I want to be clear. Longs only represent 51.m shares. And many of these are funds that probably cannot sell due to their fund balancing requirements and what not (I don't know - just guessing there). 

Shorts are shorts AT LEAST 100% according to all of the DD we've read. They still have to buy ALL of retails shares. There is no way that I can see for them to avoid doing so. But they WILL try to lessen the pain. 

And these institutional longs are seeing BILLIONS in gains (with a B) so who knows what could happen.

So I am speculating that the shorts will approach institutional longs over the weekend for some sort of deal. So keep your eyes and ears open and helmets strapped on tight!

This is not investment advice. Don't take investment advice from the internet.

Positions: 1000 shares bought @ 16

APES TOGETHER STRONG.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the awards but please save your $ for gme shares. 

EDIT2: For those of you doubting the willingness of Longs to sell NOW to avoid more volatility, consider that a large gme shareholder - MUST - sold off their entire stake this [week](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/large-gamestop-shareholder-must-asset-management-sold-off-its-stake-2021-01-28).

There are forces at play here that didn't exist during the VW squeeze. The gamma squeezes and sheer idiocy of option buying by you all has created a perfect storm which is what is created all the trading restrictions. There were going to be gamma squeezes every week until the short squeeze was triggered and no institution has the capital to handle weekly gamma squeezes. I think the restrictions has stopped the infinite gamma squeezes which is probably good for the market because it may have created a collapse and we could never buy chicken tenders again.

So back to timing the MOASS and when to sell.  
1. 💎👐  
2. I firmly believe you can't time it anymore. The institutions are much more advanced now and the short ladder attacks which we saw multiple times this week and in 2020 creates artificial drops that make it look the bottom is falling out of the squeeze. (i.e., stop loss is bad)  
3. They are obviously willing to lose ridiculous amounts of money borrowing shares because they don't want to ""lose"" to a bunch of internet 🐒.   
4. This isn't Porsche owning all the shares. Whatever they say, none of us really know what any of us are going to do. We certainly can't coordinate buying or selling because we would have all bought with DFV. So we may see spikes from a hedge fund covering after short ladder attacks or PM/AH trading. We won't know if any of these spikes are the MOASS.  
5. They made this a war of us vs them. This is personal now for a lot of us and we are willing to hold much longer than any rational person would. Some people will probably hold through the squeeze and fall and witness the rebirth of GME by Ryan Cohen and see the shares go back to $100-$300 on its own. **The original thesis**.  
6. Watch the volume. The short ladder attacks occurred during low volume. Volume will sky rocket during the MOASS and even during the ride back down volume will be high. This is black Friday when the doors open and boomer Karens are climbing on top of each other to buy a tickle me Elmo.  
7. Gamestop step in during the squeeze and announce they are going to bail out the shorters.  
8. They are taking advantage of ladder attacks and trading halts.  
9. Without the gamma pressure from options, we may see the stock price drop significantly after they cover from this past week.  
10. We don't know the price point for the shorters anymore. There could be a significant amount of shorters with price points above $100.  
11. **HOLY SHIT THE PUTS!!!! I just totaled the puts for next week. \~149,000 puts from $0.50 to $100. 8,359 puts from $100 to $320. These are all OTM.** There are a lot of puts that are OTM every week in February.

**My Plan**: I'm exercising all my options (vary between $15-$30 strikes) now because I'm worried about lack of buyers/liquidity and stability of the trading platforms for retail during a MOASS. I'm going to adjust when I sell based on what is going on because there has been too much fuckery. I imagine I will sell a large percentage of my stocks between $1000 and $2000, but we could just as easily see a sudden spike from $900 to $2000 in a 5 minute window and then I probably won't sell till over $5000. If we slowly increase over days and weeks (10%-50%) my tolerance to hold will increase and my sell points will adjust.

I think we all need to be prepared for what other shenanigans these types will come up with next week. Here's what I can think of:

1. Some brokers will continue imposing limits on certain securities (what you can buy, how much you can buy, and so on). This will continue to suppress demand.

2. SEC may get involved and [suspend trading for 10 days](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/suspensions.htm) ""for the protection of investors"". This will have an impact on holders of near-dated options. I am most worried about this.

3. Technical outage. There are billions of dollars at stake here (trillions if the stock market collapses), so what's a few ""outages"" that will ease volatility and cool sentiments?

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 1st, 2021.

# **Wall Street braces for bumpy trading in the week ahead as the GameStop short squeeze unfolds - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/wall-street-braces-for-bumpy-trading-in-the-week-ahead-as-the-gamestop-short-squeeze-unfolds.html)**
*****
> Earnings news from Amazon and Alphabet, the important January jobs report and Washington’s discussion of stimulus could all be important to markets in the week ahead, but none of it is likely to get more attention than the short squeezes driven by retail investors.
*****
> Stocks had a rocky week, with the S&P 500 down 3.3% to 3,714. The S&P was down 1.1% for January, its first negative month since October and a warning for the year, according to the old Wall Street adage.
*****
> “We were due for some type of decline. We’ve been straight up since October. It’s not unusual that we’re backing off a bit,” said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities.
*****
> Trading could remain bumpy in the coming week, as the S&P 500 struggles to hold above 3,716 its 50-day moving average and a key technical level.
*****
> “This is the first time we’re at the 50-day moving average since early November,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “It’s just a level we haven’t seen in a while and it’s an important first line in the sand of whether the market uses this as a pivot spot to bounce again.”
*****
> “The buy the dip mentality doesn’t die easy, but if you break that [50-day], that portends something else,” he said.
*****
> Massocca and others see little impact on the broader market from the phenomena of retail investors piling into stocks that are being shorted by big investors. Fueled by no fee trading, retail investors created a flurry of trading in GameStop and other heavily shorted names, like AMC Entertainment. If the stocks rise, in theory, the firms that are short sellers will have to buy stock to cover, and that activity could drive the price even higher in a so-called short squeeze.
*****
> GameStop was the poster child for that trade this past week. GameStop shares closed 68% higher on Friday, bringing their gain for the week to 400%. The retailer’s shares hit a high of $483 on Jan. 28.
*****
> “This is somewhat isolated,” Massocca said of trading in GameStop and other shorts. He said it may not be a phenomena for that long since there aren’t that many heavily shorted stocks. “I think they may be hunting new names.”
*****
> The short squeeze story has garnered broad interest, in the general news media and from Washington.
*****
> Lawmakers from both parties are eager to look into the fact that Robinhood and other online brokers restricted trading in the hottest short names when trading was frenzied. Robinhood said it was responding to SEC rules on net capital requirements and clearinghouse deposits that brokers have to comply with.
*****
> “This was the busiest week for earnings reported with 82% of the companies reported better than expected earnings. It’s a really good quarter, but obviously overshadowed by the short squeeze news,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management.
*****
> He said some of the biggest tech names have been lagging, like Apple and Microsoft.
*****
> “The combination of demanding valuations and short squeeze news has overshadowed a really good performance of corporate earnings so far,” Grohowski said. “We’re constructive on the market. Fundamentals do look encouraging to us.”
*****
> Strategists have expected a pullback in the first part of the year, and many say it would become a buying opportunity. Hedge funds did sell long positions in the past week, but firms like Morgan Stanley and Barclays say the de-leveraging is not likely to have a big impact on stocks.
*****
> But for investors who end up buying in at the end of the short squeezes, they could feel some pain.
*****
> “I do think this isn’t going to end well,” said Grohowski. “These kind of one way trades they don’t end well particularly for those that come later to the party.”
*****
> “I think this will be one of those,” he said. “GameStop is not worth what it is trading for today. I do believe at the end of the day the value of a company is important and it’s going to be driven by fundamentals. These dislocations and distortions of value, they will correct and many will be hurt by that.”
*****
> But Grohowski said it’s encouraging that the surge in retail activity was driven by younger investors.
*****
> “We’ve wanted for some time for this younger generation to be more interested in the financial markets and equity investing,” he said. “I know a lot of experienced market participants were not anticipating it being this way. It’s not just a one time kind of distortion.
*****
> “I think this is thought-provoking in terms of a way a younger generation might be looking at investing, by their rules, not the rules of the traditional market participants,” Grohowski added.
*****
> He expects the January employment report to get some attention Friday, and it should be weaker with just 50,000 to 60,000 jobs added.
*****
> He said the markets will also monitor the progress of stimulus discussions in Washington, as valuations have risen on expectations of a package coming soon. President Joe Biden has proposed $1.9 trillion in spending, but Republicans are not in agreement.

> # How Stocks Perform in a President’s First Year

> 2021 kicks off the first year of a new four-year presidential cycle. One of the most popular questions we’ve received lately is how have stocks performed historically during this political year.

> For starters, the S&P 500 Index historically has gained 6.8% per year during the first year of the four-year presidential cycle, but stocks have done better when the president was re-elected than when someone new occupied the White House. This makes sense, as a new president could bring new policies and potential uncertainty. Additionally, stocks do better during years three and four under a new president, while they are much weaker early in the cycle.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, breaking down all the quarters of the four-year presidential cycle shows that the first quarter of the first year in the cycle is one of only two quarters with a negative average return.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Bigger picture, historically the fourth quarter of the year has been the strongest of the year, with the first quarter the second best on average. Don’t forget, the third quarter is usually a weak one. Please note, below is for all years, not just the first year of the cycle.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> We will take a closer look at February returns next week on the blog, but it is worth noting that when a new party is in power in the White House, historically stocks have struggled from late January until early March. “It is interesting, but from around the time of the inauguration to several weeks out, stocks tend to be pretty weak,” according to LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “It may be as simple as new leadership could bring with it new policies and added uncertainty”.

> # Will GameStop Stop The Bull Market?

> “In the short term, the market is a popularity contest. In the long term, the market is a weighing machine.” -Warren Buffett

> The incredible action from some of the most heavily shorted names has investors everywhere wondering what it all means? GameStop (GME) specifically has taken the country’s imagination by storm, as the stock started the year under $20 per share and this morning nearly hit $500.

> Please note, we aren’t allowed to discuss individual equities, and in no way are we recommending any stocks in this blog, but from a bigger perspective, what is happening here? Basically, individual investors are using message boards like Reddit to find some of the most shorted stocks, then they all pile in at the same time, forcing large institutions to cover their shorts, and thus producing massive buying pressure.

> LPL Research doesn’t think these parabolic moves reflect an overall unhealthy market, but institutions covering shorts at sizable losses may be removing capital from some big cap names. “While these developments could be another sign of excessive optimism in certain segments of the equity markets, we do not believe they represent a sign of a broader market bubble or indicate a major correction is forthcoming,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Don’t forget, overall market breadth is extremely healthy and the credit markets are functioning just fine—we don’t see a repeat of 1999 like some are claiming.”

> Lastly, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, after a 72% rally in the S&P 500 Index (and more in small caps and the Nasdaq), maybe it is simply time for a break. After all, the current bull market has tracked almost perfectly the start of the 1982 and 2009 bull markets thus far, and both of those took a break for a few months starting around this point in the cycle.

> # Most Heavily Shorted Stocks at the End of 2020 and Now

> In the table below, we show the 20 stocks in the Russell 3000 that currently have the highest short interest as a percentage of float. It should come as no surprise that GameStop (GME) still tops that list with 122.97% of float short as of the most recent data for mid-month. That is even after a 21.36 percentage point drop from the end of 2020 when 144.34% of shares were short. It was also the most heavily shorted stock then. The runner-up is Dillard's (DDS) which currently has 83.04% of shares sold short compared to over 90% at the end of 2020. Again, despite that sizeable decline in the percentage of shares sold short, it was also the second most heavily shorted stock one month ago. Of the rest of the top 20, there are six other names with lower short interest than the end of last year. Looking across the rest of the most heavily shorted stocks, Sumo Logic (SUMO), American Well Corp (AMWL), and Sunpower (SPWR) are the stocks that have seen their short interest as a percentage of equity float rise the most. In terms of stock price performance, SPWR has been the one with the biggest rally having doubled YTD. The only other stock that has doubled YTD in this cohort has been GME.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012921-Short-2.png))**

> In the table below, we show the stocks that have seen the biggest changes in the percent of shares sold short between the end of 2020 and the most recent data as of January 15th. Those currently in the top 20 most shorted stocks are highlighted in gray. Across the entire Russell 3,000, 1,777 stocks have seen their short interest as a percent of short move lower in the two week period from the end of December to mid-January. As shown, even after the massive short squeeze that has taken place, GME is actually not the stock that has seen the biggest decline in shorts. Relay Therapeutics (RLAY) holds that title with a 22.62 percentage point decline. That is even though the stock has experienced a relatively smaller move than some of its peers. Granted, a number of other stocks like nCino (NCNO) and Berkeley Lights (BPYU) to name a few have actually moved lower so far in 2020 and have also seen their short interest decline significantly. On the other end of the spectrum, WW International (WW) has seen its short interest rise the most.

> # Funding Markets Full of Cash

> US funding markets are awash with liquidity thanks to ongoing QE purchases by the Fed and the progression of fiscal policy since the end of the year, as well as normal seasonal tailwinds that see more liquidity after year-end balance sheet constraints would roll off. Funding markets refer to collateralized, short-term lending via repo and related wholesale cash transactions.

> Government money market funds that are allowed to conduct repo operations as well as buying Treasury and Agency debt are seeing roughly typical inflows, but those come on top of record share of overall money market funds. As a result, repo rates have been plunging. The secured overnight financing rate, which tracks the volume-weighted general collateral repo rate has fallen to 3 basis points above the bottom of the Fed Funds target range. While repo rates falling below the Fed Funds target range wouldn’t be a catastrophe and some parts of the market have gotten there, it’s not in the FOMC’s interest to have funding rates trading far outside its target policy rate range on a regular basis.

> The solution already exists, of course: the NY Fed has a standing overnight reverse repo facility first introduced back in 2013 which is likely to start draining cash as investors seek higher returns than the repo markets offer. Reserve scarcity, which roll-off brought to bear in 2018 and 2019, is now reserve plenty, and so many reserves exist that the NY Fed will start draining them with reverse repos. Reserve balances will continue to grow this year thanks to QE purchases and an expected decline in the balance of the federal government's transaction account at the Federal Reserve.

> # Federal Reserve Rebukes Hawkish Rumors; Reaffirms Support

> It has been a busy past 12 months for the Federal Reserve (Fed), after the onset of the global pandemic prompted historic stimulus from monetary policymakers. With the economy showing signs of being in the early stages of expansion, some have speculated that the Fed may begin to slow the pace of its asset purchases. Recent comments from some Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members that have hinted that the Fed’s bond buying program could be reduced by the end of the year, has signaled that other policymakers may be thinking that way, too.

> Adding fuel to the speculation, the 10-year Treasury yield has been climbing, breaking above 1% for the first time since March 2020 as the economy has expanded. Meanwhile, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, breakeven inflation rates—the yield difference between Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and nominal Treasuries—have risen to levels not seen since 2018, suggesting that inflation expectations are heating up, although levels still remain largely benign.

This [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8bwtx/why_gme_fundamentals_dont_matter_for_gme_stock/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) explains how you're not just buying $GME when you buy their stock. You're also buying a stake in all the hedgies shorting it. 

Then this [second post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8hxs6/burning_questions_on_gme_no_one_in_sec_will_answer/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) explains how it's not just the hedgies shorting $GME. There's a big bank backing the hedgies; like a too-big-to-fail big bank (TBTFBB).

So all these CNBC boomers taking about $GME fUnDaMeNtAlS are just fucking with us. Here's what's probably the truth (THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. I'M NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. AM RETARDED): 

Since more shares of $GME are sold short than actually exist (~110-120%), we're getting a 10-20% discount on a TBTFBB, AND GameStop's business. This applies at ANY share price as long as the shorted shares exceed existing shares. This assumes there's a TBTFBB backing the hedgies, that the squeeze is successful, and that we sell when the squeeze occurs. In other words, our investment is backed by the fucking US Government.

In game theory, the only way you could have maximized your gains was if you all stuck together, and you did! They had counted on you guys scattering, and that’s why they took out new shorts on GME.

GME was on the cusp of a short squeeze on Wednesday, before they closed off all buying, and did the short ladder attack.

It shows that they’ve learned nothing since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). They play by one primary rule: Heads we win. Tails you lose. And they can change the other rules last minute to drive to the primary rule.

Next, they will try to block/limit buying across RH and more brokerages so there’s not enough volume to drive to the short squeeze. Meanwhile Hedge Funds are free to buy/sell unlimited amount of shares and create short ladder attacks \[1\]. Different rules for different players in this game!

But let’s move back to the whiteboard.

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch.*

Today, I’ll describe what a margin call is and explain a High Short Interestt trading strategy around it. In Particular, I’ll use Melvin Capital presumed short book as a case study.

Note: I’m not a financial advisor, this is just me whiteboarding.

# Long/Short Strategy

In the Hedge Fund industry they have a strategy called long/short. They go long on momentum stocks and short undesirable ones.

Ie buying Apple and shorting Gamestop.

This trade is profitable if Apple’s stock price rises and Gamestop’s (GME) share price decline.

However, let say the trade doesn’t go their way and Gamestop share prices dramatically because of a short squeeze. In this case their net position is negative. Let’s say 30% negative. If it becomes large, their brokers calls them up and ask them to put more cash. Then they raise 30% more cash or sell stocks that been paid off to meet the reserve requirement. This is why you see the general stock market deep red, while GME moons. Hedge funds are selling their winning longs to raise cash for the margin requirement.

When GME short squeezes, they may have to liquidate (sell off all their longs) and cover their existing short position. Moreover, they have other leverage short positions that are also highly shorted (> 50% of the float). This becomes what’s known as an arbitrage trade. I’ll call it the High Short Interest (HSI) Trade. It’s a high risk trade but with potential for very high profits/returns should it go someone's way.

# The High Short Interest Trade

Should Hedge funds start to cover short positions because of a margin call or liquidate, they will be forced to buy up shares in the open market. However, if those shares are scares, it will create a huge short squeeze in which they will have to pay higher prices to meet their obligation to return shares.

I’ll use Melvin Capital as a case study because they have publicly declared they had a high short interest in GME, so most likely be margin called or liquidiated, should the GME short squeeze happen.

Furthermore, I’ll analyze their possible short position to justify why the squeeze may happen. Again, this is all conjecture and thinking out a possible trading strategy

In this case study, a high short interest stock is defined as one in which the short interest is greater than 50%. The reason why we will focus on these stock is because of the difficult of buy back all the shares before the market discovers how these shares are valuable because you have to buy them back at any price to meet contractual obligations.

Going forward, everything I write is based on conjecture but backed up by evidence. Shorting is a opaque dark art and it’s hard to get concrete data. But it shouldn’t block us in this whiteboarding session.

Here is a Melvin Capital possible short interest based on their sec filing of put positions \[2\]

1. Gamestop (GME)
2. AMC Networks (AMC)
3. Dillards (DDS)
4. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)
5. The Macerich Company (MAC)
6. Tanger Factory Outlet Center (SKT)

I’ll analyze short interest based on data from ortex.com \[3\]. Ortex data is shown in the imgur links. This data is not confirmed but estimate and such has a possibility for high errors. However, ortex has been very reliable in the past.

**AMC**

[https://imgur.com/a/s48vgAV](https://imgur.com/a/s48vgAV)

% of float shorted 62%

**Dillards (DDS)**

[https://imgur.com/a/DI18mYL](https://imgur.com/a/DI18mYL)

Estimate Short Interest: 58M

% of float shorted: 54%

**MAC**

[https://imgur.com/a/JpXcPrP](https://imgur.com/a/JpXcPrP)

Estimate Short Interest: 71M

Float: 113M

% of float shorted: 63%

**SKT**

[https://imgur.com/a/mcyDYuE](https://imgur.com/a/mcyDYuE)

Estimate Short Interest: 48M

Float: 90M

% of float shorted: 53%

As you can see all these positions are heavily shorted, and should this hedge fund need to acquire shares of them on the market because of liquidation, it may have trouble to close out its short position. Hence, a very high likelihood of a short squeeze.

# Short Ladder Attack

A common maneuver Hedge fund deploy to vacuum up shares is a short ladder attack \[1\]. They do this to drop the price and scoop up shares. For hedge funds with big short positions this is effective because it makes it seem like the shares aren’t valuable when they are.

Usually, they will borrow 1-3% of shares and short, causing people to panic sell. If they do this repeatedly after like 10 days, they can close out 30% of their short position before the market notices. Do you see now how they can leverage 1% to scoop up 30% of the shares with this attack? It’d be difficult for them to vacuum up all the shares at once without the price increasing or the market knowing, so they manipulate the price lower and do it over a period of time.

That is why you’ll see the days to cover metric. Based on the volume, it suggest how many days they can get away with this before they are whole. However, should people realize that their short interest is too high, they can HOLD and buy more to force hedge funds to buy the shares at a higher price.

But you can see that the volume is increasing, so the market is aware of a potential short squeeze.

# Short Squeeze Precedent

In the week of March 20, 2020, Blue Apron had a short interest of about 50%. And then they experienced a short squeeze which led the price to climb 1000% in a week. So you can see how explosive the share price can climb, should a short squeeze occur, for stocks with a short interest of 50% or greater.

Never trade more than you’re willing to lose. Diamond hands.

That you are willing to part with this money in the name of the greater good. Gamestop has had a profound impact on your lives growing up, and now will have in our worst hours (through the pandemic, and with the help of /u/DeepFuckingValue) have done the same yet again.

1. Due to this easy divide, the hegies ensure the game already has fail-safes they can use to minimize their risk in a situation where they are squeezed. 

1. (here's the fun one) When the tits on their scheme do in fact go up and they get squeezed, they create a single very bad actor to put all the blame on. Robinhood can't be subject to regulatory actions if they are already bankrupt from class action suits. or vice versa. Robinhood was enough of those lowly 'retail' investors that they could use it to manipulate the market with it and then sacrifice that one company and still get off. 



You have to wonder how much of that was always the plan. Was robinhood always nothing more than a setup to take our money and protect them from being squeezed?

2. We congregate in the same place every day (r/wallstreetbets) to worship and to spend time with those who share our beliefs

3. We commit sins (selling) and are forgiven by those who see through our paper hands to the strength within to overcome and rectify our sins (buy the mf dip)

This sharing of information is not illegal or any type of market manipulation, since it is all true to the best of our knowledge at the time the statements were made (the data we can access says the short interest has been over 100% of the float for a long time now). It is not illegal for one investor to inform another investor about truthful (or perceived truthful) information. 

From there, many investors simultaneously made the decision that it was in their best interest financially to buy GME stock in the hopes of triggering a VW like squeeze. 

Example: when this hit mainstream news, a friend called me and said “explain short squeezes like I am five and why GME has the potential to be one”. So I (a semi-experienced investor) did so to the best of my ability, whilst disclosing that I am currently holding GME shares. This individual then made his OWN decision to invest a significant portion of his portfolio hoping to at least double his money. 

We have also spread the information that, the less people sell, the worse position that puts the short sellers of this stock into trouble. From there, people have made their own decisions. Those of us that think enough people will hold to trigger a larger squeeze are holding while some people have sold thinking the squeeze was already over. 

Again, we are not colluding in secret to agree to buy/hold a certain amount of shares together. No one knows how many GME shares we (the retail investors discussing this) collectively own. We are just spreading information about what CAN happen if investors behave in a certain way and people are rationally choosing simultaneously hold/buy from there, which appears like collusion.

Edit: disclaimer that I still hold GameStop shares.

We were on the brink of a Bear Stearns moment. Basically, these funds were so leveraged that many of them were blowing up, and it threatened to take down the entire market with it.

&nbsp;


TLDR; Had the ""FREE MARKET"" remained free this would have caused a massive systemic crash due to forced deleveraging of hedge funds.

&nbsp;

**Understanding Leverage:**

Many people don't quite understand the game that goes on between these big funds and the market. These big hedge funds are leveraged up so say Melvin Capital has 12 Billion in AUM (Assets under management) they are likely leveraged up 5-10x meaning they actually own stock positions worth 60-120 Billion. If enough hedge funds blow up at once, the whole system collapses because they are forced to sell longs and deleverage. This is what happened in 2008, and these guys saw it happening again.

&nbsp;

**The entire market was at systemic risk.**


They had no out so they changed the game. The clearing firms, and Depository Trust Company suddenly changed the entire margin requirements for every ""meme"" stock. Basically when you buy a stock normally your broker has to give a clearing firm 2% of the collateral of the stock price, and the trade is matched with a seller/buyer and sent to a firm like DFT who then records you as the new owner of that share of stock.

&nbsp;


**Changing collateral requirements suddenly**


Well guess what they changed the collateral requirement to 100% yes you are correct they changed it to **100%**. This FORCED many brokers to not allow buys on the stock. This is the true culprit behind whats going on. ***The Citadel*** was at risk of blowing up which means big banks like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs were gonna take heavy losses. This would cause a massive market pullback probably between 15-20%. They COULD NOT let this happen. You think President Biden wants to watch the stock market blow up on his second week in office?

&nbsp;

**A coordinated attack on retail investors:**

I have never ever seen the level of manipulation that existed on Thursday and Friday. These funds are all on the brink of collapse so they cut off access to over 95% of the people from buying, and forced sells or hit stop losses on every single open position. Interactive Brokers HAD been my broker for many years, and I had promoted them for ages. Watching their Chairman Thomas Peterffy say we will stop trading UNTIL these stocks return to a reasonable price angered me to my core. You run a broker firm YOU DO NOT DECIDE THE PRICE OF A STOCK PERIOD. This was a coordinated takedown of the young retail investor who was on the verge of a HUGE win.

&nbsp;


**Where stocks would have ended the week causing a market blowup:**

So what is the real price these meme stocks would have ended up at you ask.

$GME 1000


$BB    50


$AMC  30


$NOK  12

I am not taking it anymore ....... Seriously I am fucking done

Yesterday I started looking over everything I have sold the last 20 years. NVDA at 120 due to the Citron short, AAPL 90 pre split due to all the sell side analysis saying over extended, over priced, and the list just goes on and on. ISRG which was one of my favorites of all time I sold at 18. Now they limit the amount of shares I can buy in a company. I realize this has been talked about non stop on this sub, but I am going to actually start doing something about it.

Starting on Monday I am going to liquidate my 401k and every other stock I have besides GME (500k). I don't care if this market moons or falls apart, but I want change. Change so these giant funds can't manipulate the market the way they want. Change so that the playing field is leveled and I am not going back until this happens. Maybe if enough people really start to pull out we can finally start sending a real message.

In regards to GME I like the stock, and going forward I want to buy more. If I die on this hill then so be it, but it's the last time I get manipulated.  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

In addition I have money going to brokerages that can't restrict what I buy. It will be there on Monday

Edit 1: I am not cashing out my 401k to stick it into GME. I am cashing out and letting it sit in a money market for a while. Same with all my other accounts. No I am not going to withdraw my 401k just let it sit in a money market for a while.

Before, the shady activity of the brokerages was hidden from the general public. They were able to manipulate the markets all they wanted and get away with it because the ""commoners"" didn't care or understand. 

Now, with millions of retain investors that flooded the market, a shift in ""market influence"" in favor of smaller, amateur traders. And the gargantuan, amorphous investment firms didn't like that at all. 

It has become a battle of market influence, and the hedge funds and brokerages with massive amounts of capital are doing WHATEVER IT TAKES (illegal or not) to make sure that they retain that authority that they previously held for so many years. (flooding certain stocks with short positions, disabling certain stocks)

But with investment firms taking blatant illegal action to accomplish their goals, their shady activity has been revealed for the world to see and it seem as of now, that the general public, as well as some democrat lawmakers have taken an interest to them. (It also shows how corrupt the SEC is with them taking their sweet time to decide which side they want to be on)

Hopefully through this incident, the integrity of the US markets can be improved with dishonest brokerages being dissolved.

The problem is that hedge funds are facing unlimited loss, and may be forced to buy at any price us 🦍 ask for.

#HOWEVER


At some point, as has happened to pretty much all short squeezes,


##Gamestop will offer shares to the shorts at some point. 


They already have a 100m dollar offer lined up, but they could easily offer more. Why would they do this? Because it would make them a fuck ton of money. 

At the end of the day, Gamestop is a business. They are in the midst of a huge transition, and the ability to clear debt and have more cash on hand during this time would be life changing money for this company. AMC did it this past week, it happened during the VW squeeze when
Porsche offered stock and made a fortune. Gamestop will likely do the same thing. They'd be absolutely stupid not too. 


What does this mean? Well, it means that your 69420 per share probably isn't going to happen, but I still expect a big ol squeeze is in the works. Just be prepared for this type of announcement, and when the dust settles let's make sure we continue to support the company.

Article from the FT:

The crucial role played by clearing houses in financial markets has been thrust into the spotlight after contentious moves by US brokers such as Robinhood and Charles Schwab to restrict retail investors’ bets on stocks at the heart of the Reddit-fuelled trading boom.

Customers reacted angrily on Thursday as brokers moved to stop them opening new positions in certain red-hot stocks, accusing them of unfair treatment or even a Wall Street establishment plot. But the brokers gave a more mundane explanation: the extra volatility in share prices meant they had to hold more capital at the institutions that clear their trades.

What do clearing houses do?
These unobtrusive venues normally sit in the background of daily market activity but they can become the centre of attention during periods of volatility when they require more cash — or “margin” — from their members to ensure that deals are honoured as customers expect.

An equities trade that has been executed can take up to two days to be legally settled, creating a risk of it failing if either side of the trade defaults. A clearing house stands between the two sides to manage the risk to the market if that happens.

Each day members of the clearing house, which range from small brokers like Robinhood to big Wall Street banks such as JPMorgan and Citigroup, are required to put up margin as insurance for their trades.

The amount is calculated by the clearing house and is based on the amount of trading carried out by each member, as well as the volatility of the individual securities traded. Margin is generally collected at the start of the trading day, although there can be intraday calls in frenzied periods, in an attempt to protect the wider market from sudden trade failures.

The clearing member often has limited time to make up the shortfall and the margin typically has to be an asset that is highly liquid, such as cash, US government bonds or shares. In the middle of the market volatility last March, one US bank was required to find $9.6bn of margin for derivatives trades within an hour.

How do brokers such as Robinhood fit into this?
In common with rivals such as Schwab and ETrade, Robinhood clears its own trades and is a member of the main US equities clearing house, run by DTCC.

While self-clearing saves on the fees that would otherwise go to another clearing broker, it also means Robinhood takes on the risk that an executed trade does not settle, and needs to have more cash on hand to cover shortfalls. It also faces higher costs if the clearing house raises margin requirements in volatile periods to protect against a member default. 

“The extreme volatility is a big factor behind this,” said Andy Nybo, managing director at Burton-Taylor International Consulting. “They need to make sure they are able to meet cash requirements, whether it is for clearing or to investors that are owed money due to trading activity.”

As Robinhood said in a blog post on Thursday, the requirements “can be substantial in the current environment.” It declined to comment further.

Between Wednesday and Thursday, the margin call from DTCC across the US equities market rose from $26bn to $33.5bn, the clearing house confirmed.

DTCC said the frenzied trading in shares such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment “generated substantial risk exposures at firms that clear these trades . . . particularly if the clearing member or its clients are predominantly on one side of the market.”

How did brokers respond?
Safety mechanisms built into the market’s infrastructure across Wall Street led to periodic halts in trading activity on Thursday. In order to ensure they had enough money to cover margin and capital requirements, Robinhood and others such as Schwab and TD Ameritrade raised margin for trading on some of the names at the heart of the volatility, which required more cash be set aside after each trade.

This limited its margin needs from escalating further. By allowing users to close positions, it was still permitting trades that would reduce its immediate need for cash.

Robinhood also raised the margin requirements for customers that had not paid for the total value of their trading up front, having cut its margin requirements in December in an attempt to drive more trading activity. That meant some customers suddenly needed to come up with cash to cover trades.

Behind the scenes, Robinhood moved to raise a fresh $1bn in capital from its existing investors, which it announced ahead of trading on Friday. The company said the fundraising was a “strong sign of confidence from investors that will help us continue to further serve our customers”.

Anthony Denier, chief executive of Webull, another company that was forced to restrict trading in some shares, said in an interview with Yahoo Finance that its clearing firm “simply could not afford” the cost of entering into new trades.

“This has nothing to do with a decision or some sort of closed, cigar smoke filled room of Wall Street firms getting together to the dismay of the retail trader,” he said.

Simpler Explanation from Comments 
————————

RH and other similar execution firms have to post collateral with the DTCC every time a position is opened. This collateral is to protect the DTCC in the event of the market moving against the position between the time of execution and the time the trade settles (T+2) AND the execution firm failing to settle the trade by being unable to come up with the cash (in the case of a purchase) or the shares (in the case of a sale). 

When a share is particularly volatile, the DTCC will up the collateral requirements it imposes on both buyer and seller. When the trade does finally settle the collateral is returned.

RH and other execution firms are prohibited from using client funds for this purpose, which must remain in a segregated account until settlement is finalised. Even if RH decline to allow margin trading on certain volatile stocks, insisting that buyers stump up the full purchase price, this money cannot be used for the 2 day period when RH has to post collateral. If RH executed a sell order during this period, that would reduce DTCC's risk and allow it to return collateral to RH rather than ask for more. This collateral could be re-used by RH, allowing it to make another purchase on behalf of a client. This is why RH could accept sell orders nut not buy orders periodically. Once it had executed enough sell orders, which freed up collateral, it could then offer to accept buy orders, until the collateral ran out again. This is why the blocks on buy orders were periodic - they hit their collateral limit, so stopped accepting buy orders. They executed sell orders which freed up collateral (and collateral was returned as trades settled), allowing them to offer buy orders agin, until the collateral limit was hit again, when they had to once again suspend buy orders. etc etc

And ran out, it did. RH's business model is based on a steady stream of small orders on both the buy sand sell side. If it is executing both buys and sells consistently over time, as far as DTCC is concerned it has very little risk to RH so doesn't need to ask for much collateral to be posted. Hence RH had never planned for a situation where it would be asked to post large quantities of collateral (potentially $billions).

So, it ran out of collateral that it would need to post for buy orders, but sell orders would free up collateral. It arranged a convertible bond issue with existing shareholders that raised $500m immediately, and hopefully another $500m in a few days and it drew down on a loan facility it had with its banks. But still not enough. 

The issue RH (and others experienced) is the ridiculously long time it still takes to settle trades (it could be more or less immediate) and the rules that prevent it using client funds as collateral (if settlement was immediate, the client funds wouldn't remain in the segregated account, but would be used immediately to settle the trade).

But it is what it is. If RH wants to execute trades it has to be able to put up the collateral. If it doesn't have the collateral, it can't execute trades (at least the trades that require collateral). But the wider market remained open. Anyone could buy or sell shares at all times. They just needed to put up the collateral themselves for the 2 day settlement period, or find someone who would do so on their behalf.

If you're already sitting down then stand up, now sit back down. 

First off, *fuck your bitch and the clique you claim*, when I watch a movie I want to see it on a massive 70+ FOOT screen. You think I want to watch a gem like Frozen 2 on small bitch ass 60 inch TV screen with shitty ass TV speakers? No. I WANT THAT FUCKING BASS REVERBERATING THROUGH MY TESTIES AND IT TICKLE MY ANUS. Thats some good shit. I ain't getting this shit at home. My wife doesn't like losers who watch movies on small ass TV screens. That's why she's with her boyfriend right now. 

Secondly, I don't have a fucking fountain soda machine in my house. Im a poor retard who is trying to make a living like Steve Cohen. Nothing is better then sippin' that sweet carbonated nectar with a big fat bin of popcorn or a god damn pretzel. I also don't have an arcade section to kill time. SOME EVEN HAVE BARS. 

Thirdly, this shit is 13$ right now. Severely under valued.    Its not the company's fault that shit stains suppressed this stock for years and prevented further growth. Its not the company's fault that covid fucked its business right in the ass. 

But guess what, we have vaccines now! Covid is far from over but its only a matter of time until our wives respect us by watching 🚀 Man on big ass fucking screens like we 🦍 are supposed to. 

They are embracing streaming like the chads they are:

Chicago is opening up more theaters and as restrictions are lessened more will open up:

They cut into their debt which means NO BANKRUPTCY!

This is a 40$ stock, at the very least and when they're clicking on all cylinders it can go even FURTHER BEYOND. It will take time to get there but this is a no brainer hold!

Position: 1k shares, avg $8.7. 

TLDR: I like this stock. I like watching movies in the theater.

We are entering a new stage of the short squeeze.  It’s apparent by now that it’s not playing out like the VW short squeeze because the setup was so long and out in the open.  Hedge funds had time to collude and plan how they’re going to deal with the fallout.  As we saw last week, they came up with some clever fuckery.

&#x200B;

For a recap, here are some tactics we saw from them:

\-  Short attacks driving the price down, triggering stop loss sells and trading halts.

\-  Spreading the word through the media that they had already closed their short positions

\-  Putting pressure on brokers to limit buying of GME and killing the buy side of the trade, making it easier to drive the price down.

\-  Low volume ladder attacks to drive the price down and forcing out paper hands.

&#x200B;

We held strong, guys and gals.  We closed Friday just a few dollars shy of the highest closing price on Wednesday.  But now the real trench warfare begins.

Melvin told CNBC that they closed out their short positions.  I have a theory that this may not be technically false, with a caveat.  I think it’s very possible that Hedgies have closed out their ORIGINAL short positions, but they’ve been replaced with new short positions.  These guys are not going to lose billions of dollars lying down, so they must have their own end game for how to get out of the trade alive, and perhaps even make a profit.  

If GME was a tasty short target at $15, imagine how irresistible it is at $320.  These fuckers lost their shirts on the original trade, but they see an opportunity to make it back on this new trade by repositioning their old shorts from the $15 to new shorts in the $200-300s.

&#x200B;

How can we know this is likely true?:

\-  The short interest has fluctuated, so we know there has been some covering

\-  The short interest has remained high, somewhere around 100% or above

\-  There have been short attacks in $100s, $200s, and $300s, so we know there are new short positions at those levels.

\-  Hedge funds are cocky assholes and they’ll do anything to turn a losing trade into a winning one, and if it fucks over the little guy to scare them back to submission, all the better.

&#x200B;

So basically, nothing has changed.  This is still a short squeeze play, just with much higher stakes.  We have the advantage however, because it doesn’t cost us anything to hold onto our shares, whereas it’s costing Hedgies billions of dollars to hold out.  We will know we are winning next week if we continue to see more de-grossing in the broader market.  If we can hold out, we can take this to the next leg up, ACT III, and eventually the end game.

To start, this is FUD, but not for any particular stock. This is FUD pertaining to the entire financial system.
Folks, this truly is the endgame. The amount of attention we and GME have received, the amount of eyes glued to what's being played out here and with the market is absolutely mind-blowing. And it happening for a reason





**The complete collapse of financial markets is upon us**




Retail investors, (not wsb, there is no we here) are Frontpoint, they are Scion Capital, they are Brownfield. They aim to benefit from the collapse. 





**Lives will be destroyed, and it's not just the rich that will suffer**




If this squeeze happens, and you find yourself on the profit side of the trade, prepare yourself for actual war. They will attack you, they will attack everything they can. They can freeze accounts, they can shut down this subreddit, they can send people to jail. And you best believe they will.

Don't think you'll have much to worry cause you'll just ride off into the sunset with all of your tendies? Lawyers cost a lot of money. Bank accounts can be frozen. Your money might not even make it to you if your broker goes under.

I keep asking myself...


Why the fuck was $BB limited too, they fucking got caught shorting [before this news](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) which is huge, that's full partnership all the way to market in a car manufacturer huge.

They lost and used $GMEs momentum to halt it and hide, then short ladder attacked it all week (in the literal matching pattern of GME and AMC)

You know how fucking hard that is to stop when they limited a $15(was $27) to 5 shares?

&nbsp;

*By slowing $BB I theorize they may have showed more of their cards than you think*.... *hear me out.*


***Theory:***  They run algos as a hedge ""group"" however many invested in and benefit from the trade data of retail (let's call them dipshits) 

Dipshits found an algo that has been printing free money for years, simple. Every play you see retail doing, wait until I hits certain metrics and short the fuck out of it to collect paychecks. 


Problem being: these moved faster than dipshits algo could ge recognize so it saw more sentiment and went for more shorts.

*and they don't have an off button*

So combine that with the bots spamming social media (that their algos monitor for plays) and dipshits were getting metrics readouts that said free money here. 

So they asked for $2.75 billion more to put on it. 

Dipshits iterally only have one play, to wait until a group gets excited and then short the stock for your money - ***and it's not fucking working*** so they stopped the game to try to turn it off (notice they still bought more short positions this week)

The $BB short position was only 7% shorts, so by their volatility definition it doesn't apply(so again why stop trade).... but it's now 9% shorted *after that news?!?*

***TLDR:***

🤡Bad programming, no one competent enough to fix it. 🤡

But REMEMBER to have the most fun with your money by giving it away and back to the communities that got you to where you could be today. (Small amounts count and mean the world to others when they think their world is crashing).

Everything had to line up in the world sequentially for all of this to happen for you.

I am a firm believer that the more you can make an impact with your money - the more happier and fun your life will become. You don't have to give away thousands or millions regularly. Go to Walmart and pay off a layaway. Pay for the food for the person behind you. Be a good person. Make the difference.

Understand that as fast as you aquired this money, is as fast as it can disappear if you don't put some away. (hence the billionaires panicking).

Also, don't forget to support the businesses you cashed in on. This is pretty much a once in a lifetime to save your country post-pandemic from decline of past lifestyle hobbies.

To the abroad investors, thank you for having the back of the world - in order to hopefully reform the free market and free world for what it should be.

This should show you that the world is not as bad as politics or the news may try to make it out to be. We are hand in hand when it counts.

Dont get propagandized this is the real reason why they are terrified of us.

Hedge funds don't get unlimited money they dont got papa jpow's printer (yet). How do they raise money? By showing good returns and getting investors. So the hedge fund goes out there and tells all the millionaires that hey we can give you 10% returns on these regardless of market conditions and we are the only ones who can do it since we are oh so smart. Then we come along and we flip the script. By now, every single millionaire around the world has heard about GME and what we have done. Melvin was the poster child of hedge fund, their messiah of just how ""smart"" they are and they paraded them to show why hedge funds are the only way to make money. And we are taking them down without barely lifting a finger.

This is what scares them. The rest of the hedge funds dont give a shit about Melvin capital losing billions, less competition for them! But by now they have gotten calls from every one of their investor and realized these guys are just as stupid as my 10 year old why do I need them in the first place? Is all the research and analyst calls and all just for me to buy into this scheme? If enough people pull their investments from them and put it into indices THEY ARE FUCKED. Hedge funds only have power because of their collective bargaining of their investors. Once you chip away that power they are just glorified wsb users. Hedge funds fight other hedge funds every single fucking day and it barely registers on the news anymore but this is a direct attack on their way of doing business and that's why you are seeing  monumental amount of hedge fund apologists coming out to attack us.

TLDR: I am neither your dad (maybe) nor you financial advisor. Hedge funds are scared because we are attacking their bottom line. All I want to see is Melvin capital go bankrupt and this scam exposed for the world to see.

[Charts in question](https://ibb.co/album/TrQtGN).

Thousands of $GME enthusiasts from all around the globe bought shares of the company they like. I always thought this was the core principal of a free market - you like some company (for any reason you can name), you buy it's shares, this company gets additional capital to finance it's development/operations/research/etc which results in the consumer receiving better goods/services provided by given company, this company appreciates in value, you as an investor profit off of it, everyone's happy.

But there's always someone on the other side of every bet, remember? It seems like that **someone** is quite unhappy with the **commons** taking away their tendies and beating them fair and square at their own game. Probably you have seen media *talking heads advocating for ultra wealthy and blaming it all on the retail trader* (which is absurd by any definition, but they simply don't care - they're doing their job which they are payed for).

You've also probably heard their thesis that everything's about to go under and blah blah blah if commons don't surrender. Which is interesting by itself, so will *everything and everyone* indeed go under or just some *financial institutions that are on the losing side of the bet*? Probably the latter.

So here's the question (which is not a financial advice by any means, I'm just exercising my right for freedom of speech and voicing my opinion here): *what will happen to the share prices of those financial institutions that took the losing side of the bet and are bleeding money in billions already*? How will their next quarterlies look like? What if **commons took their capital away from these institutions by shorting enemy stock and channeled it to the company they liked and believed in**?

**TL;DR**: *the opponent on the other side of the $GME bet is losing and is heavily exposed to the market at the moment, is in great need of capital influx to cover his losing positions, which itself opens up an opportunity to short him and make money on a side bet.*

As you can see, GME is in consolidation a very well defined Bull Flag which by these technicals should be breaking out of sometime this next week.  If we apply Eliot Curve thesis to this, we are currently in the B wave of the A-B-C pattern.  The way these typically play out is by applying the A wave to the end of the B wave, which should give us an idea of how big the next move will be (the C wave).  By these technicals, I'm showing the next move up should put GME around $650-$700.

**Disclosure:**

**Long:**

**334010** [LEHJQ](https://www.quantumonline.com/search.cfm?tickersymbol=LEHJQ&sopt=symbol) **(not trading, suspended and in escrow since 3/2012)**

What about the biggest [naked short of them all Lehman brothers](https://bit.ly/3cjEBP2)? 

[Lehman CTs are still trading](https://yhoo.it/2NAQhCI.), and shorts may not have covered. 

On 1/26/2021 there was a 2X increase in 3 month average volume across all CTs with rise in price.  

On 1/27/2021 there was a 4X increase in 3 month avg volume across all CTs. 

Some news may be coming up or someone knows something.

# [Goldman Sach is still considering these bankrupt shorted Lehman shares as collateral and is not returning the funds of shorters who did not cover the shorted Lehman Shares.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-14/in-this-never-ending-lehman-short-170-000-is-still-on-the-table) 

# From the above article, $170000 of shorter funds is still blocked for 68013 shares, giving the bankrupt shorted Lehman shares a value of almost $2.5/share.

Lehman may reemerge from Bankruptcy this year with 50 billion dollars in net operating losses (NOLS) that can be purchased by big boys to set off their potential profits. 

Also Lehman CTs pay a 6% dividend (on a face value of $25/share equivalent to at least $1.5 share/dividend) as per prospectus agreements which has been suspended due to bankruptcy proceedings

The clue that Lehman may reemerge from the ashes are:

· The preservation of the NOL of $50 billion

· The 24.1B cash back 

· And the most recent clue is when they announce the dividend and ongoing business in UK.

Lehman Brothers may soon rise from its ashes in 2021. 

In 2008 it was estimated to recover only 36 Billion, and as of date it has [recovered more than $100 billion to its creditors.](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2019/01/creditor-recovery-in-lehmans-bankruptcy.html)

It holds net operating losses NOL of $ 50 billion and potential NOLS of $150 billion that make it a prime acquisition target when it reemerges.

# The best part of these NOLS is that according to IRS rules, existing Lehman shareholders must be majority owners of the company when they reemerge for them to continue to retain the tax benefits of the NOLS.

The potential $150 billion in NOLS can be written against their potential profits off by companies that acquire these NOLS upto 2028 . Only the big boys will be interested in such a large amount of NOLs and these NOLS could be worth billions of dollars.

This could finally be our jackpot after waiting for 12 years. Most of Lehman shares are in one big share OBS (escrow) and dont trade. Only the [four CTs trade](https://yhoo.it/2NAQhCI.).

As they are ‘on order’ they cannot be lent out by your broker and in turn you are reducing the amount of ‘free shares’ out there that can be used for shorting purposes. And don’t forget to move your limit order up when the price starts to recover, then, that way your shares can’t be shorted.

""your brokerage firm cannot lend out your stocks without your permission. However, you may have signed a customer agreement that explicitly allows your broker to lend out your securities. This clause is often tucked deep within the customer agreement, and few investors pay much attention to it. ""

I personally see this as being wrong because the brokers are the one's using our shares profiting off of us because we apparently agreed to it in the fine print of a 500 page agreement.

I've used the example of when NFLX shipped DVDs in the mail [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4cvmt/why_im_long_gme/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to illustrate my view that people who have majored in Finance/Accounting are going to value a company by what it's traditionally done, and not by what it *could* do.

But as I watch the hundreds and hundreds of posts about $GME now I worry that **Reddit Retail** is now falling into the trap of lacking imagination.

So, think of the Spongebob ""Imagination!"" meme for a second and then follow along with me: if I were at a Short Hedge Fund that was still Short $GME I would flatten my position next week by completely bypassing the Stock Market.

The Institutional and Fund Holding rates of $GME is over 70%, which means that only around 20% of the float is free to trade when you discount Insiders. So since Short Hedge Funds need shares to unwind, the two places they can go are the stock market and Dark Pools.

Now if you don't know what Dark Pools are, you might want to pause and rethink sinking your entire life savings into meme stocks. Dark Pools are private exchanges set up for Funds to move massive amounts of stock invisibly and without causing volatility. A Fund Long $GME simply offers up a block of stock and Short Funds can bid on it. I suppose you can think of it as a private auction house for Billionaires.

Interestingly, because of all the attention **Reddit Retail** currently has, it's actually possible that Funds currently Long $GME will NOT be willing to bail out the Shorts via Dark Pools, because one anonymous whistleblower could cause a massive PR headache for the Long Fund. Funds that shorted $GME are currently being vilified (I personally see Shorts as being an important part of the financial ecosystem) and I'm not sure any Longs would want to be known as having bailed them out.

Ok so I just woke up and was doing my normal browsing here and I came across this article about the T+2 rule. 

What is that? 
Well thats when you make a trade, it takes 2 days after that for the funds to settle. Some brokers have a T+1 rule

Because of this, Robin the hood had to limit the amount of shares being sold because of increased Margin requirements up to 100%. 

Now if I havent lost you I have easily already lost my original thought but heres my point.

WHY DO FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS TAKE SO LONG? 

If we buy the stock with the money in our account thats legit there and ours, why isnt the full transaction from both ends cleared up in 1 day or hours?

* Nervous paperhands; **GME IS A GLOBAL PHENOMENON**. Relax, look at the price action so far; there will be fluctuations with the hedgies trading shares between each other, but holy fuck **the price will always recover**. The next time a short folds, I'm expected a full-blown domino effect of panicked shorts exiting their positions. You **do not want to miss it**.
* Shorts have **lied about exiting positions**. Repeatedly. Public declarations of closing a short position? Price action to back it up? **Nope.**
* They may have lightened *some* of the more extreme shorts (GME AT 1 DOLLA etc), but their arrogance left them exposed. Why close at such a massive loss when they're *so smart* afterall, surely a bit of public manipulation, block trading on a few platforms, and the price will crash hard? **Denied** 💎🙌
* When trading platforms stopped/limited purchases of GME? Couldn't they have exited then? Sure! They could have exited some positions at optimal timing. But lets look at the short %; They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up (credit to the Bot Spam ;P)
* Volume of Puts that expired on Friday is astronomical, more in the coming weeks. What does this mean? More pain for those bearish hedge lads.
* Fintel is saying a big fat on Shares Available to Short ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)), this is as of 28th.
* Given the lack of MASSIVE bursts on Friday, and somewhat sideways trading, we can assume minimal shorts exited then. They wanted to control the price, and finish below 320 (huge Call volume there). They failed. And why? Because GME is a global phenomenon, retail investors, and sympathetic whales moving in for the kill.

And finally, look at that glorious **STRONG BUY** rating 💎🙌 Hold those shares fellow retards; for those of you not yet in the game, it's never too late. I've seen some nervy posts, be wary of disinformation tactics and paper hands (check user profiles and account age).

Up to this point, I think it should be clear that HF are closing their longs in order to cover the shorts.

This means a decrease in stock price for other institutions aswell. Those institutions need to hedge that risk, but are restricted from buying puts. The only way for them to hedge is by buying stocks with a high short ratio, especially GME. Some of you might have noticed that GME is running the whole highly shorted market by now. Well thats your reason. 

Therefore the argument that retail will run out of money or Robinhood will stop the GME run is not true. **What we are witnessing right now is the downfall of the Long/Short Portfolio**. Those shills at CNBC just don´t understand *why* GME is going up. It´s not a bubble and it´s not a mania. 

I saw some posts about buying puts on SPY. First of all, that's pretty gay. Second, those smooth-brains don´t understand that **GME is the hedge against a possible downturn**.

Back in December 2019 when I downloaded RH, I joined this band of retards called WSB and lurked.  Then in March when one of you suggested a call on an oil company, it was either FANG or SLB, I bought it, RH crashed, canceled it, the stock soared on better than expected earnings that week and I lost gain porn. That was the end of the road with me and RH.   I already had my IRA, my company’s 401k, two 529’s, and my wife’s rollover IRA (with her boyfriend as the beneficiary) with Fidelity. So I transferred my entire portfolio over to them (to avoid paying Uncle Sam tendies).  I highly suggest NOT transferring your portfolio until post-squeeze. Open a new brokerage account with Fidelity, fund it, and start trading ASAP. 

Why Fidelity?  I have had no issues trading anything. I trade OTC’s, FOREX, secondary markets, after-hours, etc...  I’m enabled for L3 options as well. 

Their customer service is outstanding. They also have fee-free index funds which are excellent for your wife’s boyfriend’s kids to learn trading.

Dear WallStreet and CNBC,

You have been calling this a speculative bubble, that GameStop will ultimately crash down to earth, and that the “little guys” are going to get hurt. Jim Cramer wants us to “take your home run” and sell. You use words like “fundamentals” and “valuations” and says that the stock price is not justified. 

Here’s the fundamental:
I am an ER doctor that trained in inner city Detroit. When I was a resident physician, Obama was president. During his presidency, the quality of life of the predominantly African-Americans in the city did not improve. Despite Obamacare, I saw little improvement in the health outcomes of the patients I worked with. I saw continued proliferation of illicit drugs, overdoses, and gang violence. YOU have left these people behind.

I spent the last several years working in a small town in the Midwest, when Trump was president. During his presidency, the quality of life of the predominantly white Americans also did not improve, and have in fact worsened. I saw continued proliferation of illicit drugs, overdoses, and suicides. These patients I care for are also people whom YOU have left behind. 

With the pandemic, I have seen those who are already at the brink of financial solvency lose their jobs and I see lines outside food banks. I see the health outcomes of my patients decline as they forego preventive care. I, on the other hand, kept my job, got a raise, and saw the value of my 401k rise as the economy crashed around me. Going to work every day is a constant and stark reminder of the brokenness and disparity of the economic system and my sheer powerlessness to change it. I realize now that it is not political. It is YOU.

I own GameStop because represents something to me. It is the very embodiment of the millennial generation that you have left behind- a down-and-out aging retailer that you feel is no longer worth investing in. We ARE GameStop. We are not selling because we believe in ourselves and investing in ourselves. We WANT to see it succeed.

I am fully aware that I have benefited from having a 401k and it is what is supporting your industry. But this also means that YOU work for ME. I fully expect you to fuck over my generation to save yourselves by running to the politicians and regulators that you have bought to stop the squeeze and get them to suspend trading on $GME. It is not lost on us that the former Fed chair Ben Bernanke is a senior advisor at Citadel and that you paid Janet Yellen $800,000 in speaking fees. You will tell them that this is a “systemic risk” and that this will “crash the entire financial system”. You will remind them what happened after they let Lehman Brothers fail in 2008. Don’t.

If you are a politician or a regulator reading this, don’t listen to their bullshit. If you intervene, stop trading of $GME, bail out hedge funds and big banks like you have in the past and try to placate us by dragging a few hedge fund managers in front of a congressional hearing, you’ll unite the entire country against YOU. Make sure you are on the right side of this. You work for US too.
 
This country is broken and fractured. You have goaded us into tearing each other apart for years. This is the first time that I have seen the entire country rally behind a single cause. You have given us a reason to unite- against you and the system you have built and upheld. 

I own GameStop not because Diamond Hands. I own GameStop because I AM GameStop. I am choosing to invest in my generation, and selling would be selling myself out."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185631.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['CNBC', 'I', 'ER', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'YOU', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'YOU', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'YOU', 'I', 'ARE', 'WANT', 'I', 'I', 'YOU', 'ME', 'I', '$GME', '$GME', 'YOU', 'US', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'AM', 'I']|['GME', 'GME']

WE ARE CHANGING THE WORLD 🌎 


From the last few paragraphs of her January 29th report https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/january-29-2021



“The Democrats’ hand has likely been strengthened this week by the media frenzy over the so-called “GameStop short squeeze,” in which hedge fund managers got squeezed by ordinary investors driving up the price of the stock of a video game retailer so that the hedge funds could not cover short sales. Investment firms promptly cried foul, only to be greeted with derision, since it is not at all clear that their own stock purchases have a better effect on the markets than those of the smaller investors, and since they made huge money betting on the Covid-19 crisis. Observers see the short squeeze as a populist attack on unscrupulous Wall Street types.

While the entire story behind the short squeeze is not yet clear, it does already have a political meaning. The GameStop story reinforced the growing sense that the system has been rigged for the wealthy. People from across the political spectrum are demanding more thorough regulation of the stock market, a dramatic cultural change.”"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185643.csv|StockTicker|['GME', 'COVID']|['GME']|['GME', 'WE', 'ARE', 'NGING', 'THE', 'WORLD']|['GME']

Who would've thought that my joke YOLO of $5k would turn into $200k and I'd be worried about my money?


And before anyone calls me a shill: fuck those guys. If they're not colluding with hedge funds, they look shady as shit. Restricting stock, changing their policies to force sales of options BEFORE the 3:00pm EST cutoff time, and selling at the absolute worst time possible? Yeah they're gonna face some serious repercussions. The SEC, FINRA, NYSE, DOJ, FBI, Congress...they're all gonna look into what these guys did. If they find a shred of evidence of wrongdoing against old Vlad there, the dude is going to federal prison. Mark my words: he will absolutely be the fall guy. And forget about their IPO. That company is done. Fuck 'em.


I've already filed complaints with the SEC, FINRA, and NYSE, and I encourage everyone to do the same. Restricting stock trading was probably their biggest mistake, and I hope they go down for it.


Ok now that that's out of the way, here's what I think is going on over there:


Half of all Robinhood users own GME stock. That's a fucking absurd number. And we're buying the shit out of it at volumes no one has ever seen before. On top of that, we managed to get Robinhood's app to #1 in the App store. Not for investing or finance, but for EVERYTHING. That's an internet hug of death that would've overwhelmed anyone.


And everyone who downloaded it bought GME.


On top of that, despite our motto of buy and **HOLD**, there are some guys who are swing trading this shit every time it spikes and tanks. Stupid and I hope we leave them in the dust, but it's happening.


So let's say, on an average day, Robinhood does 10 million trades (no idea, making it up). On Wednesday, they did 100 million trades (example) and freaked the fuck out. When we buy/sell a stock, it looks like it's instant, but some stuff goes on behind the scenes that we'll never see. Basically, at the end of the day, all of the brokers come to the bar and settle up their tabs. And they can't use our money to do it for...reasons. So they have to have the $ available to pay their bills. These are the clearing houses you may have heard about.


And we just absolutely overwhelmed them. They were prepared for maybe up to 100 million trades overall, but not 100 million on a single stock. And not when we're also buying the shit out of AMC, BB, BBBY, and others. So what did they do? They panicked.


They restricted buying of those stocks in order to be able to pay their tabs on Thursday and Friday. They also went out and raised $1 billion from investors (good move). But what they DIDN'T do was explain wtf was going on to investors. They simply said this was for our protection and due to volatility.


This is...actually true. Sort of. They have to pay their tab. If they can't do it, we can't buy/sell at all and they could go under. And this is all because of what we're doing, which is creating massive volatility. They actually ran into a similar problem back in March last year when they raised $200 million because, again, we bought the shit out of stuff.


The CEO should have come out and said, ""Look, we're having liquidity issues that have nothing to do with bankruptcy. We're very profitable (they are), you're just buying too much, too fast, and we weren't prepared for it. So it was either this or we go under. We chose this.""


Except what would your average Redditor hear?


**OMG THEY'RE BANKRUPT!!** That would cause mass panic. We'd actually probably fuck this whole thing up. Everyone would sell their GME shares and try to rush out of Robinhood, the GME stock would tank, short sellers would win, and we'd lose the game.


And this wasn't just Robinhood. E-Trade, Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, and Webull all had the same issues. Webull wasn't as shitty about it and the CEO came out and explained, and then allowed trading again.


Over the weekend, Robinhood should come out and tell the people what's going on in a VERY calm way. Then go to Chase and secure a $10 billion line of credit for the short squeeze and tell us you're doing it. Stop restricting trading. Apologize profusely and send us all $40 DoorDash gift cards.


If you have $ with Robinhood and it's not tied up in GME, do as others have suggested and switch to Fidelity, Vanguard, Chase, etc. If you're stuck, you're stuck. If the absolute worst case scenario happens and Robinhood somehow ends up bankrupt, we have SIPC protection (like FDIC) up to $500,000. And the federal government will step in and liquidate them and try to get you your $ back as well. In almost every single instance of a broker failing, people were able to get almost all of their money back. So don't worry about that TOO much.


In the end, yes, Robinhood deserves a shit ton of blame for all of this and I hope they go bankrupt when they IPO. I think it's extremely suspicious that they have a relationship with the guys we're up against, and their actions don't look good at all. I hope we just overwhelmed them, and the coming week will probably give us more insight into whether they're innocent or guilty.


So again: fuck Robinhood for what they did. They can try to turn things around and be more transparent so we can at least trade this week. It benefits all of us to hope they succeed, because that's where most of the GME buying is happening.


**EDIT**: So why not transfer my money or shares elsewhere? Because it takes too long and we have no idea when this thing is gonna go nuclear. If I felt like I had time, believe me, these shares would be on their way to Fidelity right now. But if we hit $1,000 or $10,000/share in the next few days and my shares are locked, I won't be able to sell. They'd probably clear right around the time this thing came back down to earth.

**MOST TICKERS BEING SPAMMED ARE NOT PRIMED TO SQUEEZE**

Get one thing straight idiots...GME is truly a unicorn right now. It was bet to basically go into the ground. I hope it keeps rising but let’s be real, the restriction on share count and removal of fractional shares on RH could slow this down. 

But.

These other tickers that are being harpooned into space are not without cause. Why are they being harpooned?

Because we LIKE these companies.

Because these companies have been beaten down during COVID or the current tech onslaught.

And...because they are not OVERVALUED.

Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix, etc. are at or near ALL TIME HIGHS. Their ongoing innovation is by buying up companies like GME to put under their umbrella.

We're ""advised"" not to buy at the peak but when we switch to tickers that are on the bottom floor...we're told not to do that too?

Fuck that. And Fuck Wall Street.

#TL;DR (even though I literally have single word lines you lazy fucks)

Robinhood's baby gloves ticker list are the next wave because they're all severely undervalued. Wall St wants to continue to inflate big tech to screw us when they ride the wave back down.

I believe that is partly due to misinformation about the ease of switching so please read if this applies to you.**

Let me start by saying the following: People can sell when they want, buy when they want, and I have no agenda here regarding that.  I also don't work for any other platform and I really don't care which one you move to, if you move at all.  I have read dozens of posts from Robinhood users (I am not a user of their platform) that range from mild displeasure to full-on outrage.  I have read far fewer posts, however, about people actually initiating the process of moving to a better online brokerage option.  There are several but first let's cover some basics so that you are fully informed on how easy it is.  If you had started the process of moving on Thursday when you should have you'd probably be ready by Tuesday/Wednesday of this week so don't delay any further!

**I Read Three Main Concerns, Each I will Briefly Address:**

1. Users think they have to sell their holdings first.  THAT IS FALSE.
2. Users think they can only use one platform.  THAT IS FALSE.
3. Users think the process is difficult or other brokerages cost money.  THAT IS FALSE.

**You Do NOT Have To Sell Anything:** Online brokerages gain and lose clients all the time and anything a transfer occurs it is VERY simple.  I'm finding this aspect of the posts so confusing because it's just as easy to open a new account online at any of the ""Big Boy"" brokerages as it is with Robinhood.  You simply go online, answer questions, and generally your account is open right away!  Next you'll need to fund the new account which you can do in several ways or a combo of a few.  You can link the new account to a checking/savings account you have with a bank, you can transfer assets (UNSOLD) from an old account your new one, and usually one or two other options.  The term for transferring holdings from one brokerage to another is **""In Kind Transfer""**.  Essentially, if you own shares in many stocks or shares in just one stock the old brokerage simply transfers them to the new one.

It would be good to have the routing and account number handy from any account you wish to bring money from too.  If you don't know this simply call your bank first thing Monday morning and ask.  Or go to a branch.  Or go look at the bottom of a check you have and find them there (Google which number is which so you get it right).

**You Can Have Multiple Accounts With Different Brokerages:**  An easier option may simply be to open a new account over the weekend with a different brokerage, get the funds transfer started ASAP, and as soon as the money is there then you can start buying whatever you want from your new account.  You can own *X number* of shares of a company in Robinhood and *Y number* of shares in that same company with a different brokerage.  This is generally what I find my peers to be doing (I'm considered of boomer age by the WSB population) and there are actually a number of reasons to do this.  I think in light of events from this week that point should be self-evident.

**This Process Could Not Be Easier, And Ironically Robinhood (& Others) Applied Pressure Years Ago And Now Most Accounts Have Free Trading:**  That's right, my boomer Vanguard account used to charge a commission for me to buy/sell stock.  Now it is free!  Similarly the commission on options has come down.  Robinhood tricked you into thinking they were doing something different or better.  They actually weren't and certainly now they aren't.

CAVEAT: Vanguard's app sucks.  Some of the other grown-up brokerages apps are better and I've never used Robinhood (but I've seen a million screen shots) and it seems that Robinhood and similar brokerages did design easier platforms, especially mobile-based platforms.  ***HOWEVER, when you've got thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of dollars at stake I'm dumbfounded why a user wouldn't want something LESS basic.***

The transfer may cost you $75 at most (from what I'm reading) but I think the move would be worth it.  But as I wrote above, if you don't want to transfer then just open a new account and keep two open.  One that treats you like shit and tells what you're allowed to do with your money and a new one that appreciates your business and allows you to do whatever you want.  Not sure the choice should be hard here.

**FINALLY, A Note About Margin:** All accounts can have Margin (generally) but that doesn't mean you should use it.  I thought all night about writing this because if you fucks come onto one of my platforms and do a ton of stupid shit and get me banned from being able to buy/sell common stocks I'll be pissed.  But in the effort of giving us, the little guy a chance I felt it better to put this here.  ***Borrowing money to buy stocks is stupid and in the long run you will lose money either from depreciation of account value or interest OR BOTH.***  If you're holding GME on margin right now, for example, you might be best opening a new account and not doing a transfer because you don't want your new brokerage to restrict your trading because you seem high risk.  Obviously some of the bigger, better brokerages may start making their new account process harder anyway if they see an influx of what they deem to be risky investors coming over but I'd suggest you be first in line before that happens if you want to be up and trading THIS WEEK.

I have buried this part at the bottom because I wanted the message to be heard before any of my own thoughts were placed in here.  \*\*I personally am finding it a bit on the nose that so many people are claiming that they're going to ""\*\****hold until Valhalla!""*** **and yet they aren't willing to freeze their trading ability for a 4-5 business day process for a transfer to happen.**  That is suspect AF to me but that's just me.

If people want recommendations of brokerages to consider new accounts with I offer some ideas:

* Vanguard
* TRowe Price
* Merrill Edge (especially if you bank with Bank of America this is going to be your best bet because money should transfer instantly)
* Fidelity
* TDAmeritrade/Charles Schwab (though I may have read they're restricting buying so check that first)

To my knowledge all of these platforms allow you to sign up for a new account instantly online, or very close to it.  If you do nothing over the weekend and nothing first thing Monday morning to correct this Robinhood situation that it seems many of you are in (and believe me, I feel we're brothers in this and therefore I'm trying to help) then I will remain baffled and I'll be sad to see you guys continue to be squeezed.  I have been able to buy dips this past week that you guys weren't and that sucks.  Good luck gents, you no longer have any reason to be dicked around by Robinhood and I suggest you get on this ASAP because this week could get worse.

It is already clear from this week that hedge funds will not go down without a fight, and why should we have expected any less. There is FUD, market manipulation, smear campaigns against us, and paid bots and shilling diversions, just more ways to get your small peasant brain to chase after the next shiny object like the plebian shit-class untouchable you are to them. So what is there to consider?

**The Fundamentals remain unchanged**

Short float is still sitting at 120% and new shorts waiting to profit off of the end drop of the squeeze are coming on board every day. THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF NEW SHORTS. This is great news in one way. The short squeeze still has the potential to blow up. You still have the potential to make fat TENDIES.

1. **DFV is still in💎 🙌**
2. **Both sides are still in💎 🙌**
3. **IM STILL MOTHERFUCKING IN**.**💎 🙌**

**Hedge funds are just as retarded as us**

Are you seriously going to believe that the people running the markets are not just as fucking stupid and arrogant. They have been winning for decades. They think we are marks and have no problem doubling their position in spite of us. They will make fatal flaws that will eventually pay off in the form of a short squeeze once they cant bear the interest.

SO HOW CAN WE GET SCREWED?

There are a number of unprecedented ways this whole scenario can go fucking sideways that you should always be aware of.

1. **We are no longer Us vs Citadel - THE SEC HALTS TRADING ON GME FOR A WEEK OR MONTH**

The world is watching, politicians are watching, other hedge funds, and retards all over the globe. Most important the SEC and the US government is watching. This has almost become a social movement, and the MOMENT it shifts from a good deal and fundamentals in the market to a social movement to fuck over the market and hedge funds the SEC will step in to protect the market.

This is because of our own weight, people joining on because they see the hype against hedge funds and not understanding the market principles behind why a short squeeze will happen.

THERE IS ALREADY PEOPLE CALLING FOR A WEEK OR MONTH LONG HALT TO PROTECT THE MARKET FROM A SOCIAL MOVEMENT. THE SEC DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU.

YELLEN TOOK NEARLY A MILLION IN SPEAKING FEES FROM CITADEL. SHE IS NOT ON YOUR SIDE. She cant overtly help citadel because that would be collusion but she has enough dick swing to make a freeze on both sides that would cool the momentum off on our side, and give the other side enough time to increase their covers.

2. **The players have changed**

Nobody has to disclose what short percentage they are holding. There are so many new shorts that we don't know if it is still Melvin, Citadel, or a completely new set of players at a much higher short position. I highly doubt the original players are still holding their worst short positions and if they have dropped those and put themselves in a much higher short level, the price in which we need to bring GME will increase drastically in order for them to feel the pressure.

Citadel is a FUCKING PRO, they are very fucking likely on both sides of this trade. If you don't believe they are already holding long positions, dumping their most dangerous short positions, and intending to make money UP the squeeze and DOWN the squeeze you are deluded to how hedge funds work. The smartest players play both sides.

3. **The government steps in and bails out the shorts**

This is not going to be a 2008 scenario where you all get a fat payday from daddy USA riding in a white fucking unicorn. There are people all over the world long GME and the gov would never just hand you a payout at whatever price you want. It will look like back door incentives to reduce their position. It will be behind closed doors and the percentage of the profit you will see from this will be low as fuck.

4. **Gamestop itself is forced to dilute its shares**

This is the absolutely worst-case scenario, with one fell swoop the short % would shrink below 100, the risk of a squeeze would deflate, the price would get diluted, and cause a run on GME and its collapse. This would save hedge funds and wipe everyone long GME out.

They cant do this? Don't fucking delude yourself, the government can and will strong-arm Gamestop to do whatever the fuck it feels is best to diffuse the situation if it feels like this will have an impact on the overall market.

&#x200B;

Get your fucking shit together and play the same game they are playing.

**Want to stop the SEC from fucking you?** Write letters to the SEC, Write letters to your congressmen, the governer, Joe fucking biden himself.

**Want to stick it to Melvin capital and hedge funds?** Go protest outside Zuccotti park and have the same nothing effect as the OCCUPY movement had. This GME play is SOLELY because WE LIKE THE STOCK AND THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE GOOD. WE ARE NOT A SOCIAL MOVEMENT and if thats why you are here you are fucking stupider than Melvin himself.

**Want to mentally prepare yourself for the worst? - If you're a little bitchmade paper handed pussy who will cry when you get margin called or bankrupted then reduce your fucking position asap. The people YOLOing millies here are either LOSS VETERANS or doing their DD. ACCEPT YOU MAY LOSE IT ALL AND REMEMBER THIS IS FUCKING AMERICA WE ARE TALKING ABOUT.**

Ps. I am not a financial advisor or american, but Gamestop is and this whole thing can go sideways in ways you may have not thought of.

It took 10 minutes and a couple hours to transfer money. 

Strap in you 💎 🖐 studs, we’re about to leave the solar system 🚀🚀🚀

This was always a good play. The logic and reasoning was there. A large number of shorts were in play and so long as people hold, there is money to be made. 

This requires 2 things. 
* That the retail investor buys and holds
* That the market doesn’t cheat

The first one is tough. If people start 🧻 🖐‘ing this bitch, it’s not going to work and Wall Street wins. You have to rely on a bunch of random strangers to make the same play as you, and that implies inherent risk. 

But you mother fucking autists did it! You held through everything they’ve thrown at us! I’ve never been more proud to be a retard. 

So one out of the two we’re set for, if Reddit held through that dip, they will hold through everything. If DFV can hold, I can hold. 

Which leads to the second point. Wall Street cheating. The thought is(was) that as long as this is fair, we 100% make money as long as point one holds true. The bad news is that it isn’t fair and the market always cheats, so again risky. 

Except we knew those corporate shills were going to cheat, did cheat and you fucking autists still held! You’ve proved your valor time and time again. 

Which is the wrap up. Wall Street cheated and still is losing! We know for a fact point one holds true, and because of Wall Streets cheating it will be even harder now that every eye is on them. 

This literally can’t go tits up positions all in $GME 🚀 🌙 


Bonus point*

#(The argument for why no one gets left behind.)

The first thing to say is that even after a squeeze happens keep holding. 

The reason for this is as follows. 

Firstly, Thursday the shorts position went from 140% to 250% (this is debated. Numbers came from a dd post Thursday. Though I do remember seeing total shorts go up). This means they think they can win and doubled down. So there is a lot more at play. 

But here’s why the HF will always lose if we hold. Think about the stock, it’s doing really well, but is it going to hold long term? Eventually it has to fall, right?

That’s exactly what hedge funds are thinking. They think it’s overvalued and therefore will drop. So their play is to take out more shorts. 

Except this time, the community knows this, so we just keep holding. Eventually the hedge funds can’t keep taking out shorts cause they know we will keep holding and the stock will stay stagnant with Wall Street never being able to win. Sure the price may fall gradually from 10k+, but wall street will never be able to make money cause as soon as they short, we hold.

I sold part of my position as I want to buy a house and that money definitely helps (at the end of the day we want money for these kind of things). I am still holding shares though because I like the stock.

Now that everything is clear, I just want to highlight potential ways Wall Street may use to take away your tendies if you are a GME investor and how you can protect yourself. This is my opinion based on what I observe and nothing else:

#  Potential price supression by hedge funds

Thursday and Friday volume (purple circle) was really low in contrast to previous days (Monday to Wednesday) when the squeeze started (green circle). This means two things:

1. Everybody held the line. Short Squeeze has not even started.
2. What happened on Thursday and Friday seems to be blatant market manipulation to supress the price without the participation of retail investors. Obviously I can not prove this, but volume is the smoking gun. There are also some other posts in wsb that show how short sellers are selling longs to cover shorts (maybe that is why the rest of the market has been red the last two days?)

&#x200B;

[GME hourly chart](https://preview.redd.it/t8cyoo6iuhe61.png?width=1721&format=png&auto=webp&s=f09cfffc3a89f119a34f6988a01410b9c69fa44d)

 

So hedge funds could try to keep the price supressed for weeks or months by restricting retail participation. This is how they ~~ban~~ discourage people from buying and encourage selling.

**HOW YOU CAN PROTECT YOURSELF**: if you want to invest consider buying the stock or if you prefer call options, spread them between different maturities. The worst thing that can happen is that you buy weeklies OTM and they expire worthless, this is how they drain your capital and outlast retail investors. If your broker does not allow you to buy, open an account into another broker.

# Mainstream Media Misinformation

We have seen CNBC manipulating what is happening and trying to spread the narrative that retail investors don't know what to do. They are trying to push the narrative that retail traders don't know what to do and it smells to me like Wall Street is going to ask to shut down forums like this one and limit access to leverage products such as options.

You can find a great interview with Chamath where he literally destroy the CNBC reporter on YouTube (just type ""Chamath GME, AMC"" and you will find it).

**HOW YOU CAN PROTECT YOURSELF**: be careful with posting loss porn from GME options, after Thursday price manipulation where lots of people that bought ATM and OTM options ~~were robbed by hedge funds while retail investors could not participate in the market~~ lost money, they may use these posts on TV and twist them like ""*they lose money because they gamble and they do not know what they are doing therefore it is necessary some regulation in place to limit access to leverage products as they can not take care of themselves*""

# RobinHood or other brokerage services potential bankruptcies

I posted about this yesterday but inmediately deleted the post due to panic it caused (it was not my intention, sorry).

RobinHood funds are covered by FDIC which means your money is safe in the event of bankruptcy, but what I am not so sure (maybe someone can clarify) is, in the event of bankruptcy what would happen to your portfolio.

Aparently RobinHood liquidated some positions for different users without their consent (you can find posts in wsb related to that), so maybe they can liquidate your holdings at market price, give you the money and that's all (this is just pure speculation from mi side). Now, if they do this while retail traders are not allowed to participate, hedge funds could buy your shares at whatever price they want and cover their shorts. Given that Citadel is their main client I would not rule out this possibility.

I know this is too much speculation but could be a potential scenario given what happened on Thursday may have happened because the GME trade caused a systemic risk in the whole US financial markets due to leverage on hedge funds that went short (people have also written other posts about this in wsb).

Under this scenario RobinHood would be sacrified. Short Sellers would cover at the price they moreless want and any potential amount you have on your account not covered by RobinHood would be covered by FDIC (aka the american tax payer... sounds familiar, maybe like 2008 again?)

There is a video on YouTube about this topic in the Meet Kevin channel (seems the guy is quite popular in US).

**HOW YOU PROTECT YOURSELF**: I don't know what you can do in this scenario. Just hold your shares because if you want to transfer them to another broker maybe they also liquidate your positions (not sure about this, if anyone can confirm please, that would be great). Obviously, once GME squeeze is over, get out of RobinHood. If you want to buy GME, you can do it from other brokers.

**TLDR**: If you invested in GME. HOLD. DONT PANIC SELL. NEVER.

Nothing has changed, the short squeeze has not even started.

Be careful with weeklies, this could last weeks or months, better buy the stonk or spread across different maturities.

Get out of RobinHood once the GME short squeeze is over.

The results speak for themselves.

I have not participated in a more meaningful movement in my entire life. It is not The Law, it is Their Law. And in the words of The Prodigy: Fuck 'em, and their law. We followed their rules, then they changed the rules at the last minute to protect themselves.

The system has always been rigged. The only path to change was from within, and we found the key. **Those in power have chosen this as the only solution, it will be their undoing.** They will burn it down themselves, before we do, out of spite for us, to prevent us from taking more than the stale crumbs. We need to take it all away from them before that.

Our next moves are important. We continue the GME squeeze to completion. We proceed to squeeze the other over-shorted stocks. This hunt will be limited from now on in effectiveness now that they are aware and had a market manipulation event in their favor to minimize exposure. Also note the stocks that were gems but heavily shorted so 'tutes could take all the cheap shares for themselves (BB/NOK/PLTR). We now have to contend with their counter-moves. I am anticipating a tree-shake to rout out weak retail so they can lessen our forces. Regulations talks will probably be the catalyst.

We need to think in terms of countering their moves, not following common ""wisdom"". I have a feeling derivatives will be our key here, they offer the leverage and domino effect we can capitalize on. There will be a move away from standard assets as confidence in the old market disintegrates. We will see more crypo and precious metals plays. I am unfamiliar enough with forex/futures to predict their roles, but I welcome ideas.

We have pressed them into playing their entire hand, they will now make desperate moves that we can counter since they cannot afford the time to apply their boomer-scam-tactics as effectively as in the past.

Brothers, frères, hermanos: our victory is afoot. Godspeed and may DFV watch over us.

Short interest in GME has barely changed since this price increase began. That means, either people are holding for their dear lives, or people thinking that GME will go back down as quick as it came up. I'm beginning to think the latter. People see this as an opportunity to earn what they think is free money. If we rise to 400-500, and hold it there, not only will we fuck over a lot of the new shorters, we may end up triggering a short squeeze, as these idiots don't have the same capital or backing that Melvin have, and thus will be forced to buy back the shares in order to avoid going into negative balance. This is just a theory, but it's enough of one for me to hold no matter what the price.|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185643.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['GME', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME']

I had a couple shares back at $20, had paper hands, and sold. I went all in a couple of days ago. Despite it only being a couple of days, I've been lurking here for a bit. The amount of 6 figure, 7 figure, and 8 figure gains I was seeing was blowing my mind. More than that, it was blowing my mind that nobody was selling. I thought, ""you made a 7 figure profit, what more do you want?"" Now that I'm all in, I've been staying more up to date with the things that are happening. And now I get it. I understand why nobody is selling. 

I just saw a video of a billionaire saying it's unfair what's going on. I saw a billionaire say, ""he's just trying to make a living"". I saw an article call WSB an alt-right hate group. I havent seen one billionaire against this movement speak on the recession of 2008. But I have seen stories in WSB of families deteriorating by the days because of the recession. I've seen blatant market manipulation to keep the common man from trading. I've seen countless slanders and whining over the last couple of weeks.

 
You know what else I've seen during this time? I saw a guy on here donate switches to St. Jude. I saw a different guy donate money to St. Jude. I saw a guy pay for his dogs surgery. I saw a dude pay off his student loans. I saw a CEO donate it all to a charity for small businesses. I've seen somebody be able to buy a place after living in their car. 


This is all so much bigger than money. That's cliche as fuck, but God it's true. I'm stuck between my blood boiling and my eyes watering. Honestly, I don't have a huge investment into Gamestop. Its not like my shares alone hold any bearing on Melvin making this out alive or not - but it's all I have. I went from freaking out over losing $100 in a day, to losing thousands in a day and just kinda smirking. 

To be honest, I planned on getting out if it hit $1000. But IM NOT GETTING OUT. Truthfully, I'll survive without this money if it tanks. Obviously money would be nice, but I know some others out there probably need it more. All that I do ask, if you do make it out of this not holding the bag, please do something good with your profits. Please don't turn into the greedy leeches on wall street.

**In this DD I will highlight how the short float % has been increasing over time in BB.**   


[Short float &#37; - Latest data from https:\/\/fintel.io\/ss\/us\/bb ](https://preview.redd.it/sclkg9ivshe61.png?width=2546&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae126d58d0126fd86b28f80ce22eb5f81f4b358f)

As can be seen in this picture, the short float % has been steadily increased over time as the price continues to go up. This could indicate that the shorts have been losing a ton of money, and is now trying to double down. However, this is nowhere near GME or AMC levels but could increase a lot more over time as seen in how much the short volume has increased these last couple of days. 

&#x200B;

[Short volume interest - Latest data from https:\/\/fintel.io\/ss\/us\/bb ](https://preview.redd.it/p7urdnrjuhe61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=99c6f6397db19891afddf34baff974d7269385c9)

As seen in this picture you can clearly see that the short volume has been increasing over time, and will most likely have an effect on how much the short float % currently is. Since the latest data for the short float % is from the 15th of January, we would have to wait for the 9th of February to see newly updated data on the short float %. 

  
The question is now, will they keep shorting BB into oblivion as they did with GME and AMC?   


**It's also important to look at the options flow and the possibility of a gamma squeeze.**  

[Graph from: u\/Strig1 ](https://preview.redd.it/dkcek800whe61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9388763aca6f8fa1109d460f6831034d107242b)

This week we saw something that very well could have been manipulation of the price based upon how many calls that would expire ITM of the price was above $30. They kept the price under $15 to let all these contracts expire OTM. But how does the options table looks like next week? See picture below

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/BB\/options\/](https://preview.redd.it/ra9imjdzwhe61.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3e8fa9c42368fc23590bd56ef2d8875385d137d)

As seen in this picture there are far fewer calls OTM next week compared to this week. So I would think that the stock price has a better chance of moving higher this week. However the possibility of a Gamma squeeze next week is small but if the price can get above $25 there is a chance to see a push upwards due to call sellers buying back shares to cover.

(not really sure how that works). One way to stop this is to put a limit order on it, but that is stupid cause some places like fidelity only allows up to 50% and we don't want to sell it for cheap 500$

What can be done?
Call up your broker and ask them to not lend out any of your shares. 

  ""not allow any lending of any of my stocks or funds.""   They honored that immediately and are mailing a letter stating such. 1-3 business days for delivery. I couldn't be happier with Fidelity.
-u/johnanon2015


What are some of the limits of limit order by other platforms?

TLTR: 💎👐
ONLY limit sell if you are setting at really high price. Like $42,069
Call brokers if you are limited and tell them to not lend it out

This means if the SEC would Step up and rescue Citadel they would fuck over this other 2 that are more powerful then Citadel. The only way out for Citadel is if Blackrock and Vanguard will give them all their shares, but i know they love money too and will not make it possible for citadel.

Why are these posts getting removed?


My position:

737 Shares of GEVO (average price = $8.50)

$GEVO 8/20 15c (5 contracts, average price  = 6.50)


Total Initial Investment

**$6,264 (shares) + $3,250 (options) = $9,514**

This is my largest position and my largest initial investment into any one company. 

**What do they do?**

You guys have positioned yourselves to be in the best position imaginable tocapitalize on a perfect scenario that will explode your customer base and membership moving forward. 

You still have one mountain to climb, however.

YOUR USER INTERFACE IS EMBARRASSINGLY TERRIBLE. I am well aware of the time, effort, energy, and capital you’ve spent building your app and website over the years, and that’s great. However, RobinHood has walked the fucking dog on you when it comes to simplicity, ease of use, and approachability. They’ve brought millions of new investors to the market, and have had world changing successes of which I’m sure you’re all well aware of (you know, like when they changed the game my forcing you to make trades free?).

I’m a Gen X Millennial, and although I may be able to adapt to your convoluted-ass website and mobile app, a lot of the future investors will not have the patience or inclination to do the same. *You have to change it, and do it quickly.* It needs to be sleek, modern, and user-friendly. You don’t have to copy RobinHood (hell, why would you want to?), but you do have to come up with something that can keep the influx of new customers from jumping ship once their aboard, and **I’m not talking about making it hard for us to leave, you have to make it easy for us to stay.**

The last week’s debacle is as best an opportunity as you’ll ever have to catapult yourself into the front of your industry. It’s the World Series, bottom of the 9th, the bases are loaded, and you’re down by 3. RobinHood is pitching with a broken arm, and you are the batter with the .989 average.

For the prices they are selling PUTS and CALLS at the 325 strike price (expiring 5th Feb) upper bound is roughly $575 and the lower $75 ( Purple line) . This is the full straddle price the MM is getting for the options they are selling. Once price goes over this level they start to lose money. 

**They are not expecting price to go above or below these levels otherwise they would have made the options more expensive.**

Usually the MMs try not to hedge as its expensive and is cheaper for them to defend those levels  and /or will rely on the gamma scalpers to start shorting the stock at the call line or the top boundary purple line. Traders who have bought the 325 Calls will have a lot of value in those options and can short the stock risk free if they still have time value left on the option.

However if the MMs think that the levels wont be shorted and there is too much long value in the stock they will buy to hedge themselves.

This however is not a normal market at the moment.

Anyway some levels to watch next week to see if they try defend.

GME to the moon etc etc

Short version: Market is increasingly propped up to cushion the fall / secure the retirement for the elite boomers. No dollars have been printed by the Fed.

This won't apply to most of you, but it probably applies to *some* of you.

Alright morons, listen up. Law student here who has grown fond of wsb through lurking for quite a while. There are some legal issues you need to be aware of if you are, or have been, making moves with GME/the other meme stocks right now. These issues range from civil to criminal, so you should probably read this. I’ll put a TL;DR at the bottom if words are hard for you.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

First of all, I am *not* an attorney (yet), and you should not rely solely on this post to make any decisions at all. **You should talk to a real lawyer** if you think you might need legal advice. More on that below.

I’m going to provide some short summaries of cases along with an excerpt from a relevant legal journal that discuss some of the things I’ve seen on wsb as of late, and if it sounds like you, **go talk to a lawyer.**

* ""The opportunity to violate securities laws on the internet is not limited to issuers. Even common stockholders can opt to violate the securities laws by using the internet to manipulate the markets."" Christine Souhrada, Securities Fraud, Market Manipulation, and the Internet, UCLA J.L. & Tech., 2002, at Notes 28

What that means in tendie-speak is that the SEC can come after *you* for some combination of your posts, comments and trades. This doesn’t mean they *will*, just that they *can.* Note: The SEC has an [Office of Internet Enforcement](http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/internetenforce.htm). Just because this is [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and the memes are good, you're not immune from real-world problems.

The SEC is not the only source of potential problems. They coordinate with lots of federal and state agencies. I’m not going to explain the law & procedure of 50 different state law enforcement apparatuses to you, because i'm fond of you, but not *that* fond. Also, like I mentioned above, you can be civilly liable for behavior that doesn't rise to the level of criminal.

The key to what the SEC calls market manipulation is ""causing enough investors to buy the target company's stock by disseminating **false information** to artificially inflate the stock price. *Id.* (See the above-referenced legal journal, that's what '*Id.'* means) This also applies to artificially deflating (by disseminating false information) if you hold a short position or a put, etc; this is the apparent business model of funds like Melvin, and yes, they should be the ones being looked at, but *should* doesn’t matter and I'm writing this for you, not them.

If you’ve gotten caught up in the hype and memes, and have been disseminating false information in an effort to moon GME, you need to talk to a lawyer **now**. I can’t tell you if what you’ve said is false or not, but a real lawyer can. The lynchpin of liability (tendie-speak: whether you have a problem on your hands) is the making of material misstatements or omissions to induce investors to purchase securities. See §17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, and §10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Here are some examples of people getting in to the crosshairs of the SEC via some of the above-described behavior:

* **S.E.C. v. Simmons**, 8:04-CV-2477-T-17MAP, 2008 WL 7935266 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 25, 2008)

Stock promoter acted with severe recklessness in predicting that a company's stock prices would rise to at least S15.00, yet selling his stock for a third of the price, which satisfied scienter element of the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws. Therefore, promoter engaged in securities fraud. Despite claiming that he posted cautionary warnings to potential investors on his posts on a website and stating that the posts were based on his enthusiasm for the company's future prospects, there was no evidence submitted, besides seller's deposition testimony, that the postings were pre-qualified with a cautionary statement warning potential investors to consider.

* **S.E.C. v. Masri**, 523 F. Supp. 2d 361, 365–66 (S.D.N.Y. 2007)

Defendants purchased 200,000 TZA shares on August 20, 1999, in order to push the price of TZA above $5, thus causing the TZA August 5 put options to expire worthless and avoid the required purchase of 860,000 shares at $5 per share

SDNY Court held that if an investor conducts an open-market transaction with the intent of artificially affecting the price of the security, and not for any legitimate economic reason, it *can*constitute market manipulation.

    “B-b-b-but I only relied on publicly available information!!11!”  

* Yeah, well, so did this guy: **Sec. & Exch. Comm'n v. Fiore**, 416 F. Supp. 3d 306 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) Promoter's reliance on corporation's public filings did **not** allow him to get out of the action filed against him by the SEC.

&#x200B;

    “Nothing I did moved prices, I’m too small!” 

* Still a potential problem. **FindWhat Inv'r Group v. FindWhat.com**, 658 F.3d 1282 (11th Cir. 2011) Finding that confirmatory information that wrongfully prolongs a period during which stock is traded at inflated prices, even without increasing the level of inflation, may be actionable under the securities laws; that is, defendants may be liable for knowingly and intentionally causing a stock price to remain inflated by preventing preexisting inflation from dissipating from the stock price. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, § 10(b), 15 U.S.C.A. § 78j(b)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Lastly, if, after all of this, you find yourself several orders of magnitude richer than you were at the start: **TELL NO ONE. TALK  TO A TRUSTS AND ESTATES ATTORNEY IMMEDIATELY.** I’m sure you’re aware of the issues that lotto winners find themselves dealing with. If you’ve struck gold and are swimming in tendies, you are effectively a lotto winner, which means you are now a target. Even well-meaning people will try to help you spend your tendies. You need to retain counsel to figure out how you’re going to protect yourself from others.

Where the hell was this staunch worship of fundamentals when shorts were borrowing against gamestop to 140% in an effort to push the price down on an equity that quite literally reached a price to book ratio of 0.40? These fucking idiots harp on about fundamentals, but don't have anything to say about a hedge fund exposing itself 10x over to try and push a stock down further than literally less than it's liquidated cash/inventory value.

Similarly, where was this concern for an exit strategy when those same hedge fund shorts were sitting at huge profits? Why didn't they take profits? Where was this concern for an exit strategy when the stock turned a corner and new boardmembers were appointed? Where was the exit strategy when Melvin, Citron, Etc lost 100% of their position, or 200%, or 500%. Where was the exit strategy when they got bailed out for 2 billion and still doubled down on the position? Where was the exit strategy when they quite literally put our equity markets on the verge of a liquidity crisis?

These fucking hypocritical idiots love to throw these things around now that one of the worst trades in history went sideways on them. Where were all these values and disciplines when they made their idiotic trade? Why didn't their prime broker force an exit strategy on them? I sure as shit know my broker would have stepped in a lot sooner. Why didn't theirs? Did their idiotic broker not realize that in a functioning market they are ultimately the last buck and bagholders in this if Melvin becomes insolvent?

Everything about this from their idiotic trade to their response smells like total bullshit.  


EDIT:

PS: I LIKE GME AND AMC AND IM NOT SELLING

My risk tolerance on this position is infinite. Collectively we have extremely diversified and pooled risk across literally millions of people throwing a few hundred or thousand bucks at the thing. The dumb fucks on the other side of this trade have miniscule risk tolerance, massive leverage, and extremely concentrated positions that risk entire hedge funds. No matter how much they try to convince us that we're in a dangerous position, the absolute worst thing that happens to us is we each lose some bullshit money in a diversified loss spread across literally millions of people. All of whom will sleep soundly at night knowing we fought a good fight. The idiots on the other side of this trade stand to lose their oligarchy. They stand to lose entire hedge funds on the behalf of other billionaires who were too lazy to read the prospectus of the hedge fund that just lost tons of their money.

I took Nasdaq data on OI (for the newbies, that's open interest - numbers of contracts out there in the market) for each strike ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain)) and calculated the value at expiration (\[closing price - strike price\] \* 100 shares/contract \* OI = total gain/loss those positions generated). Sorry if you can't do math or read (🚀🚀🚀🚀 APES TOGEHTER STRONNG).

Summary Table:

Current float is like 50.65M ([https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME)) so that means if 9.25M shares get assigned, 18% of float will now change hands as a result.

In the interest of consistency, and because everybody needs to be chipping in right now, here’s the scans that caught my eye today heading into next week. Mondays are my best days so Ill have way more then, EOD.

🐳🧐**Overall, whales kept betting on tech to bounce back heavily**, in convincing style (signals that indicated the call blocks were more than just hedging). Image links are call blocks from each. **Intitial research is often with barchart, but I always check for confirmation with Unusual Whales**

[FB](https://i.imgur.com/A0R2dz2.jpg) 🚀🚀🚀: until the bitter end today, people were feverishly pumping call blocks with puts aligning them. If tech bounces back, FB in particular is due for a rip after correcting post-earnings

[Unusual whales confirmation: look at this March call order](https://i.imgur.com/nQ6WcFN.jpg)

[SQ](https://i.imgur.com/40VDFnM.jpg) 🚀🚀: consistent bullish call volume all week. People thought they fished the bottom yesterday but got curbed by the blood red index day

[Unusual Whales research confirmation: strong 2/5 call block ](https://i.imgur.com/H7onSWz.jpg)

[DKNG](https://i.imgur.com/wapFAGh.jpg) 🚀🚀: lots of sporadic call clusters like this. PENN gets most of the glory, but there are a lot of catalysts coming around state regulations soon. Load up some 2/26 and wait for the pop

[Unusual Whales research confirmation: repeated weeklies each week, such as this. ](https://i.imgur.com/imHvK1O.jpg)

[AMZN](https://i.imgur.com/bfCXbJj.jpg) 🚀🚀🚀: the bulls are buying calls heavily in anticipation of earnings. If you think you know what a good beat is, just wait for AMZN Christmas results

[Ununsual Whales?: yep](https://i.imgur.com/3R6pPLI.jpg)

BONUS: sporadic FDX call orders have come in. After an oversell for FDX recently, AMZN sympathy is plausible based on orders.

[Unusual Whales spotted a sneaky FDX call order for 2/12](https://i.imgur.com/JX0HwyD.jpg)

[INTC](https://i.imgur.com/F2SUHPy.jpg) 🚀 : yes. I know INTC can be awful. But tons of pump since the ER. they have a new CEO everyone is excited about now, and look to have found a bottom. I like this.

[Unusual Whales spotted this INTC call block got 2/5](https://i.imgur.com/aRBlrRY.jpg)

**Tech grab bag:**

**ZNGA PINS CRM SNAP FSLY**
EDIT: I forgot AMD

 **All HEAVY volume and look great for ERs coming off this tech drubbing.** Very bullish call flow.

**EDIT/UPDATE:** /u/lordofoptions has sold me on **SENS**

Hope this gives you some confirmation bias or ideas to look into.

**Inbox always open**: i was super busy this past week, but in light of recent crazy market/WSB events I will be checking frequently and am willing to bounce ideas, field questions.

**TLDR: Buy tech calls, because whales richer than you are doing just that.**

I have never used Plaid before, but apparently that's the how both Sofi and webull integrate your bank accounts for direct transfers these days.

Because I have a RH cash management account, and Plaid has RH listed as one of the bank options, I naturally wanted to transfer money out of RH through Plaid.

Apparently, I couldn't. I double and triple checked username/password. Through both Sofi and Webull, the plaid message goes ""Couldn't connect yo your institution"". Every other bank institution account worked, including Bofa, Chase, and some local credit union/banks. And I haved tried this numerous times over roughly the span of 12 hours.

I'm sorry if it bores you, I saw that story from that dude that posted how his dad lost almost everything during 2008 and I wanted to share my own.


Sorry for my bad English.


Hello WSB, I last post around half a year ago on how the US Stock Market helped me get closer to my dream of being able to support my family with an average country wage of 150USD a month.

I got a ton of encouragement and advices from everyone back then which I immensely appreciated. Now that the GME phenomenon has spreaded over the globe, even here (although we actually cannot help you guys without a lot of trouble like I went through, more below)


So to recap, I saved up 2000 USD ever since I was young uptil now (I'm 21 now), working ever since I was in elementary school, money was all I had in mind ever since our country got hit with the 2008 depression and my family was struggling.


Backstory:


I've always loved PC and paid close attention to it so when their new Ryzen series leaks start getting out in 2016 and I got to test them out while working part time, I took a look at their stock. It was trading at around 2 I think.


So with my excitement I was eager to join the market, I asked my uncle who was a stock investor and his reply was ""The market is rigged, don't join it"". I was stumbed. He lost a lot in 2008, maybe that was why.


So after a month of research, it appears there is no legit way for me to invest in the US market, or actually to any market aside our own. Our banks wouldn't even let us wire money overseas without a reason they deem acceptable. But here's the thing, the hedge funds here can. That was the first unfair thing I witness about limiting the little guy ability to get somewhere in life.


In the end, I couldn't find a way to get in and watched as AMD make it meteoric rise over the past few years. It was really depressing thinking back on how the profit could've helped my family.


Fast forward to 2020, I finally found a way to make a foreign account with TD and have a friend overseas that can help me fund the account, I just need to send him money through epayment. The fees was high, not to mention since we can't use ACH because we're transferring to TD from his account, it cost me somewhere a total of around 50 USD for the money to land in my account.


But after all that I managed to get into the market, I grinded through all the courses on TD and read all the posts from various subs. But life is never that smooth.


Around that time, I saw a post of a member on here using his profit to pay for another fellow member tuition. That inspired me, I wanted to do that so badly, first for my brother.



The Beer Virus Crash:


I joined the market at Feb 28th 2020. Yes, right at the top before we drill straight through earth core because of the beer viruses. I almost lost it all, I switched between puts and calls as I see fit but in the end, I came out with 200USD left. I thought I was the unluckiest guy on earth. It was tiring, since we're on opposite end of the timezone, I usually finish school or work then trare until around 2 or 4am. All that and ending up with huge loss was devastating. Thinking back, I should've pulled out when I was seeing my money losing everyday.


The corona started affecting our country, we did a great job at handling it but I can tell my parents were fearing for their jobs. I put myself back together and get back in with my 200, slowly grinding up back to 2000. It was arduous but when I finally got back to breakeven, it felt amazing. Because I'm not starting again, I'm starting again with experience.


Sadly, by this time, my father lost his job due to corporate politics/dirty-play. I won't get into details but basically there was some bad people doing bad things to try to frame others, it's been going on for years. In the end, he was proven innocent but the corporate still let him go to ""keep the image of the company"". And guess what, he never get a job anymore no matter how many times he gets to those final interviews. We both know that it was because they made him as scapegoat and whenever a new company contact his old one, they would he put off. To them, it's much better to scapegoat one person than to say ""We let a guy sabotaging our employees and company for years without being able to do anything"".


After all the failed job opportunity he decided to give the stock market a try. It was going well. We don't have advance options and we also don't allow ""legal"" shorting here. But as we'll soon find out, it's only a rule for us commoners..


Basically, shorting is not a thing here but hedgefunds or sharks can always call each other and borrow shares to short. I've witness quite a few short ladder attack. 


And since we don't have options, we don't have the ability to buy puts to hedge our account but I am sure the big guy has their ways of getting them


You can tell by this point I have a lot of bottled up contempt for suits.


GME and the global movement:


And that brings us to this unprecedented time. I didn't get into GME soon enough (4 GME shares at 150 cost basis) my money was tired up in Spreade for BB and Nok expiring last Friday which was rather deep ITM (I had BB 21/22C and BB hit a peak of 28 last week). And as we all know, by abusing their power yet again, they tanked the price and those trades are now worthless. But I held GME, I held through their attacks when it tankee to 100 because you guys were holding with me.


So now all I have is 4 GME shares that I will hold until we can get back at them and WHEN, not if, we win, hopefully it will help me somewhat in investing in this market - that hopefully will be a lot more fair after all of this.


A lot of people I know are asking to join and I've been helping them setting up accounts on TDA or eToro. Etoro is faster to get started but they kinda suck. Since there are no way for us to get Fractional Shares (eToro been wonky), some of my friends are putting money together to hold one shares of GME on Monday.


I look forward to the day we win this, so many things are on the line, not just for our generation, but our previous and future generations, not just for the US stock market but for all market as well as everything unfairness in the world. In the end, we might win the battle of GME but still not win much from this war of unfairness but that's a start.


So to conclude this stupid long TEDtalk. You have reinforcement from everywhere WSB. Even from places that cost 2 months wages for a share.


Let's make them pay for what they took from us and my brother tuition also! 10k per share is not a meme!!!


TLDR: Poor kid from 3rd world country holding GME because suits treated his family badly.

The question is, how much more will people pay for GameStop branded merchandise, compared
to a month ago.

GameStop's value is in that it represents rebellion and a striving for fairness- not only from the original short interest, but even more from the media and hedgies blaming retain investors.

Perhaps a stock price of $100 isn't sustainable, but $50 may be.

And this would still obliterate the hedgies, as their positions would still cost them 10-15 x their shorts, and 50-100x the calls they sold.

And if GameStop could demonstrate the legitimacy of this valuation, it would prevent SEC shenanigans that release short interest of their obligations.

ITT we brainstorm what products GameStop could brand, with the cache of their brand.
My vote is a GameStop-branded BlackBerry phone, specializing in simple games, or a unique social chat app.

Here are some others, not my own:

I could foresee a Blackberry/GameStop ecosystem that, shunned by Google, could be a good barrier to normies.

AAPL earnings were last week and they were spectacular, sales up 21% YOY, SMASHED 100 billion in revenue in one quarter for the first time ever at 111.4 billion, sales in all product categories are up double digit percentage points and bassicaly crushed the revenue estimates for every one of their product categories aside from being under by 0.01% for mac revenue (mac revenue still up 21% YOY). Earnings per share were at $1.68 vs the estimated $1.41. It's also important to note that sales in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are up 57%.

But what happened? You ask, like a wide eyed retard fresh outta mommies cunt. We've all seen this shit before, blowout earning report and a steep sell off straight afterwards. It's why only the retardiest of retards play earnings. They almost always recover after said sell off and If you look at the chart, apple is prime for a swift recovery judging by the Extremely bullish Batman throwing a batarang pattern that developed in the last few hours on friday.

https://imgur.com/gallery/KCjZdbZ

The reason I believe the recovery will be swift is because this sell off was almost certainly caused by a few big funds needing liquidity to cover their GME shorts + short more GME. Also autists liquidating their positions to buy more gme. This dip will be bought right back up by institutions that have no interest in GME.

They’re horrible at executing orders, can’t close spreads with more than two legs, constantly glitching and make stupid mistakes like forgetting to code in leap year. Throughout the years they’ve made enough blunders and whenever that happened people got mad and swore to move out but a lot of them ended up staying because other broker apps (so far) all look much more complicated and make people especially novice traders feel at a loss. 

RH is like a pretty girl with an empty head, she’s easy to use but so stupid sometimes you just want to dump her but damn she’s got a sexy body you can’t let go.

Luckily design is much easier to replicate. All we need is a new trading app that looks similar in layout but runs with a better system and integrity, like a lady that’s beautiful with brains. It will be only a matter of time before people move on and dump this stupid pos.

This isn’t speculation. I have a 3rd grade reading level but that makes sense to me somehow.

TLDR: We are this way, because it's the only way we are allowed to be, as retail traders.

Now that that's out of the way, lets look at it from a normie traders point of view.

&#x200B;

1. **Pattern Day Trading:** Why does it exist? To protect us? From what? Do you ask for a W2 for everyone literally walking into a casino to see if they are capable of losing what they are risking? No, they are free to spend as they please. Funny, I thought that's what a free market was for too?
2. **Market Makers:** You want us to literally just stop, leave, and use a casino? Use DraftKings and that sort of platform, ok. Now what, how do you make your money off of ""dumb money"" when it's gone? You need us, we need you.
3. **\*WHY\* is a collective of people on Reddit such a danger?:** For the sake of arguing, before this happened, there were 800,000 of us just being collectively dumb together. LETS JUST SAY, combined, we had 1 billion dollars between 800,000 people. That's scary? You lost 2.7b in the first wave of short losses, then asked for help for another 3b. Do you know what that means? THAT MEANS, that hedge funds, as a collective, is the problem, NOT REDDIT.
4. **When we got together, it was a crime, when you got together, it was not a problem?** How can we be ""investors"" in a rigged game, literally, please explain it. We HAVE TO GAMBLE to make money, because those are YOUR RULES.
5. **Trading is passive income, not a job:** Yeah, it's a passive way to kill time for 95% of us, make a little side money, couple grand here or there, sometimes get lucky and make 10k. This is a lot for regular people, it's literally NOTHING to you, but debt payment and vacation funds for us.
6. **We are Degenerates and Dumb Money:** If a large group of dumb people cost you money is a problem...then why is a large group of smart people (you market makers and hedge funds) that manipulate costs to take dumb moneys money away, allowed?

Anyways, there is a list 3 miles long.

GameStop isn't about GameStop, it's a beacon of reason, it could have been any stock, Citron just picked the target and we used it.

Good Luck Diamond Handing gents. Think about it this way. No matter what happens, **THEY HAVE LOST MORE MONEY THIS MONTH**, than what average day traders have collectively made in 5 years.

The media coverage is also unreal.  Unfortunately, some are painting the group as a monolithic entity -- a raging, disgraceful mob bent on destruction.

Sure - some of the language here is obscene and the culture is undeniably childish.  But let me tell you some of the stuff I've seen:

&#x200B;

\*Multiple stories of members who have used profits to buy Nintendos for children's hospitals, food for health care workers, donations to charities, etc.  This has happened many times before when members made large profits on other positions.  How many hedge fund managers would have done the same had they bankrupted GME?

\*A doctor (maybe a surgeon?) had a long-standing position on $AMD and made a significant profit.  He posted about it one day and folks were jokingly asking for money  (the typical ""hi, it's me your son...."" approach).  One person mentioned they were a medical student with a huge amount of loans.  The doctor contacted him personally, gave him advice, and helped with $ for loans.

\*Recently, a gentleman living in his car posted how he had placed $600 on GME call options now worth >$100,000.  The mantra here has been hold, hold, hold with anyone selling facing the potential of a relentless onslaught of insults.  In in this case, countless members encouraged him to cash out at least some of the position to afford housing, food, and warmth.  Countless posts of support and well wishes.  

\*Likewise, folks posted support and congratulatory messages for someone who was able to secure some profits and buy delayed christmas presents that were unobtainable.  The sheer joy in his post and his newfound ability to bring happiness to others was heartwarming.

\*Countless posts of support.  While everyone here messes around with everyone else, there is actually a really nice undercurrent where when someone is in real trouble, there is countless outpouring of support.

&#x200B;

Now - with countless bots and new accounts with unclear motives, these types of things are harder to find.  But it is important that this subreddit not be portrayed as a group of $Yahoos or a mob or whatever else the talking heads on financial news networks (with now overtly obvious motives) are saying."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185637.csv|StockTicker|['WSB', 'I']|[]|['I', 'WSB', 'K', 'GME', 'A', '$AMD', 'GME']|['GME', 'AMD', 'GME']

TL:DR: HOLD

Get ready for FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) campaigns on the weekend. It's already starting.

The number of posts with supposed ""level headed"" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think, how other stocks are also valuable, and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but still ""Go GME!! I am one of you guys!"", always with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.

Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your GME shares.

ALWAYS check the up / downvote ratio and read the comments before getting swayed by whatever semi correct sounding bullshit they're spouting. Oh how desperate they now have become.

Melvin and others who are doing the ladder shorts, scaring a few to get shares but not enough to save themselves.  Ive read that Melvin and others are paying 3% daily interest on their shorts. 

Lets assume a $1B short that went against them to the tune of $10B in losses. They are effectively paying 3% or $300M a day to maintain that short. Only they can't get out because there are no true sellers, just bullshit ladder games by other shorters. Eventually Melvin cannot pay that $300M ($1.5B a week) margije requirement. The price increases and their short goes red $20B, now they have $600M a day to carry the short. Just can't continue.  

So they become insolvent, and a bigger firm assumes the risk of their short. GME hits $10K a share and now that bigger firm has a $3B a day margin risk! They go down. 

Two ways this works out for the shorts, 1, enough people cash out so they can cover. 2 Gamestop themselves sell massive shares into the frenzy.

Why not? Well: 

Let me clear up some misinformation: market makers don’t buy shares all at once on Friday when the calls expire in the money; that would be fucking stupid. In simple terms, they buy as the chance of the call ending in the money rises (aka the stock price goes up), so they buy slowly on the days leading up to the expiration date. Their problem is that there is not enough liquidity in the market to have bought enough shares properly when those calls get exercised on Tuesday. 

Next week is going to be the biggest week in my opinion. And if they didn’t close robinhood, we would be gamma squeezed up to 700-800 by now or even more. But they did illegal shit to get away with it, and delayed the inevitable. Our friends at robinhood will have hopefully liquidated and switched brokers by Monday and set off the gamma squeeze paired with the call exercises on Tuesday and MM’s not having enough shares hedged properly to deliver. My opinion. 


You know the reason why they didn’t try that short naked ladder attack like they did that drive the price from 480 to 120 again yesterday??? Because we didn’t fucking sell. It wasn’t low enough for them to close very many short positions.

Looking at volume, at 120, nobody fucking sold. People probably bought the dip and took more shares off the market instead. They know that, that’s why they didn’t try to use it to bring the price to 120 again yesterday, and only kept it in the 250 ish range. that moment made me FUCKING TRUST YOU GUYS SO MUCH. The fact that MAJORITY STILL DID NOT SELL IS UNBELIEVABLE. They’re probably thinking the same thing. 

They’re literally shitting their pants. They have every professional risk analyst, Harvard data scientist, Harvard mathematicians, and the best financial analysts in the world working on this. 

Unless the SEC or FED step in (I don’t think the SEC will: https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/01/29/sec-reviewing-recent-trading-volatility-amid-gamestop-frenzy-vows-to-protect-retail-investors.html) They have no choice but to make us sell— and the only way they are going to do this is by psychologically torturing us until we do it. Bots spamming shit, robinhood cancelling, CNBC spreading fucking fear everywhere, short naked ladder attacks. 





TLDR ⁺ THE ANSWER? 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Turn your fucking brain OFF. trust the process. Ignore EVERYTHING you see that comes from the media, and more importantly don’t let any fluctuations in the price faze you, IT IS ALL ARTIFICIAL DESPERATE ATTEMPTS AT SURVIVING. Trust the fact that these shitheads are working literally this next 48 hour weekend straight and sweating and screaming and crying and begging for bailouts, and meeting behind closed doors to come up with more shitty tactics, which won’t work on us because were NEVER FUCKING SELLING. We sit at home with the shares jerking off and spending our time chilling, while they’re in emergency overdrive mode. The fact that we have RETAIL INVESTORS who are willing to lose the money to prove a point, and are not scared, and don’t understand that much is ACTUALLY OUR BIGGEST ADVANTAGE RIGHT NOW. 

IMPORTANT:

don’t get burnt out or they WIN. I watch the ticker all day from 8 to 5:30. It’s so draining and I cannot keep it up forever WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT. come Monday, I am not looking at the stock until 1. I’m going to exercise, eat healthy shit, drink water, spend time with the family and set some time aside NOT thinking about GME. The exact thing they want is that we lose momentum or get stressed out and sell to ease our mind. Don’t let them win. 


I own GME, this is purely speculation, I don’t know anything for certain, and it is all my opinion. I like the stock, and believe in its fundamentals and leadershiP.


 E D I T: THINKING ABOUT NOT LEAVING Robinhood yet for one reason or another? 

Copied from my response to a comment below about someone saying it would take too long to liquidate and move to robinhood: 

Don’t liquidate your GME holdings, just take your extra cash you want to put in to GME and put it in another broker account ASAP. 

Robinhood is completely controlled by the person we’re fighting against. When we had momentum yesterday, they changed the 5 share buy max to 2 then to 1. They will always kill momentum because they are owned by the people we are fighting against. They will never allow you to buy again. 

In my opinion you should have switched brokers the moment this news came out. I think you can get it set up for Tuesday which I believe will be the biggest day. Letting us by 5 then 2 then 1 share? They have professional analysts; they know the limit that can be bought for them to be successful; and they can control the buying limit. if they can do this; they are basically guaranteed a win. They are controlled by the big guys, you have to get OUT."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185631.csv|StockTicker|['RE', 'CKING', 'CARED']|[]|['CKING', 'TRUST', 'YOU', 'GUYS', 'SO', 'MUCH', 'ORITY', 'STILL', 'DID', 'NOT', 'SELL', 'IS', 'VABLE', 'SEC', 'FED', 'I', 'SEC', 'CNBC', 'TLDR', 'THE', 'NSWER', 'OFF', 'THING', 'IT', 'IS', 'ALL', 'ICIAL', 'ERATE', 'EMPTS', 'AT', 'IVING', 'NEVER', 'CKING', 'LLING', 'ETAIL', 'STORS', 'UALLY', 'OUR', 'GGEST', 'NTAGE', 'RIGHT', 'NOW', 'WIN', 'I', 'I', 'WHICH', 'IS', 'ACTLY', 'WHAT', 'THEY', 'WANT', 'I', 'NOT', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'P', 'E', 'D', 'I', 'NKING', 'ABOUT', 'NOT', 'AVING', 'GME', 'GME', 'ASAP', 'I', 'I', 'OUT']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

I know for the fact that it's going to be my biggest ""wisha woulda shoulda coulda"" regret I will be telling my grand children in future.

I watched the whole $GME saga from sidelines for past couple months and I am happy for all you retards making banks.

It's just my 30K annual salary, my stupid ass risk appetite and ever lasting debt doesn't allow me to hop on a 300$ a share price at this point. (I am in \~15K debt to be clear). Have nearly 1000$ worth spread out in $AMC $BB $NOK just because you retards suggested it and I wanted to be with you guys on (somewhat possibly) next rocket.

My rational mind tells me the $GME price's gonna go up 1000$+ mark and my ""woulda shoulda coulda"" is gonna get more intensified. But, my convicted mind tells me to keep watching from sidelines and support my fellow autistic retard buddies.

I just want to speak out one thing loud and clear to all the guys who got in at no matter what price. Just keep on Holding for your Dear Life.

All the GME left-outers love to watch the game and see hedge funds getting burned. Just burn 'em all.

The feelings of selling my grandpa's hand-made 30 year old house back in 2008 crisis and living on rent in a basement for next 5-7 years still burns my heart to ashes each time I think about it. I was a small kid back then but now I understand all of it. Every single thing.

**HEDGEFUND RISK**

First understand what's at risk for the hedge funds.  [According to S3 analytics,](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/gamestop-short-sellers-are-still-not-surrendering-despite-nearly-20-billion-in-losses-this-year.html) HFs have lost $20B on $GME so far.  Other reports have come out that [hedge funds have lost 15-20% of assets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/dan-sundheim-s-20-billion-d1-capital-loses-about-20-this-month#:~:text=Dan%20Sundheim's%20D1%20Capital%20Partners,target%20hedge%20funds'%20favorite%20positions) so far this year.  Using these two numbers we can make an estimate they have $80B at stake here ([Citadel was worth $33B on Jan. 1st](https://www.citadel.com/about-citadel/#:~:text=We%20achieve%20far%20more%20together%20than%20we%20ever%20could%20on%20our%20own.&text=Citadel%20named%20to%20Linkedin's%20Top,as%20of%20January%201%2C%202021) so I believe this to be close).  Because Citadel and Melvin struck a deal, we can assume they are all in this together.  This prevents a [prisoners dilemma](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prisoners-dilemma.asp#:~:text=The%20prisoner's%20dilemma%20is%20a,expense%20of%20the%20other%20participant) for any one of them and makes retail investors battle $80B vs. say an individual worth $2B.

Now let's assume short amount is 100% of float and they have reduced the high debt on Thursday's shady tactics.  This means to calculate daily interest we take:

* 50M shares in float ([according to Fin Viz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME))
* 25% interest rate = .25/365 = .07%/day
* Share Price = $300

$300\*.07%\*50M = $10.2M in interest/day.

At $300 share price and $80B in funds as long as they continue to acquire the minimum # of shares needed they can keep this up for ***21 years.***

*So that's their situation.  The question they are asking then is how do we improve our situation and ensure we gather enough shares to keep this going?*

&#x200B;

**HEDGEFUND GAME THEORY**

Ok so now assume you are a huge asshole that steals from poor people and has no respect for others.  You need ***shares*** and ***you want to exit your position so you can make money elsewhere***\*.\*  How do you do this?

There are three tactics likely:

1.	Settlement

* Let's go back to our shares needed (50M) and value of the hedge funds ($80B).  Dividing that out we see that if they pay $1600/share they would be bankrupt.
* To avoid bankruptcy but get out they likely will look for government intervention that has them pay $500-$1000/share
* So how would you do this?  You first use your friends to [convince retail investors that your share is worth less than $1K](https://twitter.com/realwillmeade/status/1355329408194719748).  Retail investors might even have an organization like [SEC say they are protecting us](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/sec-vows-protect-retail-investors-amid-gamestop-frenzy-n1256146) \- after all $500/share is more than retail investors paid.  You then settle behind the scenes with your cronies and come out with PR about how great this is! *(fuckers)*
* This is their best course of action because retail investors cannot do jack shit against it
* Edit: As others have pointed out the settlement could be with other hedge funds that own shares, not just government intervention 

&#x200B;

2A) Test Pricing - Low

* The first test they did was to see if they could scare us.  A [ladder attack](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l72r36/what_is_a_short_ladder_attack/) costs them nothing.  And if they keep price low enough they don't have to pay out on higher issued options.
* Clearly the ladder attack was very effective Thursday and Friday up until \~2:30pm (I'll explain why later).  I expect them to use this as needed to keep price in a range

&#x200B;

2B) Test Pricing - High

* Another strategy is to find a [price cliff](https://www.pricebeam.com/pricingpsychology#:~:text=A%20Price%20Cliff%20can%20be,share%20and%20revenue%20will%20drop).  Essentially they let price run up a bit and hope that everyone sells to lock in profits.  This is more risky and will be used cautiously.
* However I can't state this enough - **we might see price rise substantially on Monday in hopes that retail investors sell.**

&#x200B;

3) Work with GME to Issue Shares

* If they think buying is dying down, a share issuance allows them to grab a number of these shares and exit
* The reason this is not their best outcome is twofold: Retail investors can help subdue with a huge buy attack and GME has little incentive to upset a large portion of retail investors
* Still, keep your eyes out for this to happen as it will be a pivotal point

&#x200B;

Well this all sounds good and I need to get back to my yacht.  Let's do some price testing and call up our buddies to solve this in a couple weeks.  This can't go tits up.

*Wrong.  Retail Investors still have the power.*

&#x200B;

**RETAIL INVESTOR GAME THEORY**

So now you are a smooth-brained ape.  What can you do to stick it to the twats?

&#x200B;

1.	HOLD

* If everyone holds then HFs can't get shares.  This leads to a long, drawn out fight or settlement.  But guess what - at least the HFs are losing millions of $s a day and unable to screw around with other stocks
* This benefits the new retail investors because eventually your short-term gains become long-term gains (less taxes)

&#x200B;

2) BUY

* How do you prevent a wall of selling slowly lowering the price?  You build a wall of buying slowly raising the price!
* Whether you realize it or not retail investors almost lost Friday afternoon. RIs had two days where buying was diminished (fuck Robinhood) and therefore the ladder attack let HFs set whatever price they needed.  Thankfully retail investors pulled it off in the final minutes (maybe thanks to a whale)
* If retail investors continue to commit limit order buys to prevent the ladder attack from lowering price AND continue to adjust their limit order buys UP the price will go UP
* ***This is the most important though - the retail investor must commit to the idea that there is no longer a ""dip"".***  ***Price is now pre-squeeze and post-squeeze***
* If they can do this the retail investor wins.  The post-squeeze price will be where most retail investors want to sell (hopefully VERY HIGH) and all shares purchased post-squeeze will make profit

&#x200B;

3) FIND WHALES

* Anyone named Elon that wants to commit to the cause and also hates short sellers?

&#x200B;

4) DO IT QUICKLY

* HFs are spending 24/7 trying to find a way out.  The longer RIs let this drag on the longer a settlement is likely

&#x200B;

**RETAIL INVESTOR WINNING - WHAT TO EXPECT**

Now that we understand that what will winning look like?  Well we have two outcomes:

&#x200B;

1.	Successful Buy Wall Overwhelms The Shorts

* This could literally happen tomorrow with enough power
* The price will gamma squeeze, then squeeze, and then game is over
* Watch for massive market dips

&#x200B;

2) Retail Investors Own All The Shares

* While unlikely there could be a situation where everyone is HOLDING and shorts can't get their shares
* A ladder attack will lower the price to get retail investors to sell  - imagine a slow steady drop to $20/share
* After waiting it out a month or two eventually the HFs fold and a real buy and a real ask will go through at whatever the retail investors deem the share price to be (again hopefully VERY HIGH)
* EDIT: THIS IS VERY UNLIKELY AND JUST THEORY.  IT WOULD BE HISTORICAL TO SEE 100% OF ALL SHAREHOLDERS NOT PLACING AT LEAST ONE BUY AND ONE LIMIT SELL.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

* Hedge funds want to drag this out waiting for a settlement or retail investors to sell
* The retail investors best strategy is to BUY and HOLD.
* A successful retail investor strategy ***eliminates the idea that there is ""a dip"" to create a buying wall.***  There is only pre-squeeze and post-squeeze prices.
* A buying wall - supported by a swath of limited order buys - by the retail investor will move price up slowly day after day until this over
* One well-intentioned whale could end this tomorrow if they really cared
* Don't be surprised to see a settlement with government or another party come through if this drags on

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, this is for purely educational learning purposes.*

I have some serious questions about AMC. I am concerned about the fact that the floating shares just increased because AMC let Silver Lake dump $600 million worth of shares to remove their debt. The short volume was 42mil shorted shares to 52mil floated shares in Jan 15 (last date from Marketbeat) but now I believe it will be 42mil shorted to 96mil floated shares next week. Unless the shorts are dumb enough to short those shares instead of covering, we might have an issue with the ""inevitable"" short squeeze. Unfortunately AMC doesn't have the same ""guaranteed"" short squeeze as GME.

I am wondering what everyone else thinks about the situation?

My Position: 1050 shares at $4.30

Keep in my mind I got in before the Reddit hype and right after AMC announced that they have secured enough funding to be free from the dangers of bankruptcy. I figured that by summer time as moviegoers rush to the theaters, by Q2 earnings, AMC would be trading at $6-7. I never in my wild dreams though that it would be trading almost 3x my cost basis one week after I got in lol.

I like the stock!"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185640.csv|StockTicker|['AMC', 'AMC', 'DD']|['AMC', 'AMC', 'DD']|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'AMC', 'I', 'AMC', 'I', 'AMC', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'AMC', 'I', 'AMC', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'GME', 'AMC', 'AMC']

Be smart about your position and your profits. 🦍🦍 💪💪, GME 🚀 🚀 🚀 

Alright retards, put on your helmet and take that crayon out of your nose because it's time to get serious. 

Diamond handing is important. It's been the most important part of our strategy, no doubt. The concept's easy, but this volatility is enough to age us all 40 years. Not everyone, especially the newer people, are capable of stomaching these drops, so I'd like to offer a more practical (more realistic maybe) guide to diamond handing. At the very least, this guide will help you be more confident in your positions and greatly decreasing your odds of being a little bitch that sells at the first sign of red. 

&#x200B;

**If you're just joining us now and bought any of the hyped stocks at current prices or higher:**  


1. **Educate yourself.** You bought a stock, which is ownership of a company. Understand the fundamentals behind what your company. DD is not something WSB is lacking in. You have a searchbar. You have eyes. (I mean, unless you don't. That's cool too. Have someone read you DD out loud like a bedtime story. :) ) I really like [this DD on Gamestop](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/) if you want to learn some more about Gamestop. I don't know (and don't care) about any of the other stocks, so you're on your own. **Educate yourself on the company you own a portion of and you'll be less prone to paper hand.** 
2. **Don't sell at a loss.** It's just retarded. Fear is one of the worst human emotions and you'll never make money in the market if you're scared of a little red. So if you can't stand that you're down 10% on a stock that swings 50% a day, why did you buy it in the first place? Similarly, if you're down 50% on a stock, it makes no sense to sell it when it pretty much can only go up from there. This isn't to say that stop loss isn't important but I feel like I'll do more harm by trying to explain to you retards on when to use it. So for now, while the hype is still there, just hold. 
3. **Only invest what you can afford to lose.** Don't overleverage. Don't use margin. Seriously, if you're struggling to put food on the table and your last $10 are in AMC like a retard, this game really isn't for you. The reason is that you're so scared for your money that you will make the worst possible decisions at the worst time and lose that money. Don't underestimate fear and desperation. This isn't just a get rich quick scheme. 
4. **When you're up bigly, congratulations!** You win. Follow the advice for OGs. 

&#x200B;

**If you're an OG and bought Gamestop when it was double digits:**  


1. **Congratulations you big chad! :)**
2. **Consider taking a little bit of profit.** If you bought Gamestop at like $12, you are up bigly, no doubt, but it can be extremely nerve wrecking to watch your portfolio erase three years of your Wendy's salary in an hour and so you can be prone to paper handing. It will really be much easier if you sell a tiny portion of your shares to at least cover the initial deposit. That way, if Gamestop goes down to $0 (when hell freezes over, but you never know), you at least break even. It'll be easier to sleep at night. I mean, even Deepfuckingvalue does it. Be smart about it. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, it's hard to diamond hand consistently if you have trouble sleeping at night due to how overleveraged you are. It's like a diet fad. The chad that limits himself by 100 calories but sticks to it consistently will do better than the retard trying to fast 72 hours when he's never gone 30 minutes without a sugar donut. 

Be realistic and take care of yourself. It's far easier to stay consistent by doing that. 

If anybody has any questions on Gamestop, stocks, or options, feel free to ask in the comments. My DMs are open too if you're shy 😳 👉👈. 

&#x200B;

Positions: A fuckton of GME, bought both at $14 and at $300. I buy every dip and hold, I've sold my entire portfolio to feed my GME gambling addiction but I've also sold 8% of my shares to cover my initial investment so it truly doesn't matter anymore if it goes tits up.

But WHY do we know that’s bullshit? 

Well, if you’re new to investing there’s a concept called margin. Margin is essentially a line of credit given by brokerages to users to trade with. They still “own” whatever you buy with it, but you’re allowed to take profits on how you use it, paying them back with interest once you’ve made gains. If you’re not making gains, they’ll sell your stuff for you and you’ll be responsible for making up the loss.

A while back, people in financial circles were freaking out because of the “influx of you inexperienced investors trading on margin”, thinking it could cause a crash from reckless investing. Of course that’s not true, because the retail investor is on the hook for these losses. What might bring down the market is institutional investors utilizing some of the strategies that they said uninformed retail investors would do. It’s hypocrisy incarnate. You’re on the hook for your margin losses, or any cash losses. They’re trying to get hedge funds OFF the hook for theirs.

Here’s the thing though. Almost ANYONE could get an ABSOLUTE SHITLOAD OF MARGIN.

Unemployed college students and $40k/year average people were given thousands, often tens of thousands, dollars of credit to trade with. These are essentially loans that they know very few people will actually benefit from. Loans your bank would never give you. RH didn’t give a shit, because they don’t give a shit about your risk.

Once people realized buying GME with their own cash was a sure fire way to make money, they started “caring about your risk”. They’re not limiting your risk. They’re limiting your GAINS that you’d earn at the expense of hedge funds that pay them for your trading data. 

“Risk with a high likelihood of downside? Have at it. Risk with almost surefire insanely high upside? We’re gonna have to step in. “

Edit to add: yes, there’s also the (probably more impactful) reality that they likely didn’t have the capital they needed to facilitate these trades. My main point is that it’s SURE AS HELL not to minimize YOUR risk."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185640.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['WHY', 'A', 'OFF', 'NYONE', 'OLUTE', 'TLOAD', 'OF', 'ARGIN', 'RH', 'GME', 'GAINS', 'SURE', 'AS', 'HELL', 'YOUR']|['GME']

This DD needs a lot more attention. 

Ima keep this simple. The following DD posted by u/fyzle deserves more attention than it's been getting. It's simple, clear and common sense. 

Basically, about 30% of GME shares are owned by just 3 investment firms (Blackrock, Fidelity, Vanguard). Another 30% is own by other investment firms and Ryan Cohen, which brings it to over 60%... all of who have a vested interest in seeing GME moon.

If you think for one second that Blackrock, the world's largest investment fund, is going to let GME fail then you must be literally retarded. 

They do not lose money. Period. 

Citadel, Melvin and Citron are nothing compared to the might of just Blackrock alone. Throw in Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab, Susquehana Capital and a bunch of others (see link), and you quickly realize that shorts don't have a leg to stand on. 

Autists prepare for take off.🧑🏻‍🚀🧑🏼‍🚀🧑🏽‍🚀🧑🏾‍🚀🧑🏿‍🚀

Read further for more details on this retarded theory.

**Disclaimer**: I’m retarded and have been wrong in the past. This is fan fiction and fairy tales **not financial or investment advice**.

So during the last 2 weeks our wonderful subreddit blew up and is now pretty much known by every person on the fucking planet. I've looked at what is happening overall in the market vs what is happening in the high short % stocks during that time. I've selected a 2 week timeline because I believe during this time everyone on the market (including hedge funds) have discovered what's moving these stocks.

Here's the figures since January 19th (18th markets were closed). I've included the most popular high short % stocks since they're what retail investors (we) seem to be buying with our mouths foaming. I apologize if I left out your favourite meme stock, fuck you, keep reading it's about to get more interesting.

**Timeline: January 19th - January 29th**

High short interest stocks:

GME +680%
AMC +330%
LGND +47% 
SPWR +46%
SPCE +40%
BBBY +35%
FUBO +30%

Even half blind smooth brains can see they are all mooning. But why are GME and AMC outperforming the rest? We'll come back to them later. Next up is looking at the performance of other shit on the market. I've tried to select large cap stocks and indices that are relevant to the situation, you retards can go and look up the rest and **prove me wrong.**

**Timeline: January 19th - January 29th** 

Selected stocks & indices:

S&P 500 -2,2%
NASDAQ -0,5%
AAPL +3,2%
MSFT +8,5%
FB +0,5%
TSLA -5,2%
GOOGL +2,4%

What's interesting about this you say? Everything seems  normal, they're mostly flat, who the fuck cares right? You would be right, during the 2 week timeline things look pretty normal.

Now let's look what has happened since **shit hit the fan** on Thursday (28th) after Robinhood started to limit the buys on meme stocks and **EVERYONE** started to talk about wsb and retail investors hunting stocks with high short %.

**Timeline: January 28th - January 29th**

Selected stocks & indices:

S&P 500 -1,14%
NASDAQ -2%
AAPL -5,3%
MSFT -1,8%
FB -7,3%
TSLA -2,5%
GOOGL -0,5%

Everything is red. Why is that weird? For one FB, MSFT, AAPL actually **all beat earnings** released last week (TSLA missed). Why are investors not piling onto these stocks? There's multiple reasons and here's where the **nuclear bomb theory** comes into picture. I suggest you put on your cloak and wizard hat it's about to get retarded.

I believe the smart money realized what's about to happen and are exiting their long positions. By smart money I'm referring to hedge funds like Melvin Capital who are losing $3B a month. Even you degenerates here have exited your other positions and YOLO'd into GME and AMC. As many people here with IQ above 80 have earlier stated a lot of these hedge funds are piled onto the same long and short positions. The biggest short positions they're in are most likely all in the red because the short squeeze frenzy happening. They're scared shitless over the idea they might be caught in a situation like Melvin where they need to be bailed out by buddies or even worse, go tits up. Some of them saw this earlier and probably were smart enough to cover and close their shorts. Some of them have not covered or even worse may have doubled down on shorts. Since last Thursday these clowns have a planet full of 💎✊ retards bidding up their short positions.

I believe to avoid blowing up their chad funds, on Thursday and Friday they started to liquidate their long positions to be able to cover the short positions. What happens when a bunch of these suits start exiting at the same time? It tanks the stock (which I believe is happening to AAPL, MSFT, FB and many others, possibly the whole market). This leads to a cycle where even more funds want to liquidate long positions because suddenly they're losing money on the shorts (mooning) and longs (tanking). Remember these people are leveraged **TO THE TITS** so in an event where they're losing on all fronts they may be forced to liquidate positions to avoid margin calls.

Moving capital from their longs to cover their short positions will make things **even worse** for the not so smart funds that have not yet covered. High short % stocks will moon even harder due to other funds covering and the boomer long positions they are in will drill down even more. 

In this situation GME and AMC are **Little Boy** and **Fat Man** (read your history kids). They are the first and the second **Nuclear Bomb** to drop. They will suck all the surrounding capital into a mushroom cloud ascending into the stratosphere. Why are GME and AMC blowing up especially bigly? Because they do shit even your 90 year old grandma can understand. Depending how the situation evolves, other high short % stocks may or may not join them in their ride to the heavens (my opinion is they will be duds). I'm seeing a lot of turmoil in the upcoming weeks, look at what happened to VIX last week.

Positions: Cash gang, GME 💎✊ and 🌈🐻SPY FDs

Tried it with three different bank accounts. No dice. It either gave me a ""server error"" message, or it told me that a bank had to be verified.

At this point I'm getting bad vibes, try to post my screenshot (still pending with the mods), and leave it for a minute. Come back later on my PC and try again. No dice. Then, I think, well, let's try it with $100 instead of $600.

And it lets me withdraw.

OK, we'll try a bigger number.

Nope.

Now I'm sus, so I fire up OBS studio and screen record all of this shit as I go through and attempt to get it to let me withdraw any amount larger than $100. Nothing larger than $100 can withdraw, but $100 (and presumably lower) can. I kept going right up until I run out of daily withdrawals.

It looks to me very much like **Robinhood is limiting withdrawals to $100 or less and pretending it's a server error.**

This can't possibly be legal, and I don't know how it could be a server error. I'm not as strong on comp sci as I used to be, but 100 is a fucking int and 600 is a fucking int and they're both three digits and should require the exact same amount of computational power to transact/calculate/whatever.

Again, I have screenshots from my phone, and I took a screen recording as I went through and did this on my PC. Can anyone advise whether it is 1) possible that it is indeed a server error, or 2) if not, how it could possibly be legal? Cause like I said it still fucking looks to me like they're just not allowing us to get our money out.

**EDIT: These funds were settled. They had not been invested in days and were marked as being withdrawable.

There needs to be a fair market, if for whatever reason a certain market cannot remain fair, it is halted until it resumes being fair.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The DTCC can only raise cash obligations during, 1) extended hours trading after the regular session has ended or no later than one hour before the regular session begins, or 2)  when the market is closed.
2. No financial instrument can trade only one way. Either you can buy and sell at every brokerage, or neither and it is halted.
3. As a consequence of 2, only the exchanges can limit trading via a halt. There are many different halts that can be used. The three main halts that I think may be the most applicable are T12, H11, and O1 (Note: These are all NASDAQ halts, I cant find a good NYSE list of halts)
   1. T12 - **Additional Information Requested by NASDAQ** 
   2. H11 -  **Regulatory Concern**
   3. O1 **-**  **Operations Halt, Contact Market Operations** 
4. When the DTCC decides to raise cash obligations, if a clearing house cannot meet its new cash obligation in time of market open, it is deemed as a major risk and the DTCC will tell the exchanges to halt trading for that security until all clearing houses can meet the new cash obligation.
5. If a clearing house is unable to meet the obligation, the brokerages using that clearing house have the right to supplement clearing for that asset through a different clearing house. This will allow trading to resume even if a clearing house cannot meet it's cash obligations for that asset.
6. The DTCC needs to have a significant cash reserve on hand ready to lend to clearing houses that cannot meet the obligation requirements. This will decrease the likely hood that trading gets halted.
7. The DTCC is only allowed to loan its cash reserves at or below the Risk-Free Interest Rate.
8. Any brokerage and clearing house that allows a short sale to occur once the Short Interest reaches 100% of Float shall receive a monetary fine equal to 2x the market value of that trade.
9. No single trading body, institutional or retail,  can be short more that 5% of Float for more than 48 hours past the start of the next regular session.
10. Failure to comply with rule 8 results in a monetary fine for the trader/institution equal to the market value of the size of the short position which is above the 5% limit."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185643.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['DTCC', 'I', 'ASDAQ', 'I', 'NYSE', 'DTCC', 'DTCC', 'DTCC', 'DTCC']|[]

This is not a bear post🚫🏳️‍🌈🐻, just a bull trying to protect himself and maybe others from the suits & feds. 

A few thoughts to consider:

1. *A new major catalyst is probably necessary to trigger a MOASS due to the consequences of point #2*. *Early exercising of deep ITM calls may serve as a major component of that catalyst.* 
2. GME may trade up slowly (short-burn) as shorts bleed and begin to unwind over-time. This now possible because of actions taken by RH and other brokerage against retail investors, to slow upward momentum by halting the buy-side of the trade, thus allowing shorts to reconvene, degross, and reposition.  
3. If GME hits >$1000 we could potentially see some unprecedented FED/SEC intervention in the form of a ""retail-investor friendly"" bailout. I'm not familiar with the legalities and details of how this could actually play out. That being said, if the FED/SEC are concerned about a major market sell-off due to the MOASS, I expected them to strike a fixed-equity deal where all shorted shares must be covered for a fixed value. In this scenario, those with shares will profit bigly; those with calls may be left holding their bag.

I plan to exercise my deep ITM calls on Monday, just to be safe. They have no extrinsic value. Obviously, this only works for those who have the $ to exercise. 

Thoughts?

Fuck Robbing hood. DIAMOND HANDS AT $316.30 BABY -  [https://i.imgur.com/7Sf4ZXQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/7Sf4ZXQ.png)

Here is a video from Louis Rossmann explaining it - [https://youtu.be/MAqxQe0l4g0](https://youtu.be/MAqxQe0l4g0)

&#x200B;

This is for all of those who don't understand why Robin Hood, Trading 212 and all the other brokers restricted buying of $GME and $AMC.

The levels to a share purchase of a share are as follows - Broker/hedgefund  > Clearing house > DTCC

# Broker:

Robinhood, T212 etc. They are simply a platform to allow people to buy and sell shares on an app.

Hedge funds are also at this level but obviously don't need a broker like retail investors do.

&#x200B;

# Clearing House:

They provide the DTCC with collateral (usually 1 to 3%) for 2 days which can be called upon in case the broker/hedge fund cannot pay DTCC to settle the trade.

Trades are settled 2 days after the transaction takes place at DTCC level.

If the broker cannot pay up to legally settle the trades 2 days later, the clearing house is on the hook and has to pay up to DTCC.

Because of the volatility and risk of market wide collapse with trades not being able to be cleared with cash, DTCC required that clearing houses put up 100% collateral. This removes risk that the seller of a stock might not get paid cash.

&#x200B;

# DTCC:

They are the guys who replace the old paper exchange of share ownership.

They handle like 95% of all share exchanges and are responsible to ensure the market does not collapse.

Collapse in this case is if a seller does not get paid when they sell a share. This would happen for every stock on the market due to clearing houses not having the money to pay up.

# 

# Now why could you sell but not buy?

Surely the brokers are manipulating the stock to drive the price down?

This is because when you buy a stock, all of the above has already taken place. DTCC is happy that the money is in place in case the stock is sold.

Then when you sell GME, you get paid because the clearing house has already guaranteed the funds to DTCC.

They stopped buying so that the risk of sale default is minimised.

In my opinion, the brokers fucked up. Even though they CAN allow selling of the stock, they must have known that it would drive down the price of the stock by ONLY allowing selling. They should have blocked selling as well as buying until the clearing houses found the funds.

# So what did Robinhood do wrong?

Essentially Robinhood fucked up by allowing so much margin and borrowed funds to retail investors. They ran out of money to front to the clearing house. This is why they limited buys and asked for margin buyers to have 100% cash in the account.

# What about the hedge funds?

Melvin Capital fucked up with the short. They didn't have enough money to cover their positions and buy the high price cover. Citadel therefore bailed them out.

# Why could I buy $GME the next day?

Clearing houses went to banks to get lending for large sums of money so they can provide DTCC with the necessary collateral that they require, this is why the brokers could allow the retail investors to buy the stock again.

# Why did some brokers allow us to buy $GME when others didn't?

Different brokers use different clearing houses. So while one clearing house locked off a broker, the other clearing house may have been fine and not done the calculations yet.

That's why there was kind of a juggling situation between brokers allowing buys and restricting buys.

On Friday T212 did not restrict buys for cash on GME, but they completely restricted CFD on it. This is because they couldn't front the leverage themselves or through their clearing house

# TLDR:

I know we degens don't want to believe it, but the brokers did not have a choice in this.

The clearing houses told the brokers to stop the buying because they didn't have the money to guarantee that you get paid if you sell.

Restricting buying and ONLY allowing selling DID result in a manipulation of the stock price but that wasn't the main reason behind the Clearing Houses forcing the brokers to stop the buying.

In my opinion, the brokers fucked up. Even though they CAN allow selling of the stock, they must have known that it would drive down the price of the stock by ONLY allowing selling. They should have blocked selling as well as buying until the clearing houses found the funds."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185646.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['AMOND', 'HANDS', 'AT', 'BABY', 'ZXQ', 'ZXQ', '$GME', '$AMC', 'DTCC', 'DTCC', 'DTCC', 'DTCC', 'DTCC', 'DTCC', 'DTCC', 'GME', 'DTCC', 'CAN', 'ONLY', 'I', '$GME', 'DTCC', '$GME', 'GME', 'CFD', 'I', 'ONLY', 'DID', 'CAN', 'ONLY']|['GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

l8u96r|523.0|Unpopular opinion – What if they screw us ? Can we imagine a scenario if they can get along with this ?|t3_l8u96r|0.66|76|76|hot|2021-01-30 23:00:58.000000|Mekilekon|190|Discussion|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8u96r/unpopular_opinion_what_if_they_screw_us_can_we/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8u96r/unpopular_opinion_what_if_they_screw_us_can_we/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8u96r/unpopular_opinion_what_if_they_screw_us_can_we/|"None of what is below is financial advice. Do your own research and risk management.

TL;DR: The hedge funds and the lawmakers could find a way to get around the law and screw us. They always have and they always will. They have much more means that we do, and only from a probabilistic point of view, we will lose. Can we imagine a scenario where this could happen ?

&#x200B;

I know that what I about to say sounds bearish. I own my part of GME shares since before the first gamma squeeze and I have now pretty nice gains (as many of us do). I agree on the possibility for the price to reach astronomical limits due to the short squeeze. In theory, it could work.

In theory.

You think that because this is the weekend, everything stopped and will resume on Monday like nothing happened ? No. Right now, the hedge funds executives and all their management boards are certainly working on a solution to make legal what happened last week . They are right now trying to find a way to take your shares from you. And for this, they will have the help of many people, people which can be at a very high level of our society. And after this will happen, we will be the one accused of having manipulated the market. And you all know they have near unlimited means to do so. They have the money, they have politics, they have the hardware power. They have everything. You got a taste of it last week with that huge bots attack on Reddit and how they managed to manipulate the market so far.

We have the shares. And we got them legally, in all transparency, with our own and hardly earned money and we have the absolute right to buy some more at the price we want, and to sell them at the price we want.

Sure, the shares, that’s what they want. But what if they find the “legal” way to take it from you ? And worst than that: to take them from you without giving you back at least your initial investment ?

This sounds extreme. But this is what happened in 2008. They took your money and your houses, without giving you anything back. The hedge funds were protected by politics. To big to fail they said…

Well, this week they failed for a second time. What will they do now ? Sorry to say this, but most probably the same thing.

So, do you guys have an idea how they could manage to skirt the law or bypass it ? I do not live in the US, so I do not know how they could do this. If someone has an idea, please share it below.

&#x200B;

I felt I had to write this because since last week and especially since last Friday, the number of people reading reddit and especially WSB increased more than exponentially. Many people want to join this financial fight. Many of them are young (I hope more than 18 at least). Many of them are maybe putting themselves in danger.

So I just wanted to suggest you to think twice before investing all your life savings for this noble cause: will you be in financial danger if they manage to take all your investment from you ? How would you live with this ? Would you still  be able to pay your bills, taxes, and bring food on the table ? Just take a moment to think about this. There is a hight probabillity to lose it all on this.

Personally, I have a broad portfolio. If this happens, I would certainly lose a certain percentage of it. It will take some time to build it again sure… But I will not be in immediate danger (so does Melvin & Co if they lose some more billions by trying to take the price down in vain😊; In theory they will continue this practice until they really start to feel what it looks like to be in danger ; maybe for the first time of their lives ?

This is why I will hold my shares: because I bought them legally and I have the right to sell them at whatever the fucking price I want. I will hold. Because it is legally mine… and also, I just like the stock, it is doing great for me recently...

I just felt I had to write this to show to all lurkers, media, and all, that WSB is not only a forum where we YOLO our savings unconsciously. We are also people who know how to manage our risks and who care about each other.

Given that there’s already a shortage, it’s the perfect time to squeeze and teach JP Morgan and COMEX who’s boss.

The best things to do is buy futures and demand physical delivery. There are hundreds of times more paper silver traded than physical silver. Most of them are cash settled, but if we demanded the physical asset we could cause them to default and send the value of silver skyrocketing to its fair value.

Now you may have diamond hands 💎🙌 but do you have a diamond brain 💎[🧠](https://emojipedia.org/brain/)?

Sounds like a simple answer, right? Yes. Well...

Diamond hands are about holding the nerve when the red starts getting darker. Imagine being in a rocket violently shaking as it leaves earth’s orbit. The shaking is so violent you have ground control telling you to abort. But you don’t.

Now imagine being in school or work and rumours are being spread about you. No one likes you, they start to distance themselves, then they start to vilify and attack you too. They push you around, treat you like shit and no matter how many people you tell they don’t believe you.

That’s what you need to prepare for. Those rumours will be heard by your friends than your family, who believe them. But you hold your fucking nerve.

Last weak was them turning the oven on and getting the pan warmed up. This coming weak they will call everything under the sun. The hedgie-bitches may work with their buddies to start making people 401K’s and other funds shrink to nothing and there say it’s your fault. You’re the reason that America is getting bankrupted.

The US Gov may even get involved. Think you’ve seen or had enough of the last 4-5 years of politics? You haven’t seen shit. You’re now messing with Wall Street who have politicians on speed dial. These politicians only got into politics thanks to the help of Wall Street. Your Vote < Wall Street Money

Making sense?

We may have some on our side now but they will get pushed aside and told this isn’t their fight.

I’m going to end it there as I think you get the message.

I really hope we don’t get this far and they try to pull these tactics on us be who knows what sinister tactics they have hiding up their sleeves.

Please have a Diamond Hands💎🙌 & Diamond Brain 💎[🧠](https://emojipedia.org/brain/) this week

I've held AMD since November 2015 (@$1.94) and have weathered these speculative downturns many times. IMO the latest downturn is driven purely by an anticipated return to greatness due to Gelsinger's return. This confidence in Gelsinger is greatly misplaced for two reasons:

1. Gelsinger may be better than Intels past 3 dipshit ceos, but he's no Andy Grove. Gelsinger's retarded baby was Itanium, which AMD handily beat with x86_64.

2. Even if Intel burried Andy Fucking Grove in a Pet Semetary it would take years for him to turn that steaming turd of a company around. Serioulsy retards, look at AAPL when Steve Jobs returned in July 1997. The stock peaked briefly in 2000 before quickly tanking again.

This whole situation is so outlandish, farfetched, beyond imagination; something just doesn't smell right, or feel right, at least in my pp.

And so, I came, after looking at DFVs current positions again; but after that, I came up with a question - How do big firms like Melvin short over 100% and expect nobody to notice?

Or maybe... perhaps they did expect people to notice. What if Melvin and co. is actually IN on the play?

What if they saw the short interest was very high, close to or above 100% - and came up with the plan to add short positions to increase the short interest to levels that will be picked up and acted on by other firms/retail investors - and trigger a short squeeze... BUT preemptively get out of their short positions, and before they have to report their long positions etc...

Because their newer, unreported positions will be all on the LONG side.

The 'bailout' may have been necessary to increase their long positions further, or perhaps they were caught in the squeeze much faster than they had initially thought.

It could be the biggest bait and switch in (recent) financial history.

The gain porn would be unimaginable.

In the fractionally tiny chance that I'm right, I've posted this to my research related twitter account @LimeResearch - no affiliation to shitron; just in case I'm right, I want to have the proof timestamped in two places (for my movie/book deals of course).

I remember a year ago this sub was nothing but memes of J-Powell littered with rocketship emojis. Now It's GME posts littered rocketship emojis. We've come so far. 

Now listen:

If you think Wall Street is shitting their pants over the GME short squeeze you are 100% right. Jim Bianco lays out a [convincing case](https://www.financialsense.com/podcast/19847/jim-bianco-gamestop-and-great-short-seller-takedown#.YBTK3GAFZmU.twitter) that SPY was down 2% on Friday because hedge funds were dropping their ""safe"" stocks to raise capital for collateral against their rising margin debt on GME. 

But you also got to know this. At the same moment Robinhood halted purchases of GME, after calls from their hedge fund buddies, they also put on limits on $SLV. 

([Here is the list of all limited stocks](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) \- they've since added weird stuff like Starbucks, but $SLV was one of the first along with $GME and $AMC). I think that's pretty weird, considering that, unlike these other stocks, $SLV was up only a few percent on Thursday. It's even weirder when you consider that Robinhood had just been [bailed out by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult?sref=rY0z5sRB)! These fuckers are two of the worst silver manipulators out there. (Seriously. Link for [Goldman](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bank-nova-divestiture-goldman-sachs-idUSKBN1DS2C5). Link for [JPM](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html))

These banks have been raking it in on suppressing the price of silver for  decades. Look at this historical chart of silver. Does this make any sense? Silver was well over $30 for several years in the ***fucking 1980s.*** And now it's $27???

&#x200B;

The fair price of silver, conservatively is CERTAINLY over $50, but it seems that there were some strings attached to JPM and GS's little loan to Robinhood. 

I'm balls deep in GME, but am riding this silver train too. Already last week $AG and $SLV were surging despite Robinhood's best efforts. If this thing breaks, both of those tickers will at least double. My personal price target for Silver is $70. The tendies from silver will be extra sweet for me  - nothing like breaking up the greatest cartel in modern history (apologies to OPEC). 

Keep fighting the good fight apes. We'll bring these bastards to their knees. 

My positions: $GME shares, $AG and $SLV shares and July calls.

So the answer is to buy tons of AMC, NOK or BB instead because shares are affordable right now.

Does it divide from 🖐🖐🖐 ? No because they don't have the funds for 10 shares of GME in the first place.

However, they do have funds for 10 shares of AMC or whatever the NEXT meme-stock is.

🦍🦍 together strong. These are people that we have the opportunity to make community members for LIFE if we don't bully or scare them away. This only makes the next move even more explosive. 

AMC has value long-term and next week JUST LIKE WSB AS A WHOLE. We need to think about the squeez(es) next week and long term growth my friends.

So yes, buy GME AND HOLD THAT SHIT, but consider some of those cheaper options to bring in new family members.

IF 300,000 people were each to buy 300 oz of physical silver ($8,400) = 90 million oz.

90 million oz = 2,812 metric tons.

That is roughly the amount JPMorgan stores in their COMEX vault.

**Why wait until then?**

easy, usually short squeeze happens when there is a catalyst like acquisition, a new product announcement, or a surprise earning report. GME probably not going to buy or get bought out by someone and they won't announce a new product, but they will announce earnings 2 months from now that has a great chance to surprise EVERYONE.

**What do we know so far about their upcoming earnings?**

We only have information about their holiday sales:

* 4.8% increase in comparable stores sales YOY and 29.6% growth QOQ
* 309% increase in E-Commerce sales, representing 34% of total sales reaching $1.35B.
* Total sales declined 3.1% driven by an 11% decrease in the company store base.
* Australia and New Zealand sales increase 31%

Basically, GameStop closed 11% of the company stores, and still, total sales were down a minor 3.1% while comparable sales increased 4.8%. This means 2 things:

1. Physical stores are still profitable or performing very well.
2. E-Commerce Sales are now making up for the loss of sales of closed stores, leading the way for e-commerce being the main company revenue stream.
3. Covid free countries like Australia and New Zealand are still buying from GameStop helping it penetrate these huge markets.

GME on the 3Q report said that they expect positive comparable sales (which we just saw are probably going to be positive) and finally being profitable.

The key here is PROFITABILITY. GME was profitable only 3 times in the last 12Q ([https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/net-income](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/net-income)).

In the last 2Q that GME achieved profitability the stock went up.

27.3.20 was the day of announcement:

[https://ibb.co/ZJCG9hJ](https://ibb.co/ZJCG9hJ)

The stock gapped up a whopping **16%** before going down.

11.6.19 was another profitable Q announcement:

[https://ibb.co/8Pkx53L](https://ibb.co/8Pkx53L)

The stock gapped up 8.5% after earnings.

**Why is it matter?**

well if the next earning report will be a good surprise we will see the price move up the next day and if the company will show a clear path of profitability for the next years **THE SHORT THESIS WILL BE GONE AND A SHORT SQUEEZE WILL FOLLOW**🚀🚀🚀

The odds of profitability are very high with the management expecting it and E-Commerce sales booming. I conclusion HOLD TILL EARNINGS DONT SALE!!!!!!!!

**TL;DR:** The squeeze will happen when there will be a catalyst, the only catalyst for GME is earnings at the end of March, so hold tight until then and let's get the moneyyyyy🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

*This is not financial advice, do you own DD.*

Positions: 141 stocks at 14$ average price 🚀🚀

Edit: IMHO these earnings are not regular earnings, they are going to talk about profitability and hopefully give guidance to after covid because of the vaccines that give hope for the retailers. But imo the most important thing that can come out of this is if they will say that e-commerce is still rising and is a clear revenue growth stream. When this will happen the Short thesis will vanish and shorts will admit their lose. Untill then I believe HF can stay under water and pay the fees unless an early catalyst will emerge.
I'm holding until earnings if the squeeze won't squaze."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185640.csv|StockTicker|['Q']|[]|['GME', 'Q', 'GME', 'RYONE', 'YOY', 'QOQ', 'B', 'GME', 'Q', 'ILITY', 'GME', 'Q', 'Q', 'GME', 'Q', 'THE', 'SHORT', 'HESIS', 'WILL', 'BE', 'GONE', 'AND', 'A', 'SHORT', 'UEEZE', 'WILL', 'I', 'HOLD', 'TILL', 'NINGS', 'DONT', 'SALE', 'GME', 'DD', 'IMHO', 'I', 'HF']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'SALE', 'GME', 'DD']

$AMC $BB and $NOK can wait. Hell we may even have to sacrifice them. The point is none of these other tickers are in such a fundamentally flawed situation. Look at burry’s Twitter. He says GME is a once in a lifetime squeeze that we will likely never see again. And he is right. When shares get called back all hell will break loose.

All other tickers are acting to split our community’s buying power. I get it, we can like many stocks, but we need to REALLY LIKE GME until the end of next week. 

We have them by the balls on GME and every other fake squeeze going on in the market is here to serve as a distraction. Big money knows retail will chase green, so by popping off squeezes on these other tickers they are moving retail funds out of GME. I understand many of you may not like to hear this but this is bigger than us. We need to buy and hold GME if this movement is to succeed. 

I believe mods should hold a forum referendum on the topic of banning anything not GME related for the next week. Too many $AMC $BB $NOK shills are detracting from the cause, many of them are new to our sub. ONLY GME can bring Wall Street to their knees.

Why should we listen?**

Truth be told, you probably shouldn’t. I am a contrarian style investor, and I missed the contrarian signal in March, and entered the uptrend again way too late. If you read my post history, you will see a lot of bad calls and terrible advice (with hindsight, that is). That is why this is not investment advice in any shape or form. I am just as retarded as the next guy. I think, however, I might contribute some things that might not be common knowledge on WSB, and I really miss the good old DD posts amid the whole wsb-goes-vigilante-activist-investor vibe.

**Okay, I am retarded and can barely read. Give me some bullet points before I zone out?**

My main points:

 1.	The main narrative is way too one sided, and everyone’s a bull.

 a.	Remember when everyone was a bear back in March? Yeah, contrarian indicators are a thing. I missed it then and lost most of my gains from the ride down trying to call a top for the “bulltrap”.

 b.	USD shorts and treasury shorts are insanely large (historic record highs a couple of weeks ago), betting on a huge inflation spike any time now…

 c.	Market euphoria and bullishness is also insanely high – all the bears have gone into hibernation.

 2.	Everyone believes “money printing” and “stimulus” creates growth and inflation, even though there is no proof of this happening in Japan, Europe, the US or anywhere else for the last 13 years.


 3.	Magic crayons and market fundamentals agree that this rally has gotten way ahead of itself.

 a.	There is a massive RSI divergence between the top back in Feb 2020 and the 2021 top.

  b.	Valuations are pricing in perfection for nearly every company for the foreseeable future.

**Okay, genius. I’ve heard it all before. Jay Powell has our back, bulls have nothing to fear.**

Does he, really? The Wall Street narrative is “don’t fight the Fed”, and it has become a self-fulfilling prophecy ever since the (in)famous “Greenspan put”. How many of you actually paid attention back in Feb-March? Jpow didn’t just fire one bazooka and made everything fine. He needed multiple tries, and for a while there, the market did NOT care one bit what he did to rates or what insane number he pulled out of his ass for Super-QE. When the bears had exhausted themselves and passive flows started saving the day, the narrative changed into “Fed saves the day, once again”, and there was much rejoicing.

**But QE is creating a wave of liquidity, “sloshing around”, propping up stocks! The financial media told me so!**

As many of the less retarded members of this subreddit may have noticed by now, the financial media is not your friend, and they have no idea what they’re talking about most of the time. It’s all talking points they get from their favorite Wall Street or Fed sources. 

What if I told you the whole “money printing” thing was just a lie? Because it is, and demonstrably so. Sure, the Federal Reserve prints money. They print physical money. The US currently has about 1.5 trillion, or roughly 7% or the M2 Money stock (M2 is what the Fed tries to tell you is the actual amount of US dollars in circulation).

So, what is QE, if it’s not money printing? QE is the central bank buying treasuries and other liquid assets from primary dealers. Do they pay for these with money? No. They credit the value in bank reserves, so the bank may lend against the value (which they already could when they held treasuries). So the entire world want US treasuries, one of the most liquid assets in the world, and one of the most popular assets for repo collateral. The primary dealers sell these assets to the central banks to secure their balance sheets and make room for… More treasuries. What happens to the bank reserves? They stay in the central bank, and can be used as a basis for lending.

So – the banks can lend a lot more then – that means they lend money to hedge funds and other investors, and the money is put into markets! The Fed saved us after all! QE really works!! Well, [this graph](https://imgur.com/mvy8m8A) doesn’t really fit that narrative. The massive spike in 2020 is companies maxing out their revolving loans to brace for impact. Like in 2008, lending has been negative every month since the height of the crisis.

Okay, so what if the Fed isn’t really printing money. The government is clearly conjuring up money out of thin air and airdropping them to the people!

Well, they certainly are increasing their debt and spending the money on “stimulus”. I think the word is fairly misleading though. Are you “stimulating spending” if you give a homeless guy $10? Because that, for me, is the equivalent of what the government is doing. They are trying to prevent a disaster, not trying to “stimulate” growth. The gap between where we would have been without covid19 and where we actually is, is a lot bigger than a measly couple of trillion.
 
Some perspective on the “recovery” so far: https://imgur.com/OkJyOUi 

What the government is doing is trying to help people be a bit less miserable, not going out and boosting GDP to new heights. It sure doesn’t seem like the money they are giving out is actually increasing consumer spending in either case: https://imgur.com/FsE9Tsv

**But, but… Vaccines! Pent-up demand! Reflation! Dollar to zero!**

Vaccines are coming, and thank God for that. Is that really going to make the American economy explode (in a good way) though? It surely doesn’t seem like it outside the stock market. Last summer everyone were talking about how amazing Q4 would be. In Q4 everyone were talking about how amazing 2021 would be. Now people are starting to realize that 2021 probably won’t be so amazing after all, at least not until Q3-Q4. By the end of the summer, people will be talking about 2022. Noticed how nobody’s talking about a V-shaped recovery anymore? A recovery would indicate that we got back to where we started, and even though we had “insane” numbers of a quarter, we are nowhere near where we started back in February (which was already quite anemic compared to pre-2008 growth):

https://imgur.com/OkJyOUi

https://imgur.com/ROZuu7d

Lastly, about that pent-up demand. I fail to see it. Leisure makes up roughly 6% of GDP. Sure, people will start eating out again, they will go to amusement parks, they will get haircuts and pedicures, but will you make up for what you didn’t spend on it last year? 4 haircuts a month? 5 trips to Disney World? Eating out 8 days a week? The money has already been spent on RVs, computers, consoles, home remodeling and kitchen appliances. If anything, people might be spending less on these things than they did before covid. Evidence also points to Americans becoming more frugal and saving more to weather the next storm. I think “reopening” and vaccines will be a non-event.

**Okay, I got this far. Why now? Why can’t we get SPY 400? 500?**
 
Warning. Magic crayons ahead. Consider yourself warned.

This is the S&P back in 2018:

https://imgur.com/66Prpwa

Notice how the RSI falls while the price increases? This is called divergence. It is considered a fairly reliable signal that something is amiss. The market made a new low, but the RSI didn’t? Better sell your puts and consider buying calls. The market made a new high, but the RSI didn’t? Vice versa. Some of you might happen what came next, but here is a picture:
 
https://imgur.com/E0C005O

Okay, not conviced? I get it. Here is the S&P early last year:

https://imgur.com/vXuZaCQ

I probably don’t have to tell you what came next, but you can clearly see it on the final graph:

https://imgur.com/ASdHAtx

Notice anything else? Exactly. The market is soaring once again. The RSI? Not so much. Make of it what you will.
If you look closely at the last picture, you will see that the S&P over the last week has gone from sitting comfortably on top of the 21 day moving average, to falling through. On Friday, we closed below the 50 day moving average. That was my cue for loading up 🌈🐻 style. If we close above the 50d on Monday, I will cover and wait for another signal. I don’t have the time to cover passive flows now, that will have to wait – what you need to know if you load up on short term puts, is to get rid of everything before Friday Feb 19. The last week of the month is not a good time to be a bear, because dumb money is buying every index."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185643.csv|StockTicker|['DD', 'I']|['DD']|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'WSB', 'I', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'USD', 'US', 'RSI', 'NOT', 'QE', 'QE', 'I', 'US', 'US', 'QE', 'QE', 'US', 'QE', 'I', 'GDP', 'A', 'I', 'GDP', 'I', 'I', 'SPY', 'P', 'RSI', 'RSI', 'RSI', 'O', 'I', 'P', 'CQ', 'I', 'RSI', 'P', 'I', 'I']|['DD', 'GDP', 'GDP']

Therefore, they employ strategies that will yield the best returns on a quarterly or yearly basis. 

Why is this bad?

Because while they can make money 99 quarters out of 100, during that that 1 quarter where they lose money they lose all of it. 

That means your investments may increase 10-20% a year or whatever boomer gains they promise you, and continue to do so for several years, but one black swan event will pretty much wipe you out. 

For example: 

1999 = everyone wiped the fuck out

2008 = everyone wiped the fuck out

2020 = everyone wiped the fuck out

The hedge fund managers are fine though, because they got paid fat bonuses every quarter while delivering those boomer gains while exposing you to more and more risks. 

And Wall Street? Wall Street gets bailed out. Every time. The people who gambled the economy away is rewarded whether they win or lose. 

What we ought to do is educate people on where to find the tools and resources that will help them make more money than investing in hedge funds. Persuade people to withdraw from hedge funds and become a retail investor. 

Also, when hedge funds do shitty things like trying to destroy a company which employs thousands of minimum wage employees during a fucking pandemic, we catch those hedge funds with their pants down (edit: by exposing them)

It doesn’t matter if you’re a liberal or a conservative, straight or gay, religious or atheistic, black or white, old or young, smooth brained or wrinkly brained... we have a common enemy and its name is Big Money.

RH was actually investigated and the SEC confirmed the company had been misinforming and misleading investors in inaccurately reflecting market prices in the app, costing individual investors millions of dollars (at least). [SEC Probe](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321)

It’s also been questioned whether these shares are actually even hitting the market, as noted by some well established professionals like Erik Townsend. The validity of this is beyond the scope of my knowledge. 

Assuming all this information is true, we can assume that Citadel or subsidiaries/partners (say, short sellers or other large clearinghouse partners) owned a large part if not all these shares, simply trading them back and forth in a room of their own, disconnected from the market itself, at prices that may not reflect the true price of the stock. As we continued to buy and hold, some sold for MASSIVE profits, Citadel, and the shorts began to lose on their positions, meanwhile Robinhood was making just cents on every trade, while paying out said MASSIVE profits. 

It was at this point the house of cards began to fall. The clearinghouse is forced to sell and buy in the actual open market as shares continued to be lost to the retail investors, in tandem with the SEC probe from earlier, it spoiled their scheme to scrape cash off the top of these trades. Without this scheme running, and with a mass portion of RH investors turning to only a handful of stocks, RH likely found themselves losing ENORMOUS amounts of cash. As stated by Vlad Simpnev himself they had to take out lines of credit to support this shitty system. 

Ultimately, RH found themselves in a position where if  they don’t do anything they will likely not be able cover the payouts to their investors bagging 10K-10M every other minute of the day. Moreover, in this instance their clearinghouse may well have lost ungodly amounts of cash or worse (bankruptcy), thus leaving RH without a clearinghouse as well. The alternative is what they chose, restrict all trading on this handful of stocks to try and reestablish order in their shitty system while also essentially bailing their clearinghouse out of billions in losses, thus “saving” the company. 

TLDR; delete Robinhood their business model is absolute shit, just like their CEO. They will continue to restrict, and may even go bankrupt without the ability to pay out your investing account.

2) The amount of people that have joined this sub. Okay I know the first thing people will do is check me. I got massacred by PRPL gang (fuck those mattresses), MSFT 200c, I saw GUH the day it was posted, and even IronyMan when his balls touched the ground. So why the young account? Well, it's because of the suspensions, this is my third account and I like my current username even though most of the time it does go tits up for me. 

We went from 1.5M to 7M in the shortest period of time. This is ridiculous. Everywhere I am seeing those who make it pretty damn obvious that they just joined because they saw us on the news and don't know wtf is going on. It's annoying. Is there a way to filter out?

**WRONG**.

These motherfuckers will be attempting to bottle up our autistic tendencies and use them as a nuclear weapon to enrich themselves. Weaponized autism has been harnessed since the beginning of WSB but this latest event is up there with the discovery of Nuclear Fission and the invention of Chicken tenders. Please do not underestimate how crafty these slimy cunts will be now that our true power has been revealed to the world.

Significant resources will be directed and unleashed here (if it isn't already), I'm talking Cambridge Analytica/Nation-State bot farm level attacks to influence and control narratives, they will run clever and subtle social media strategies. Everything will be camouflaged as grassroots to lure us in and bite the poison apple.

We cannot let this happen but I'm afraid I do not come with answers or solutions, we need to crowdfund our defenses. We must be vigilant after this historical event plays out and we must protect the sub at all costs. This is about to become a real-life game of Among us.

&#x200B;

If you have looked into the short squeeze on VW in 2008, you would know that it was Porsche who onset this squeeze by announcing on SUNDAY, October 26, 2008, that they had acquired a \~ 74% interest in the company including \~ 31.5% in cash-settled options. 

&#x200B;

 Because Porsche was quietly building their position in VW, counterparties knew it would cause observable upward pressure on the stock price and decided they needed to hedge their written positions by buying the underlying stock. They also found that they could reduce their hedging costs by lending the underlying to short sellers. 

  
 At this point, there was only \~ 5.5% float due to Porsche's \~ 42.5% combined with 31.5% hedges by Porsche counterparties and \~21% protective stake held by the State of Lower Saxony. At the same time, short interest on the stock was around 13%. The short sellers were essentially in an infinite squeeze.

&#x200B;

The difference HERE is that Porsche held the cards. They offered to settle positions on \~5% of their positions to allow short sellers to meet their obligations. They made a KILLING - estimates are between $6bn - $12bn on much less short interest.

&#x200B;

This whole play was PORSCHE. PORSCHE decided when they wanted to take THEIR profits to benefit THEMSELVES. Fair Play. 

&#x200B;

BUT what is happening right now, THIS is potentially a MASS redistribution of wealth that has NEVER been SEEN BEFORE. REMEMBER THIS!!! This isn't one company making massive profits at the expense of Wall Street, this is THE PEOPLE, fighting back...and WINNING.

&#x200B;

NOBODY has to sell, but THEY have to BUY! Remember that. $1000 is not the end game, THEY will come again with their scare tactics but the line CAN be HELD, WE saw it FRIDAY.  🤚🏼💎🤚🏼... See you on the moon.

Friday AMC stock close: $13.26. Basically, the same price as a movie ticket.

Here's the data:

1. Stock float (Shares available to be traded): **106.60M**
2. Short float (percent of shorted shares): **41.91%**
3. Average trading volume (Shares traded in a day) including this week's activity: **84.62M**
4. Friday's trading volume (with buy restrictions in place): **594,653,177**
5. Short price **$2.15**

Now you have the data, here's the point...

Short ration is still well over 0.5! That means these bastards aren't giving up. They want to see the stock drop below $3.00, crush the company, and kill the largest employer of high school deadbeats in the country. Some short positions are moving out, but not many. Even with platforms buy restrictions in place the daily volume was 7x the average. 

Aside from the financials, people will be flooding movie theaters soon! People who haven't been to a theater in years will be piling in to see Top Gun 2, The Matrix 4, etc. **BECAUSE THEY CAN!** Movie theaters were taken away from all of us and people will be going back simply because there was a time they couldn't!

This list is a work in progress but I had to make something because I got tired of trying to remember what shit company to avoid and what person is screwing us over while pretending to be our friend. So below is a list, an uncompleted list but a list none the less. Please help me finish it!

**The obvious foes:**

* Melvin Capital
* Citadel LLC and firm partners - invested $2 billion into Melvin
* Point72 Asset Management's - invested $750 million into Melvin
* RobinHood
* Citron Research and Andrew Left
* Citadel Securities

Next song, Rage against the Machine - Guerrilla Radio

**The not so obvious foes:**

* CNBC - FUD spreader
* Jim Cramer - FUD spreader, 'don't go for the homerun'
* Steve Cohen (the billionaire owner of the New York Mets) and 'I'm just trying to make a living' [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-mlb-owner-steven-cohen-210726997.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-mlb-owner-steven-cohen-210726997.html)
* Google - taking down bad reviews of Robinhood
* Leon Cooperman - billionaire boomer, hedge fund backer, ""The reason the market is doing what it’s doing is people are sitting at home getting their checks from the government, okay, and this fair share is a bullshit concept.”
* Any media spreading FUD and not covering the real story (please post who with links)

   * Trading212
   * Toro

I'm not a financial expert. This is my personal opinion on what might happen with $GME in the next two weeks, based wholly on guesswork. *There's a very good chance there's something that I don't fully understand about the situation and thus I may be talking out of my ass here*.

A lot of people are expecting big moves in the coming weeks- possibly as early as Monday or Tuesday. It's definitely possible that we'll see some crazy stuff go down.

That said, I personally am considering a different possibility- that we'll see a repeat of Friday, where the price stays largely level and stable the whole time. Maybe a couple of smaller dips and peaks here or there, to make things seem realistic, but perhaps $GME might close out in the low to mid $300s all week.

Why might this happen? Well, clearly they realize by now that manipulating the market to artificially drive the price down does not induce panic sell-offs like they thought it would. The more they try to stomp the price down, the angrier and more ardent people get about holding that precious, precious stock.

So- and, again, this is where the speculation comes in- they might try keeping things nice and level. They might be at a point where they're realizing that buying back those shorts at $300 each is a lot better for them than $10,000. How to convince people to sell at $300, though? Just hold the market stable. People have short attention spans, and after a week of massive moves, seeing the price hover within a $20 range might bore a lot of people. Not only that, but the longer this goes on, the more the average person might be inclined to believe that $300 is the real price target for $GME after all.

It's just a thought. I could be totally wrong here.

**TL;DR**: MM and hedgies might manipulate the situation in the coming weeks to slow things down and make it seem like $300 is the real top for $GME, thus people could start selling not wanting to miss out on what they think is the ""peak"". They know forcing the price down doesn't work, so they could very well try to hold it steady instead. This is purely speculation and not advice, and I could be wrong about this whole thing."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185640.csv|StockTicker|['A', 'I']|[]|['$GME', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'I', '$GME', '$GME', 'I', 'MM', '$GME', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Yesterday I was in the airport of a city thousands of miles from my home. I saw a guy scrolling / laughing to himself and I thought… “You know, this guy looks a little retarded - I wonder…”

I approached cautiously. Still from afar, like a true creep I spied on his screen - Even from a distance I could tell that he was, indeed on reddit. After a moment, he looked up. I simply said:

“WSB?”
“YEAH!”

It was 100% a little weird at first, but honestly, we felt a kind of kinship immediately - and although I have felt like part of something special over the last few weeks, actually meeting one of you dummies in real life hit different.

We talked a bit about our positions (ha), how we helped save a movie theater chain. History being written. Balance of power shift. What it all means. etc. etc. etc.

As much as we joke here at WSB, yesterday was a perspective shift for me. I usually think of you guys as a bunch of faceless (if entertaining) internet fairies with impeccable foul language.

But yesterday I boarded a plane bound for home with a new friend from thousands of miles away and it made me understand that there are 6 (wait, now 7 holy shit) MILLION living, breathing people with names, faces, and stories out there. We're all doing something important together.

It was really significant moment for me - and I’d be stoked if there was a way I could help more of us experience it.

I’m so proud to be one of you retards.

Talk to your mechanic/tire shop find out if they know a working family with bald tires you can help be safe on the road.

School principals know who is coming to school in shoes with holes in the winter.

Community summer camps have scholarships and they will know which families can only send their kids for a week or two due to finances. 

Oncology center social workers know who's financially barely making it through treatment or someone who would be ecstatic over an unexpected Door Dash Friday night meal.


Every community has homes for women after incarceration or addiction, helping them learn how to hold jobs, manage their finances, etc, with the hope of reunifying families.

Most states have some sort of Grandparents Raising Grandchildren association. They know who is in their 60s and 70s raising children alone on Social Security and can use money for sports equipment or orthodontia or a night off from cooking.

Regional spinal injury centers will know who badly needs a new wheelchair or other adaptive equipment they cannot afford. 

Most communities have a foster/adoptive family group that tries to keep supplies for children suddenly removed from home. They often come with nothing and the foster families have a lot of immediate needs. 

Every Hospice will know of a caretaker spouse that could use a sitter once a week so they could get a full night's sleep.

Just a point of interest: GameStop makes almost nothing from new game/console sales. The absolute best thing that you can do for the company from a business perspective is bring some stuff to trade, get the membership, and buy used. It also helps the employees there as they are HEAVILY pressured to meet these quotas.

The reason they claimed users were only able to buy a limited amount of shares or trading was restricted was because of ""clearinghouse-mandated deposit requirements related to equities \[increasing\] ten-fold"". Basically, when you buy and sell shares, it goes through a clearinghouse, which connects the buyer and seller. The clearinghouse requires the broker to put down a certain deposit based on a number of factors, and robinhood is claiming they couldn't pay for the deposit, thus they had to restrict the buying of shares of certain stocks.

But when volatility increases, many brokers decided to a) not restrict trading or b) increase margin requirements. This seems like the logical choice, no? Instead of barring users from trading, or trading very little, instead, you can increase margin requirements to cover the cost of the deposit.

They also posted this a full day after locking down trading, and yet only selling was allowed? Firstly, if you're going to lock down trading, at least let the users know why immediately after you put the restriction in place. Second, if you can't cover the deposit, then why are you allowing selling? If you claim that you're locking down trading due to ""extreme volatility to protect customers"" then why are you only allowing selling?

Not only that, but you also forcibly sold customers positions on margin, and sold options before market close on the expiry date.

This whole situation seems very fabricated. Not very happy with robinhood, and I've already moved my money out a long time ago for other sketchy stuff robinhood does.

I bought in to GME in February last year when I started exploring the stock market a bit more heavily. It was just something cool to do and I only used money I wouldn’t miss (which isn’t much since I don’t exactly make a whole lot). I’ve been letting it sit ever since.

Over this last week or so, it’s been really surprising to see people actually rooting for us. We went from a store that had a loyal customer base to one that people want to shop at now that they 1) remember we exist or 2) just want to support the underdog. There have been so many times over the years I’ve worked here where my faith in the company wavered, and that’s not surprising given some of the really bad calls made over time. People were getting tired of us and our old ways and the changes were too little too late. Until now.

I have people coming in to chat who didn’t even intend to buy anything but doing so anyway. People calling telling me to buy GME and hold (I already am). People who actually want us to succeed. After years and years of negativity I’m honestly starting to feel just a little of the love, and hopefully it grows from here.

Thank you for all you guys do, and know you’ve got a few (actually probably a lot) of people on the inside rooting for you too.

No wonder the skimmers and scammers and political refuse that passes for ""leadership"" in today's America are shocked, shocked by the open and openly gleeful democratized speculation that (like cryptocurrencies) is enriching the wrong people, i.e. commoners.

It's as if the debt-serfs, tax donkeys and decapitalized peasants stormed the castle at night and broke open the jewel box and the stash of champagne, and proceeded to swing from the chandeliers, mocking the self-serving privileged who'd been pillaging the nation for decades via their legalized looting.

Where do these developments lead? An interesting question. Unfortunately for Wall Street insiders and their political-scum apologists, we can't unsee the levers behind the curtain."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185654.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|[]|[]

No! Don’t do it. You need to switch to an established broker that has in-house clearing. 

Here is a list of which brokers use which clearing houses. 

https://investorjunkie.com/stock-brokers/broker-clearing-firms/

If it says “Apex” - stay the hell away. If it says Self clearing: No - stay the hell away. 

__*I know Rh is now self-clearing, but they do not have anywhere close to the required liquidity to handle the current volumes - so stay the hell away.__

It doesn’t matter if you are GME or AMC gang or if you don’t plan on owning any of the meme stocks. Liquidity issues will effect other stocks too. Robinhood had to limit stocks like AMD, GM and even Starbucks. They can not keep up. Most of those other brokers also use the same clearing house - Apex Clearing. That’s a lot of volume to handle. They will be the weak link in the chain that causes the whole system to fail. They already did on Thursday. All the sketchy  shit pulled by various brokers was a direct result of Apex’s inability to keep up with demand. 

TLDR - find your broker on [this list](https://investorjunkie.com/stock-brokers/broker-clearing-firms/) and if they say “self clearing -no” then you really should switch to a broker that is self-clearing

Most of them will be unretarded GME holders who are holding most of GME floats right now and don't share our love for the stock. Some of them will be fellow retards who have to give their dog surgery or put their girlfriends boyfriend through college, some of them may be you. Whatever the reason you will put up a sell order there is one thing to remember.

**WHILE IT IS IMPORTANT STOCK GOES UP IT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT STOCK DOESNT GO ALL THE WAY DOWN**

This 🚀🚀🚀🚀 will keep flying as long as it doesn't hit the low price points that let hedges buy out their shorts. This means that even when GME drops at some point, as long as it doesn't drop low enough for hedges to cover, the fuel will keep coming. There is an easy way to keep this up.

**IF AT ANY POINT YOU FUCK UP AND SELL STOCK PUT DOWN A LOWER BUY ORDER AT THE SAME TIME**

As far as we know, hedges need to cover shorts at the < $320 range. If GME rockets to $1000 for example, and you need some cash to not starve to death and sell a share at $1000, immediately put down a buy order above $320. That way even if the stock falls a bit because of your paper hands, it will cushion at the new buy orders and start climbing back up.

**IF EVERYONE WHO SELLS PUTS A BUY ORDER AT A PRICE POINT THE STOCK CANNOT FALL BELOW THAT PRICE POINT**

I have no idea what is coming the next week or maybe even the next month. Maybe you retards crash the world economy. Maybe the stock will shoot high up and fall back down for a bit. I don't think however that the stock will tank all the way down to tens of $. There are too many of you retards who have bought up GME, locked it in a vault of your autism and thrown away the key. In normal stocks when price falls, people panic and sell until there is nothing left. You retards don't know how to sell and there is way too many of you.

The main explanation given for how that comes is naked shorts. 

What I want to understand is whether the same actual share can be sorted multiple times. 

For simplicity let’s assume no one has instructed their broker not to lend their shares. 

Let’s take an example where we have:

-	(A) - long GME
-	(B) - short GME
-	(C) - wants to buy GME
-	(D) - wants to short GME

(A) has bought 1 GME share. 

(A)’s broker has lent the share to (B) to short sell it. 

(C) buys the 1 share in GME. (C) has no idea that the share they are buying was sold to them by a short seller. 

Can (C)’s broker now lend that share to (D) to short it?

If not - why not? Forgetting any philosophical position around short selling overall, (C) has paid full price for a share, they should be able to make money by lending it. 

And what technical mechanism prevents this?

If yes, how are issues like voting and dividends dealt with. There is only one share but now two people own it - that doesn’t magically create 2 votes and 2 dividends.

Let's discuss how this actually plays out, the impact on the broader market, and some alternative plays (SPY puts?)|t3_l8w198|0.83|44|44|hot|2021-01-31 00:21:11.000000|smears|80|Discussion|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8w198/can_shorts_actually_afford_to_pay_out_a_moass/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8w198/can_shorts_actually_afford_to_pay_out_a_moass/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8w198/can_shorts_actually_afford_to_pay_out_a_moass/|"I am trying to think through this GME squeeze thing and am having a hard time wrapping my mind around how this actually plays out and we get away with a win and money in our pockets. I have not seen much discussion about this even in posts that are very knowledgeable about why this MOASS should happen.

I have a full grasp of the concept, I’ve been in it since November. My biggest problem though is where does our money actually come from if a serious, monster squeeze goes down?

And, should those of us with other holdings be buying SPY puts as a hedge, or as a cheaper correlated MOASS play?

**How do we get our money?**

In the situation being kicked around across the internet with people demanding 1k, 5k even saying 30k a share.. I’m thinking “ok but who can actually pay that cold hard cash that I can then take out to buy a house?”

The answer is of course the hedge funds by liquidating their positions elsewhere, using all the cash in their reserves and going bankrupt. So first off, wouldn't this cause a drop elsewhere like an immediate sector rotation as they panic sell? And maybe the situation isn’t that dire and paying the squeeze is doable by these funds- but maybe someone can confirm if they actually have that sort of money?

But then the next leap is if they can’t pay then the money comes from who? MMs and brokers who sold the positions? Will the same people who shut us out of the market actually pay that? And if so, where does that come from- the same place of liquidating? Or if they spend all their dry powder on this, doesn’t that shake the market?

Basically- wouldn’t the true, ultimate MOASS crash the stock market? Am I being crazy here?

**Outcomes Breakdown**

That brings me to- should we be hedging our other positions/sneakily playing the GME squeeze with puts? Here are some outcomes I've thought through:

* Situation 1: I am over stating this, shorts have the money in their reserves and can take loans etc and will cover if they have to- they just don't want to. Or there is no squeeze as they wait it out and escape. Loss on puts, possible loss on GME
* Situation 2: We are stuck at this level more or less for a few weeks or experience a TSLA-like melt up. People continue to sell other positions to move into impending squeeze, big buyers get wary of volatility and move to cash short term- small dip in SPY and GME is a slow tendie cooker.
* Situation 3: squeeze happens soon and violently, hedges fire sale to cover, there is an immediate medium but short market dip.
* Situation 4: hedges are bankrupted in a day or two of the MOASS and still have a ton left to cover, money has to come from elsewhere. Funds are pulled by big boys to pay out the losses. Robinhood and small brokers go bankrupt. Chaos and loss of confidence in the markets- large market dip/actual financial crisis??
* and my least favorite, Situation 5: if it’s true the MOASS would crash the market and that’s why they blocked it from happening this week, won’t they shut down the market before they let it happen? In this scenario, they close the market for the day, get the shorts to agree with GME management to issue millions of shares at a set rate they can afford, then tell all of us “get fucked, you don’t deserve to profit off a short squeeze but now you have shares in a fundamentally sound company which you said you like so you should be happy?” Gme goes down to its “real value,” GME management gets billions to work with, maybe they give us a juicy dividend and become a gaming powerhouse, spy life goes on. Long term hold so not an absolute disaster, but ouch. Lots of anger.

As a last thought- If someone smarter than me steps in and says “yes it’s true, there is no way there is enough money to pay anything over $1k/share outstanding and that is totally where we are going,” does that change our strategy? Because isn’t it better for us all to have $1k a share in hand than an IOU for 20k/share that will never be paid by a bankrupt hedge fund and bankrupt Robinhood, and a class action suit that goes nowhere? Plus it hurts us all to crash the market for real.

Open to any discussion on this end game.

**TLDR:** Would a MOASS crash the market because hedge funds and whoever else ends up responsible needs to pull money from elsewhere? And if so, should we be hedging or even buying cheap correlated plays through SPY puts? Lastly- if that is the case, we need to think about if the powers that be would let that happen, and how they would actually handle it.

These disgusting crooks have taken the market manipulation to a new level. When the small guys win, it’s war. 

If you don’t already know, Citadel is a hedge fund that (ran) Melvin Capital Management. 
Citadel owns Robinhood. The blatant restriction of trading stocks and crypt0 is a clear sign that Robinhood does not give a fuck about you, your tendies, or any other trader on their platform. Greasing the pockets of the wealthy is much higher on their list than ensuring traders a fair, open, competitive market.

The only way to win this battle is to boycott Robinhood, and any subsidiaries of Citadel LLC. Furthermore, we must file SEC complaints, and sue Robinhood. (Which we have already started!) We can not allow the rich, greedy, immoral tendie-thieves in power to thrive once again.

Like they did in 2008.

This is a monumental economical achievement, which will be written about in the history books. We took down a greedy, overreaching hedge fund. 

But the fight is not over. This is bigger than Citadel. This is about the continuous market manipulation that is allowed to go on behind our backs, while the 0.1% continue to thrive and prosper.

This is my personal research into Pacific Gas & Electric Company. They have perpetuated evils on the environment and mankind. Not an endorsement- just some compiled findings. 

None of this is financial advice, and is purely fiction.

**MY FIRST DD AND ACTUALLY IDK WHAT I WANNA SAY BUT I RESEARCH A LITTLE SO LOOK IF U WANT, LET ME KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAVE ANY MORE TO ADD TO THIS CASE THANKS.**

*General Background*

>Sector: **Utilities**  
Industry: **Electric Utilities**  
>  
>PG&E Corp. is a holding company, which engages in generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and natural gas to customers. It specializes in **energy**, **utility**, **power**, **gas**, **electricity**, **solar and sustainability**.   
>  
>The company was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in San Francisco, CA.

[CHART & FINANCIALS](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-PCG/)

PG&E has a large market cap coming in at $22.684B. And had a revenue of $17.129B.

So why does it have such a negative cash flow? 

    A quick glance at the EBITDA also shows a glimmer of hope. But this metric can be misleading given the nature of the utility industry. Where depreciation and amortization can way heavy on their expenses, replacing power plants and equipment over their vast network is expensive. 

*The Compounding Risks*

You may have heard of how catastrophic this company has been to the environment and people of CA.

>In the last nine years, California has seen a growing number of unnatural disasters that have taken the lives of more than 90 people and caused more than $40 billion in damages. They all have one element in common: They were caused by California’s largest investor-owned utility, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E).

[HISTORY SOURCE -- LETS OWN PG&E](https://letsownpge.org/history/)

The impacts of these events can be felt for decades. Litigation is expensive and also takes years. 

    For example:
    In 2019 they paid $11B  for the California wildfires that torched wine country back in  2017 and for the Campfire in 2018 that killed 85 people and destroyed the town of Paradise, CA.

[2019 $11B SETTLEMENT SOURCE](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/13/760479525/pg-e-to-pay-11-billion-insurance-settlement-over-wildfires-in-paradise-and-elsew)

The litigation expenses caught up with PG&E.

**They filled chapter 11 bankruptcy on January 29th 2019.**

*What is chapter 11 bankruptcy, more specifically ""debtor in possession""?*

>Chapter 11 is typically used to reorganize a business, which may be a corporation, sole proprietorship, or partnership. A corporation exists separate and apart from its owners, the stockholders. The chapter 11 bankruptcy case of a corporation (corporation as debtor) does not put the personal assets of the stockholders at risk other than the value of their investment in the company's stock. A sole proprietorship (owner as debtor), on the other hand, does not have an identity separate and distinct from its owner(s). Accordingly, a bankruptcy case involving a sole proprietorship includes both the business and personal assets of the owners-debtors. Like a corporation, a partnership exists separate and apart from its partners. In a partnership bankruptcy case (partnership as debtor), however, the partners' personal assets may, in some cases, be used to pay creditors in the bankruptcy case or the partners, themselves, may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection.  
>  
>Section 1107 of the Bankruptcy Code places the debtor in possession in the position of a fiduciary, with the rights and powers of a chapter 11 trustee, and it requires the debtor to perform of all but the investigative functions and duties of a trustee. These duties, set forth in the Bankruptcy Code and Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, include accounting for property, examining and objecting to claims, and filing informational reports as required by the court and the U.S. trustee or bankruptcy administrator (discussed below), such as monthly operating reports. 11 U.S.C. §§ 1106, 1107; Fed. R. Bankr. P. 2015(a). The debtor in possession also has many of the other powers and duties of a trustee, including the right, with the court's approval, to employ attorneys, accountants, appraisers, auctioneers, or other professional persons to assist the debtor during its bankruptcy case. Other responsibilities include filing tax returns and reports which are either necessary or ordered by the court after confirmation, such as a final accounting. The U.S. trustee is responsible for monitoring the compliance of the debtor in possession with the reporting requirements.

[US COURTS -- CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY](https://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-11-bankruptcy-basics)

Chapter 11 bankruptcy is going to come with added risks.

* The ability to develop, consummate, and implement a plan of reorganization with respect to PG&E Corporation and the Utility during the Chapter 11 Cases that satisfies all applicable legal requirements, including the requirements of AB 1054;
* The ability to develop and obtain applicable Bankruptcy Court, creditor, and regulatory approval of a successful plan of reorganization and the effect of any alternative proposals, views, and objections of official committees, creditors, state and federal regulators, and other stakeholders, which may make it difficult to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization in a timely manner and by June 30, 2020;
* The risk that the Note-holder RSA, the Subrogation RSA, the TCC RSA or the PSAs could be terminated; So far there is compelling evidence that there are a number of headwinds going forward.

These are 3 out of 17 risks PG&E is recognizing, with the possibility of more unseen risks. 

[2019 PCG 10k FILLINGS](https://last10k.com/sec-filings/pcg#i_0_40)

*What's next?*

So far there is compelling evidence of significant headwinds in PG&E's recovery.

1. Continuing litigations and settlements are costly.
2. Debt restructuring will come with its own risks. 

As a result of the wildfires Public Safety Power Shutoff was created.

**M A G I C   K A R P   T O   T H E   R E S C U E ! ! !**

**January 19th, 2021**

PG&E signed a multi-year, multi-million dollar contract with Palantir to provide Foundry software.

>Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) has initiated deployment of Palantir’s Foundry software to provide a single, integrated platform to give decision-makers a real-time, complete operational picture.  
>  
>The use of this novel technology, in its early stages of deployment, has already enabled PG&E to make effective, timely, data-driven decisions related to its Public Safety Power Shutoff program and is intended to further inform its wildfire risk mitigation programs and initiatives in the future.  
>  
>“Our engagement with California’s largest investor-owned utility underlines our commitment to increasing safety and reliability for customers and communities across the region,” said Olivier Farache, Palantir’s Head of Utility Sector and Senior Advisor to the CEO. “It shows our Foundry software can power data-driven decisions that aim to improve service delivery.”

[SOURCE](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210119005164/en/Palantir-Providing-Technology-to-Enhance-Safety-and-Reliability-of-Electric-Grid-in-California)

The increasing size and magnitude of PG&E's operation innately led to an increase in disasters.

 & Corruption within the company have slowed recovery and any efforts towards lasting change on its infrastructure.  

With the use of Foundry this could be the start of less wildfires and a more efficient utility company. 

The road ahead is a tough one for PG&E. But its tempting when its stock price is at levels we have not seen since 1999. And when debt restructuring + Foundry software could change the long term out look of the company. 

**The play?**

Bull case: Foundry significantly helps mitigate disasters and debt restructuring is approved quickly... **$17c Expiring December 17th**

Currently (Jan 29th, 2021) they are priced at $0.99. 

Greeks: Delta=.3209 Theta=-0.0034 Gamma=.0582

Has you used either of these before? If you have, what is your experience with either of these two companies? Everything from ease of use or UI to their customer service. Also do they come with fees or anything like that? All input is appreciated and it’s a shame that so many big brokers did dirty on their customers but it’s good that it shed light on who the real brokers should be.

Edit: It’s safe to say 90%+ of the commenters here argue that fidelity is the go to. A good portion of the fidelity backers say the only upgrade Fidelity really needs is to get a cleaner UI and it will be a go to platform for a lot of investors. A few people are commenting saying that we should rally and get a sub going to get Fidelity’s attention to reshape their UI.

I'm just a dumbass with some life experience to share.

**First, buy some goddamn personal umbrella insurance.** It's cheap af, like I pay $400 a year for mine. And it's easy af to buy. What is umbrella insurance? It's something poor people will never have to worry about, so be glad it's in your life now. **It protects you from lawsuits by parasites by adding million(s) of dollars in personal liability coverage above and beyond the policy limits of your auto, renters or homeowners insurance.**

Your shitty auto/renter/homeowners policies have limits of a couple hundred thousand bucks max. If you hit somebody's car, if someone slips and falls in your house, if someone accuses you of sexual assault, odds are there they will want to sue you. Any plaintiff's attorney worth half a fuck that they hire is going to do their research on you and when they do their DD and find out you have tons of assets now, they are going to come after way more than what they wanted thinking you were just some broke nobody. Umbrella insurance protects you from the unlikely but ever present threat of bankruptcy through lawsuits now that you are a big rich target. I've seen way too many idiot doctors and successful small business owners lose their life's work through negligence lawsuits and not having umbrella policies in place that would have stopped it.

Which brings me to my second request of you. Don't make yourself an obvious target. **Keep your goddamn mouth shut about your tendies and tell no one the particulars. Don't even fucking hint at it** (in real life that is, say whatever you want anonymously on WSB. Half my post history is about my net worth, ffs). Don't tell dad to make him proud, don't tell strangers to impress them and feel good, don't tell some girl to get her to fuck you. I don't care if you shower the people you love with gifts, it's none of my business. If they ask, just say you had a good year trading and leave it at that.

Neither of my parents know about my trading profits, nor that I'm a millionaire. None of my friends know. I'll go to my grave not telling a soul. Because I see how people treat the people I know IRL who do flaunt it and I'm disgusted how some people (not all) no longer view you as a person, just something to exploit.

**Why tf should you listen to me? Maybe you shouldn't. I was wrong af about GME.** I posted how I thought it was trash from $10 to $30 and while I thought u/DeepFuckingValue deserved props for eating shit all year and holding strong, I thought the rest of you were FOMO sheep chasing it in the $20s. Mea culpa. I'm glad I was wrong. I've never seen so many rattled old white men before in my life before this week and it's great. I'm genuinely happy for you guys that hit it big and hope the squeeze isn't over. Please consider what I've said. Thanks.

**(edit) Mods, it's okay to delete this repost if you deem it necessary. I'm honestly really disappointed that u/DeepFuckingValue was identified by the WSJ and other media outlets in the days since I first posted it. I was hoping he would stay anonymous and ride off into the sunset, but it's none of my business if he didn't want that for himself. Hoping others will see this and think about it before going public.**"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185634.csv|StockTicker|['I']|[]|['WSB', 'I', 'I', 'DD', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'IRL', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'FOMO', 'I', 'WSJ', 'I', 'I']|['DD', 'IRL', 'GME']

Full blown media attack to change public opinion (shitty practice). They drove the stock from $60s down to under $10. They made their money and thousands of employees were laid off. Today, the stock is over $100.

Edit 5: So, since people are reading (wut?), I figured I'd give some context about my sad miserable fucking life to maybe get you guys more JACKED TO THE TITS:

2 years ago I was hospitalized with the worst bout of depression. I never imagined how bad depression could be. I was weeping literally every day. Couldn't do shit but cry all the time and contemplate why I was even fucking here. I was going to school to get into a career that I didn't even want to be in, and I legitimately felt like I was a useless POS that was only a drain on everyone around me and they'd all be better off if I was gone. That depression took EVERYTHING from me.. my confidence, self-esteem, self-worth, humor, and much more. Now, I'm a garbage man in NJ with a fucking bachelor's degree and student loan debt and I live in a fucking doll house owned by my wife's grandparents, right next door to her nosy ass parents, cause we can't afford shit else. Thankfully her boyfriend chips in on rent so he has a discreet place to bang her whenever he wants. My life these past 2 years has been a slow climb out of the fucking abyss, and for the first time in 2 years, I have something that has me literally uncontrollably excited! I started trading a few months ago with everything I had saved up (not much). All ""smart"" investments with long-term growth almost guaranteed. Then, here you fucks come along with an idea for the heist of the century. I read the posts, saw the action, and said ""You son of a bitch, I'm in."" I sold almost all of my PUSSY stocks and stuck my dick in GME! THIS IS EVERYTHING I HAVE. IF A GARBAGE MAN CAN HOLD MONEY THAT WOULD PROVIDE A NICE COMFORTABLE CUSHION, SO CAN YOU!! 💎🙌🦍🍌 LET'S FUCKING DO THIS.. AGAIN NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE! I JUST LIKE THE STOCK 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Someone is stealing new Reddit accounts somehow and drumming up market sentiment around our beloved memestonks. We ordinary apes simply like these stonks, but whoever's doing this reddit account stealing has ulterior, possibly shady motives.

This particular instance, I have a theory that this was part of the propaganda campaign that was aiming to instill a sense of urgency and disappointment after the squeeze didn't happen this week. Notice how it says ""... this thing is happening in the next few days."" We all know it didn't happen, of course, but this comment was posted before a bunch of stonk apps removed the ability to buy memestonks, which led to a subsequent series of short ladder attacks drilling down the prices of our beloved memestonks.

I think this is another piece of the puzzle pointing to a very real possibility of an alleged concerted, co-operative operation by the hedge funds which are short GME in order to manipulate the memestonk price and drive it down to ""normal levels"" (fuck you Interactive Brokers you fucking pieces of shit). Hey SEC, if you're not all corrupt assholes like these online broker CEOs, look into this will ya please?

I don't think this is nefarious - I've seen this 404 error since at least November.**

**Update 2: Robinhood makes money LENDING OUT YOUR SHARES to shorts AND THEY KEEP THE INTEREST. if you switch to a Robinhood Cash account, they will be unable to lend out your shares.**

A ton of this sub uses Robinhood and after what happened the last few days, we all want to jump ship.

Not only did Robinhood restrict buying of GME, but since we are all on Margin Accounts, technically Robinhood owns the stock and simply passes many of the rights of ownership to us, crediting us with quasi-ownership.

This is important because if Robinhood fails, we don't actually own our stocks - Robinhood does and those shares we paid a lot for could just as well go bye-bye.

The obvious solution is to get the fuck off Robinhood, but it ain't that simple. If you begin a transfer of your assets to another brokerage, your positions will be frozen for up to 2 weeks. Every single day counts right now, and that is simply not an option.

As much as we shit on Robinhood, we really need to be rooting for them to succeed and get an influx of cash to be able to post it as collateral with DTCC to get our trading activity back to normal.

All that being said... there is an alternative solution to save our asses:

**Robinhood Cash Accounts**

[Details here - CLICK MEEEEE\~](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/)

In short, when you sign up for Robinhood you start off with a **Robinhood Instant** account. This is a margin account.

If you're like many of the retards on here, you upgraded it to a **Robinhood Gold** account. This is still a margin account.

There is a third option: a **Robinhood Cash** account. You do not get access to instant deposits. You do not get access to instant settlements. If you sell anything, you'd need to wait 2 trading days before having access to the cash. Essentially, you're no longer relying on the magic of margin accounts to make everything look instantaneous to you.

Does that suck? Yeah, kinda, but **you get full control and ownership of your shares**.

I will be downgrading my account to a Robinhood Cash Account and once this is all over, I'll be transferring to another brokerage."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185646.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'NDING', 'OUT', 'YOUR', 'HARES', 'AND', 'THEY', 'KEEP', 'THE', 'EREST', 'A', 'GME', 'DTCC', 'CLICK', 'I']|['GME']

Look. In 1999 mark cuban wanted to lock in his broadcast.com gains but held only yahoo stock he couldn’t sell for 3 years. So what he did was buy what’s called a collar which often costs little to nothing.  So if a monkkeee wanted to hold but didn’t want big loss they could theoretically take some lots of 100 and for each one they could sell a 2023 call and buy a 2023 put.  This locks all gains and you can hold theoretically forever by rolling, and essentially makes it where you only can get called away at say $400+.  

Does this make sense or am I missing something? This is legit just a question as I’m a  humble moron and don’t know anything so this is NOT financial advice. I’m literally just curious.

Downside maybe  is that call buyers of the calls you sell could then lock in at whatever the strike was preventing a big squeeze on price for them, but maybe upside makes it easy for people to keep holding. Maybe allows people to diversify without fear of losing it all

Can someone please clear this up for me?

 I know a lot of you fuckers are already in MAC and we can make another round of people rich. Note I have a $1k stock position in MAC, so this isn't a big money maker for me since I didn't buy call options -- but I'm going to... I just want to share what I've found and how I see things, so hopefully we can have another round of poors becoming wealthy during this fucked up pandemic.

Why I think MAC is such a hold position is because look at the short interest: https://imgur.com/a/YY9Ymku. It has been at or near 70% for a long time and the short interest is dropping (see graph on imgur slide). Why I think this is important is because MAC was trading around $6 a year ago. I think a lot of shorts are already trapped at the low prices -- probably shorts at really low prices that can't get out because the current price. (That's my logic at least, someone with more market knowledge please let me know if that's not the correct way to think about things.)

Also, I think MAC has been collecting rent and has good financials/cash (like GME), so it is undervalued. (Can someone grab a good article so we can lay out the value play on MAC?)

MACs market cap is a lot bigger (5x's) that of where Gamestop was at. I think this may make it harder to squeeze -- but someone with more knowledge can maybe chime in.

Thoughts and help appreciated. And, if I'm totally idiotic, you can tell me that too.

EDIT: One other thought -- MAC is a good short-term and long-term play. If you look at options, they're really cheap. Now go look at the 5 day chart -- see how the stock has been bouncing off $23? If you buy the cheapest February call options, I think you can easily make it to $23 -- and I think there's a possibility for a lot of $$$$$ to be had. I can't trade options right now because it's taking forever to get money into my trading account (oh, yeah, I never traded until GME and I've never traded options, so again, I'm a retard). But -- DFV made the majority of his money on calls so if one of you fuckers strike it rich on the option, at least leave me a thumbs up on here.

After Reagan declared war on family farms and kicked out agricultural subsidies and commodities purchasing by the USDA to support family farms, it took about a year before the Farm Crisis got into full swing. My Dad made the TV news when our family dairy was the first in Northern Minnesota to be put on the block by the FDIC as they liquidated our bank to “protect investors”.

My father began a process of making progressively more desperate bets in order to try to support his family, sold Shaklee, was in three or four multi-level marketing schemes, sold insurance, ran a saw mill, started a small handicap equipment manufacturing company, before throwing in the towel and accepting what money I and my brother could spare him from our student loans. When I joined the Navy in desperation (abandoning college), all their utilities were cut off and he had finally given in and accepted welfare and food stamps.

Over the years, he finally got a service connected disability (Vietnam), and after my mother passed, now lives, not comfortably, but adequately. His story is finally to its “happy ending”(?).
My road has been paved with extremely hard work, and I am doing okay, no thanks to the powers that be. Completed my service in 1992, did okay as a blue-, then white-collar person, until 2008...declared bankruptcy to save my family’s home, out the other side and finally, I think, going to make it. No retirement in our future; at least not yet; but we’re okay.

So, I hope you accept this disenfranchised Gen-Xer, and thanks for the welcome.

Good friend I am, I set some time aside to actually make a [legit quiz](https://quizbi.com/unit/lgd0el/unit-the-big-short-squeeze-from-5-to-50-could-gamestop-stock-gme-explode-higher-value-investing) so I can give him some feedback and help my fellow diamond hands at the same time.

I threw some curveballs in so if you get everything right then you know why you like this stock.

Engage diamond hands, keep up on DD, and don't blink because we're riding up this week.

Positions 46 shares of GME with another 2k in on Monday to btfd. Not even thinking about selling till we hit $10,000 because that's how much I like this stock.

I read WSB for like 12 hours a day and miss new posts all the time.

*Disclaimer: I'm a moron and not a financial expert, I own GME shares. This is all my opinion.*

Hello, my fellow retards. This GME movement has been seriously heartening for the common man, and the following that WSB has gained because of it is completely bonkers. This is all well and good, but on some level, GME is still a numbers game to me. Melvin announced that it had closed its position in GME and everyone here instantly doubted such a claim. I have some 8 pm coffee-fueled napkin math that suggests... maybe?

**Point 1:**

[Here](https://www.shortvolume.com/) is a website I've found very confirmation bias-y. It gives some ballpark numbers for short positions changed day by day. Over the last 10 days, we see a short volume of approximately 200m. That is a lot of changing shorts and give ample time for Melvin to have exited their short -at first glance at least. If we assume that every single one of those shorts was taking a new position as the price continued to rise over the last several days we see that from 1/22 through 1/26 there is approximately \~82m shorts changing hands in the sub $133 price range. Then, from 1/27 to 1/29 (after GME broke $300) there is \~34m short volume. If we assume that EVERY SINGLE SHORT got out, then bought back in as the price rose for the last \~80m volume (to ultimately bring us to the SI estimate today) the best price that the shorts could possibly be holding, on average, is about **$180 per short**. In other words, **shorts are still massively underwater even if they've been frantically covering and doubling down for the last week**.

**Point 2:**

CNBC could be lying.

**Point 3:**

[CNBC could be telling the truth.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/gamestop-short-sellers-are-still-not-surrendering-despite-nearly-20-billion-in-losses-this-year.html) This article mentions what a few experts (yes, Shkreli is an expert here) have said at this point: WATCH THE INTEREST RATE. If melvin exited their position as fast as they could, and there were not enough new shorts to pick up the slack, the interest rate would fall through the floor. I am taking this with a grain of salt considering that shorts have been doubling down throughout this month, but Melvin having probably the single largest short position on GME would definitely shake up the numbers. Edit: u/_UDW mentioned that [Ihor Dusaniwsky](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/gamestop-short-sellers-are-still-not-surrendering-despite-nearly-20-billion-in-losses-this-year.html?utm_content=Main&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook&fbclid=IwAR1DG7CAHua6XMuTf1zcioplEVRMnC-59LcNaiL-ck3qrklMsBDhtbfGytQ#Echobox=1611941927) also disagreed with the possible Melvin exit.

**Point 4, the Devils Advocate:**

Melvin, as per the CNBC article, completely exited its position on 1/26. That Tuesday was two things: the cleanest rising day we've had since $35, and some of the highest volume GME has ever seen. In my opinion, that rise could have been caused by constant buying pressure as Melvin unwinded their position, and there was definitely the volume to support that kind of a move without *completely* fucking the price.

**My conclusions:**

Melvin being out or not isn't a huge deal, but it does make the squeeze less sweet if they are gone. I am positive that a multibillion-dollar hedge fund would rather book a 30% year loss than a bankruptcy, and that they are at least hedging their position like a madman. However, at this point, someone is still holding a -100% bag at *least* and these new shorts entering GME, then leaving almost a day later with a complete loss will push some crazy momentum into the stock so long as it generally goes sideways or up.

TR;CR:

Melvin is probably lying but it doesn't matter, buy GME. \*rocket emoji\*"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185640.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['DD', 'I', 'WSB', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'WSB', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'EVERY', 'INGLE', 'SHORT', 'SI', 'CNBC', 'CNBC', 'WATCH', 'THE', 'EREST', 'RATE', 'I', 'GME', 'UDW', 'CNBC', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'GME']|['DD', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'RATE', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

He danced around the question of why he did this by alluding to how he wanted to protect investors. This is all a SHAM.

There is a significant chance that had they not halted trading on the relevant stocks, they would've been **insolvent** by close of trading, depending on the size of their credit line. **This is why they raised $1 billion as an emergency from investors**. The reason why he wasn't clear about this, was because if you admit on TV that your company is experiencing liquidity issues -- even if temporary in nature such as with clearing custodianship requirements -- you run the risk of triggering a greater panic through customer withdrawals/redemptions. You also run the risk of going insolvent. **It is no coincidence that they've been halting buying on literally any asset as soon as the volume on it starts to massively increase.**

This could turn into a run on the brokerage pretty quickly, and probably already has in some measure, especially after a day of massively lost customer trust. Vlad certainly didn't help it by going on TV and lying about their liquidity issues.

Probably the most important thing you can read regarding GME

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img qq1cm0figie61...*

Logically it made sense that Robinhood was running out of capitol, until you do the math and read the 2 articles posted today about these firms being unable to meet the cash requirements. 

**First we examine the brokerages finances**  
 

TD Ameritrade - (2019 Average - 860,000 Trades per day, 11 million accounts and **1 TRILLION in net assets held by clients**.

(Data limited no IPO) Robinhood - (2020, 13 million accounts, 4.3 million trades, $150 billion in transactions.

E-Trade - (2019 - **398.6 billion retail assets** \+ 365 billion corporate service assets, Morgan Stanley purchased E-Trade to have a combined **3.1 Trillion in Assets**, in addition Morgan Stanley had **38.947 Billion** in free cash flow for 2019. )

Charles Schwab - (2020 - **6.69 Trillion in client assets**, Averaged 8.191 MILLION trades per day. 

eToro - (2020 -1.5 Trillion trade value cleared in a year... or **4.109 Billion per day**. 17 million users.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Next lets examine GME volume**

&amp;#x200B;

On Monday and Tuesday (25/01/2021 (DD/MM/YYYY) was at 177 million @ $100 a share, 

91 Million Wednesday @ $350 a share, 

and finally 42 million on Thursday @ high of 470 and average at 240 .

This adds up to 17.7 billion traded value Monday and Tuesday

31.85 Billion traded value Wednesday

10.08 Billion Thursday

**(Stick with me here)**

Now remember these companies are used to trading $GME at an average volume of 40 million a day with a share price of $10 or a net total of 4 Billion traded value. So in your head take out 4 billion from each of the total traded value of the stock for each day, and that is the numbers we are working with. 

Now compare this to Tesla, This year they experienced an average volume of 34.76 million. However their volume changed from the lowest over the year at 17 million @ a share price of 417.13, compared to the highest on the year at 222.13 million shares traded @ a price of $695. Those two numbers add up to **7.091 billion on their lowest day and 154.38 billion on their highest.**

**Now remember how we just saw that on $GME highest daily traded volume ever recorded they barely touched a change in value of 32 billion??? Yet somehow we see eToro, Robinhood, Charles Schwab, E-Trade and TD Ameritrade all restrict $GME because as they claim, ""They ran out of money"" So they can front the cost of 154 billion in a day for trading 1 stock but can't cover the 32 billion on a different day for a stock that has significant impact on their relationship with one of their banks?**

Now you tell me? Were we seconds away from igniting the largest wealth transfer in history? Were we seconds away from giving money to people who will give back, those who can help the single mother or homeless man on the side of the road because they aren't a billionaire themselves they are just another human who lives in a neighborhood, who passes the homeless man, talks to the single mother, works 12 hour shifts. We were seconds away from a wealth transfer not to a billionaire who will write a 40 million check to a charity that takes 80% for ""Admin cost"" but to you, me and every other person who has the ability and desire to change the lives of those around them for the better not just through a smile as you walk by or a bummed cigarette late on a Friday night, but through a physical way that only wealth can distribute.

Keep your head up, The math on this is simple, they are playing you. 👐💎👐

You're doing something a lot of people in this world don't bother to, and seeing all of the posts of people paying off homes, cars, student loans, and so on melt my heart.

Before the GMREEEEEEEEs that have infiltrated every financial sub on the planet start shrieking about me insinuating you should cash out, *you make your own decisions on your own risk tolerance*. *You do what's best for you*.

Now, **when you do** **cash out of** ***any position,*** **give smart**. I've been in the nonprofit world for a while and can tell you there's a lot of ""charities"" out there that do fuck all with the money you give them or just let it sit in their account for the duration of the disaster that people were donating to alleviate (looking at you, Red Cross).

It makes me physically ill to think of your giving going to waste. I'm not going to tell you to give to the arts, or to medicine, or to space exploration. Just be sure to investigate where you're giving and don't trust the ""Top 10 charities for X"" posts you see all over the interwebs. I have provided for your sleuthing pleasure a few websites to vet your giving. They will allow you to search by name, type, etc. Give them a look and see.

[https://www.charitywatch.org](https://www.charitywatch.org/) \- Will tell you how the charity compensates their executives, their cost-to-raise ratio, and the program to overhead ratio.

[https://www.givewell.org](https://www.givewell.org/) \- Another organization that researches top charities to provide transparent data.

[https://www.charitynavigator.org/](https://www.charitynavigator.org/) \- Probably the most in-depth of the bunch on the ones that they review. They go into detail on the impact, results, accountability, and culture of whatever organization you look up.

Also, there's a boat load of foundations out there that would love to take your money and watch it grow. Many of them already have securities and other assets. *You can sometimes donate assets directly and the wealth keeps growing.* \*\*You can also bequeath another account to an organization.\*\*This means you don't touch it but name your charity as a beneficiary. Let it grow, then when you die, Tendie Claus will drop it in their chimney. For more information:

[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/donatestock.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/donatestock.asp)

Other points to consider: Cost-to-raise is not always a good measure, so do your DD on charities. For charities that have most or all of their capital and assets donated, the cost-to-raise should be exorbitantly low. Don't confuse PACs with charities. Here's an example: PACs donate to pro-X legislation and legislators. Charities donate their services, products, and education falling under the X rubric to people in need.

If you're more interested in activism and advocacy, you can find some great resources here:

[https://www.opensecrets.org/527s/types.php](https://www.opensecrets.org/527s/types.php) \- Watchdog for PACS[https://www.fec.gov/data/committees/?committee\_type=O](https://www.fec.gov/data/committees/?committee_type=O) \- List of Super-PACs

[https://www.fec.gov/data/committees/](https://www.fec.gov/data/committees/) \- List of hybrid PACs

My apologies to the Europoors. Can't help you because I'm a lowly American't.

Bless all you magnificent bastards who have already done God's work in sharing the wealth you've accumulated on your own volition.

Tl;dr: Use these resources to research companies before you consider donating.

Edit: There are some 3rd party services out there that help certain non-profit organizations (charities and companies alike) with what we call ""passive investment"" or ""passive activism."" Amazon Smile is a good example of this. A portion of your purchase goes to whatever 501c(3) company you select that's registered. But it's 🥜 compared to an actual gift.

Edit 2: Thank you u/onomoto81 for the link to a philanthropy podcast that discusses the considerations you should evaluate before giving ever and at all. I skimmed it and it seems on the up and up. Philosophical but at least worth the listen.

If the Borrow Fee is around 32.8% \[[3](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)\], then at the current stock price of $325 the short holders would be paying $18 million per day if they don't cover (.328\*$325\*61.78 million/365 = $18 million).  The cost to cover the shorts right now would be $20 billion ($325\*61.78 million).

Let's imagine a second scenario in which they wait and assume the stock price will slowly fall to $150 over the next year. In this scenario, they'd pay a total of $3.35 billion over the course of the year in Borrow Fees, and then cover their shorts for another $9.27 billion. That'd bring the total to $3.35+9.27 = $12.62 billion.  So they'd save $7.38 billion dollars.

Obviously this would be a bet by them that the price would fall, and if it doesn't they just wasted another $3.35 billion in paying a years worth of borrow fees. But is there anything to stop them from trying to go this route?

There are large banks currently naked shorting silver on the futures markets one of them is JP Morgan. It is essential to understand that there is an interest in suppressing the price of silver as every increase undermines the confidence in the U.S. Dollar. 

What is essential to know about SLV is the following: 

> The sponsor of the Trust is iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”), a Delaware limited liability company and an indirect subsidiary of
BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). The trustee of the Trust is The Bank of New York Mellon (the “Trustee”) and the custodian of the Trust is JPMorgan Chase
Bank N.A., London branch (the “Custodian”). The agreement between the Trust and the Custodian is governed by English law. The Trust does not have any
officers, directors or employees.

The same bank that is heavily shorting silver is the custodian of $SLV.  The last time someone tried to increase the price of silver the FED created a special rule to fuck them. The two speculators that tried and successfully (for a time) controlled the majority of silver were billionaires even before their action in the silver markets. After the intervention from the FED, they went broke, billionaires going broke isn't something you hear often. 

Be sure that you know what you are getting into and do not use money that you cannot afford to lose. If you think you can compete against the largest banks in the nation and the FED you are wrong. The price might go up for a time but the crash will be swift."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185640.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['SLV', 'JP', 'U', 'S', 'SLV', 'LLC', 'N', 'A', '$SLV', 'FED', 'FED', 'FED']|[]

He'll be around in the thread to answer questions

We are going to look at **Biocryst’s** recently approved drug **Berotralstat**, AKA **Orladeyo**. It is a **once-a-day pill** given to patients with a terrible lifelong disease called **Hereditary Angioedema**, that results in them having to **frequently visit the Emergency Room** for life-threatening angioedema attacks (check out Youtube for videos of HAE patients suffering from these attacks and using Berotralstat). It is estimated that this disease affects **1 in 50,000** people in the world, or roughly **140,000 people**, so although considered a rare disease, it is still affecting a **lot** of folks.

The available treatments for this disease are **all IV drugs** that are painful and produce local reactions. Berotralstat is the **first oral drug**. It achieved excellent results in phase 3 trials, and the US FDA gave it **fast track** status in 2018 and Japan gave it **Sakigake** status (type of fast track). Then **on December 3rd, the US granted approval for the drug**. They did it very importantly with **zero label** statements--meaning that they had no concerns about side effects or dangers. **On January 22nd, Japan granted approval**. The **EU** also met last week to discuss approval and will announce its result **this quarter**.

So let's look at what the above means for this stock. First the drug is in **HIGH** demand. In the US there are at least **10,000** people with HAE. Despite the disease being frequently debilitating, patients are so uncomfortable about getting regular injections that **only 7,500** are currently being treated with IV injections. The other 2,500 are going **untreated** despite the high risks. Now let's look at the 7,500 patients on a prophylactic treatment. Based on numerous surveys by doctors, the company, and researchers, most of these people would prefer an oral treatment. Take a look at this peer-reviewed survey article finding that [98% of IV prophylactic patients (the 7,500) would prefer an oral treatment and 96% of the non-prophylactic patients (the 2,500) would want an oral treatment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489436/).

No wonder then that one of the preeminent biotech analysts, Evercore's Liisa Bayko, wrote to her clients on December 4th that Berotralstat was likely to quickly **take at least 30% of the HAE market** based on Evercore surveys of patient and doctor demand.

Remember that this is **just the US**.... Japan did not even have any prophylactic treatment until Berotralstat was approved there a few days ago. They have **500 people registered with HAE** and estimated **2,000 ready to be registered**. [The UK is so desperate to add the drug for its patients, it did not even wait until the formal approval process to go through and gave early access to the drug on November 9th](https://angioedemanews.com/2020/11/09/berotralstat-available-to-eligible-patients-uk-through-early-access-program/#:~:text=Berotralstat%20%E2%80%94%20an%20oral%20therapy%20by,before%20its%20potential%20regulatory%20approval).

The EU is not far behind, with its estimated **20,000 patients**, with approval coming in the next few weeks. Then there is the rest of the world. The HAE patient population in **Latin America** is estimated by **HAE International**, the most important advocacy organization for HAE patients worldwide and one of **Berotralstat’s biggest supporters**, to be **over 15,000 patients**, the vast majority of whom are poorly diagnosed and not prophylactically treated. Argentina and Brazil have the highest actual diagnostic rates. HAEI through its Latin American sister organizations is strongly advocating for Berotralstat in Latin America.

Next, it should be noted that Biocryst built a **world-class sales team** for this drug in the US and EU and signed a **partnership with Torii in Japan** to take charge of the large sales and marketing promotion there. It has hired dozens of professionals, most from its HAE competitors. Its **vice-president** and US general manager **Allen Hodge** was even responsible for the **successful efforts of the HAE drug launches** of Cinryze and Firazyr, two pioneering injectable treatments for HAE. You could not get a more promising leader for this task.

It should also be pointed out that this drug, an oral kallikrein inhibitor, is potentially of **huge value for a host of diseases, including COVID-19** (that is now recognized to severely affect the kallikrein-kinin system, and kallikrein inhibitors have begun to be tested against COVID19--see this (IV) **kallikrein inhibitor trial that was just announced in Brazil** for instance: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/)), **diabetic macular edema** (which Biocryst just obtained a patent on a technique to administer kallikrein inhibitors for), many autoimmune diseases, and even some types of cancer.

Last but not least, how should this stock be valued based on this one drug? First, this drug is **one of the 10 most expensive drugs** (based on its annual cost of prescription) in the world, but still **less than the price of its IV competitors**, at $488,000 per patient per year. This drug is being approved by insurance companies **left, right, and center** as their preferred treatment, all you have to do is follow [R8](https://stocktwits.com/R8Plus) or [nickpd](https://stocktwits.com/nickpd) on Stocktwits to see how many insurance companies have been making it easy for patients to sign up for the drug. [Optime care even lets patients get direct-to-patient prescriptions now](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biocryst-scores-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-first-oral-option-to-prevent-hae-attacks).

So what does all this mean for sales? And why is the stock not valued based on just this drug alone (I will get to the others in **future posts**)? I **estimate conservatively** that by December 2021, there will be **over 6,000 patients on Berotralstat in the US, EU and Japan**, and I can share in a future post the graphs and calculations I made to get to those numbers. 6,000 patients annualized is up to **$2.9 billion in annual sales**. **Most** of this is going to be **profit**. At a **conservative price to sales ratio of 7**, that should produce a price of **$121, not $8.52**!  If you want to play around with the math yourself, look [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLvclUzTqCitwKfawL7kGCLquJxA2T7IJKLg52VWotE/edit?usp=sharing).

And that is **just the beginning**. Because Factor D and Galidesivir are going to be much bigger than Berotralstat for reasons I will explain in future posts. Remember that **its Factor D drug, which is showing superiority to all other anti-complement drugs in Phase I trials and was fast-tracked and given orphan status by the FDA and now is in Phase 2 though not officially announced by the company eyt,** and can be used in at least 20 diseases including common ones like Rheumatoid Arthritis, is currently **not even factoring into BCRX's valuation**. Consider that **Alexion with its significantly inferior anti-complement drug was just sold to Astra-Zeneca for $39 billion** because of the **recognized potential of anti-complement drugs** for a host of diseases. BCRX even has has **other drugs like Peramivir, already approved for Influenza and able to be used for the next bird flu pandemic, and its FOP drug--a story for another day**.

So why is this company, with **zero risk of dilution** due to an **amazing royalty deal** it signed in December and **three super-drugs** each worth tens of billions of dollars, and a host of other exciting developments to look forward to, **worth only $1.5 billion right now?** It can only be because the company's stock has been **relentlessly shorted in 2020 and 2021** to allow for significant accumulation by institutions. That is why the stock **only went up 168%**, yes ""***ONLY***"" **168%**...

The time for BCRX investors is **now**. My next post will be about Factor D, brace for that one. Factor D is 10 times bigger than Berotralstat! Good luck to all!

Which is a federal organization that insures your portfolio. UP TO $500k and a LIMIT OF $250k for cash. 

So don’t worry the $5 you got from your grandma is safe even if Robinhood goes down. Now if they do go down, which i doubt they will. Then after everything settles you should expect your money after a few months.

So its not lost. 

One thing to note is, if you own stocks on robinhood SPIC will pay the amount of the stock at the time of liquidation not when the broker goes down. 

So lets say RH goes down tomorrow and GME traded at $500. When SPIC starts to act and reimburse you for your shares they won’t give it to you at $500. They’ll return it to you at the current market price. 

There’s really no reason to panic, at least not yet. Robinhood may be shit broker but they are pretty successful.

Tl;DR: if we simply stay put we can guarantee the absolute best outcome for all. If we act selfishly we guarantee the worst outcome for all.


For those that have a pimple in their otherwise smooth brains:

The prisoners dillema suggests that people when confronted with the opportunity to cooperate to guarantee a good outcome for all will generally act selfishly and end up worse than if they had cooperated.

 However experiments show that humans are biased towards cooperation and will in real situations, more often than not, cooperate for a generally better outcome for all.

Point is, we have evolution on our side. Paperhanding is like snitching to get out ahead of your fellow retard. Hold the fucking line and DO NOT SELL! Buy more GME on Monday if you can and stick with it!

We can come out of this with wall street's money in our pockets!

Here’s why I support the $GME $BB $BBBY and $AMC movement.  


I am older than y’all my daughter is 42 - I know you don’t like us boomers just try to take a minute and hear me out.  


I want to see Citadel go down. Over the last year, my son in law was invested in a company called Chesapeake Energy. They declared bankruptcy in June 2020.  


About 6 months before they declared bankruptcy, Citadel worked with Chesapeake and their advisors to swap their Unsecured Bonds for new First Lien bonds against Chesapeake’s assets. All retail investors were shut out of this swap.  


So one day in January 2020 my son in law woke up and saw that ALL of his bonds - his entire life savings was now behind $4.5 billion in new SECURED debt. Before, they were all equal. Now if a bankruptcy occurred, my son in law was at the back of the line.  


This entire series of moves was engineered to exclude the retail investor. It protected institutions. They PURPOSELY EXCLUDED HIM AND OTHERS. They transferred his right to repayment to themselves.  


Before they declared Bankruptcy, Chesapeake negotiated privately with the new Secured Lenders to give them 96% of the new company’s stock and a 70% discount on new stock.  


My son in law’s life savings was reduced to 4 cents on the dollar while the institutions were able to get 130% of their money back.  


My son in law was very upset and tried to take a lot of pills on Christmas Eve.  


He’s okay now though thank God and the doctors.  


I gave him my $100,000 401(k) since I’ve got a pension plan from working for the power company climbing poles for 35 years. He didn’t have anything left. None of these companies give y’all kids anything.  


He’s trying to get back his life savings. He invested in the only thing he knows - he’s a petroleum engineer, so he bought $CVX, $OXY and $XOM. We’re hoping they recover so he can get his money back. Everybody thinks oil is evil but natural gas is the bridge from coal to wind and solar.  


What you kids are doing is incredible. I hope you make a difference. They don’t care about anybody else. Keep running up $GME $AMC $BB $BBBY $NOK - and cost them a lot of money!  


I know y’all don’t like us boomers but we love y’all kids. Don’t quit trying.

Here is how:

Here is likely the breakdown of outsiders thought of WSB (if they thought of us at all):

1. An average retail investor is conservative, buys ETFs, and doesn't trade with options or leverage. 
2. A $1m portfolio would rarely have more than $50k (5%) in any singular ""speculative"" stock. 
3. We had about 500,000 users, assume $10,000 per user. 
4. This gives WSB $5B in assets under management. 
5. If you assume the average retail investor only invests 5% into any singular play, this would give WSB $250m in buying power for any given play.
6. Assume a finite and largely fragmented ecosystem here where at most any play gathers 10% of our users behind it. 
7. This would make the total buying power of WSB on a single play roughly $25m. 

Assumed buying power: $25m, basically a small family office, not even a blip on the radar. 

Here is the rub. That math was completely broken:

1. YOLO: Our user base is willing to risk 10%, 20%, 50%, 100% of their portfolio on a single bet. Assume the average user will push 25% of their portfolio on a signal play. 
2. This immediately gives us 500% the buying power of average retail traders. We just went from $25m to $125m in buying power. 
3. We use options and leverage. Assume an average of 500% more blended leverage than the average retail investor (mainly based on options more than margins). This takes our buying power from $125m to $750m for a single bet. 
4. Growing Ecosystem: a strong play on WSB is/was not limited to our user base. More people outside of WSB joined in, growing our numbers from 500k to over 5m people. Assuming more fragmentation: a 5% engagement rate on a single play grows our potential dry powder for a single event to $3.75 Billion.

Even $3.75 Billion may be conservative with some institutional investors following WSB

TLDR outside investors likely thought our potential buying power was $25m, in reality, it was off by 15,000% and it was probably $3.75+ Billion"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185637.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['WSB', 'WSB', 'A', 'WSB', 'B', 'WSB', 'WSB', 'WSB', 'WSB', 'WSB', 'TLDR']|[]

It is the beggining of their end.

The implications of what is happening with GME go far beyond of what is happening with the stock price. So I want to give my point of view of what is happening and why GME investors are doing a favour not only to themselves, but to the whole world, and I am not exagerating.

# Wealthy investors do not need hedge funds anymore

The fact that hedge funds that ~~waste~~ expend billions a year have been beaten by a bunch of redditor trading from home in their pajamas pose an unconfortable question for them: why do wealthy people need hedge funds?

If hedge funds can be beaten so easily, why pay them outrageous fees? See GME investors have put in danger the whole hedge fund business model. That's why they are scared.

# Hedge funds went full retard

For the first time in life hedge funds are reacting to what retail is doing, they are not leading anymore. They decided to go full retard and short even more once the short squeeze started thinking they could easily beat retail, when the trade moved against them, they just cried and change the rules of the game.

The fact that they have lost several times and have no way out, is huge, because it means they cannot bring any value to their investors, again making their business model crumble.

# They have the weaker hand

They tried to use all kind of scary tactics (CNBC spreading misinformation about shorts, depicting wsb as a bunch of people gambling randomly, Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance and many more sites trying to prevent the short squeeze etc), they may have even commited fraud, collusion and market manipulation after what happened on Thursday and Friday. Yet GME investors held the line.

Why? Because they know hedge funds have the weak hand, everyday they are losing money on their shorts, paying interests, while investors just have to hold the stock. There is no hurry in selling, no pressure, and everyday new investors join the party pushing the price higher.

For how many days are they going to keep preventing people from buying?

# They cannot do anything

They may try to close this sub, but it is not possible. Why? Because it would be so obvious that they are doing it because they are losing money that Twitter and YouTube would burn and this would backfire up to the Government.

They may try to prevent retail traders from using leverage products, but that would drain liquidity of options and futures markets and cause potential capital flows into other markets (foreign equity markets, DeFi etc).

If they keep manipulating price and preventing retail from buying, the same applies, capital would flow to other markets so the whole US Financial industry would suffer.

TLDR: HOLD. If you like the stock better buy the stock than weekly calls.

Hedge funds are fucked.

When I found the channel I expected to find a total degenerate. I expected to see some tool sort of like u/WSBGod but with lucky real gains. I was super wrong.

What I found was an extremely smart, soft spoken, humble, and graceful individual.

He found true deep value in a stock and bet on it in a big way. Over the past several months he was welcoming people to challenge him. He was welcoming people to poke holes in his thesis. As GME grew and grew he meme-ed but never gloated. 

This GME situation has now exploded into something that no one (not even DFV) could have foreseen. I can't imagine what is going on for him and his family right now. 

He is a multi-millionaire. People here see him as a deity. Some people here are demanding he speak. Hedge funds probably want to see him ridiculously prosecuted somehow for his DD posts. Some people here are demanding that he announce his next play. I have even seen some people here make serious suggestion that he get into politics. 

I think everyone needs to have mad respect for this guy. With that respect we should all understand that what he decides he wants next for himself might not be what some of us envision. 

The world is honestly his oyster right now and he could go in any direction. Maybe he doesnt want to be in the public eye and wants to be left alone. Maybe he wants to be the next Burry with his own Scion Capital. Maybe he just wants things to stay the same as possible and just do youtube videos from his likely soon to be not rented basement. Whatever his choice is this entire community and the world in general needs to respect it. 

I also see people here writing ""If he is holding. I am holding."" This is fine but people need to understand that he likely will not tell us when he is selling (he shouldn't tell us for MANY reasons). In addition, we need to respect that he IS ALLOWED to sell if he decides to do so.

GME for many has become a venue to personally fuck the system down to your last dollar, but it may not be the same way for him. I personally am holding my position to the bitter end for that reason, but he may not. Others may not. DVF is at the core a true value investor. You will learn this if you watch his videos. Value investors do not buy and hold stocks. I am very interest to see how this ends for him. We all need to respect what one another does with their money. 

From the early days of this forum there have been some major wins that were phony as fuck. Nothing about DFV is phony. He is completely genuine. He is the real Wall Street Bets God.

His name is u/DeepFuckingValue. Let's put respect on that name for what he has done and continue to respect it when he decides how to end it. 

TLDR: In watching hours of DFV content there is no way that you cannot like this guy. He is very smart and very humble. We need to support him should he want privacy. We need to respect him should he exit his position."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185634.csv|StockTicker|['I']|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'MANY', 'IS', 'LOWED', 'GME', 'I', 'DVF', 'I', 'DFV', 'DFV']|['GME', 'GME', 'DD', 'GME']

I'm an eternally optimistic smooth brain, but countless and humbling failures from over confidence have taught me to be better at checking every blindspot. I've made one post about ways we could be left holding bags of GME already, but this scenario was overlooked. That combined with ADHD-fueled deep diving led me to SEC Rule 105. 

What is Rule 105? 

It says that greedy 🌈🐻 can't short 🍌 in order to try and drive down the price, and then buy 🍌 from 🦧 through a new offering to cover their short. 

If greedy 🌈🐻 violate it, they pretty much just pay a fine and there have been annual occurrences of violating Rule 105 since 2013. Bare with me, I'm going to try and do math. 

For example, [the hedge fund Millennium paid $638,709](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1DG30L) for 4 violations where 10,000 🍌 were shorted each. 

Using 40,000 total 🍌, that works out to a fine of $16 for each shorted 🍌. 

Although it's very hard to speculate the size of a possible Rule 105 fine for the GME 🌈🐻 shorts, let's guess based on this one example for the sake of overly simplified argument, because I don't think my brain (or yours) could possibly handle trying to make it more complicated. This also assumes GME is going to do an offering soon, will offer 58M 🍌 to cover 100% of the shorts, and sell them all to the shorts. I very much doubt that's realistic and GME wouldn't sell them to the 🌈🐻 that tried to make them go bankrupt, but what if it did happen? 

Greedy 🌈🐻 always pay less than the current price, so let's say they pay $150/🍌 to GME to close the shorts entirely:

$150 x 58M = $8,700,000,000 ($8.7B) to GME 

Now let's say they pay a fine of $16/🍌 to pay for their sins to the SEC:

$16 x 58M = $928,000,000 ($928M) to the SEC

$8.7B + $928M = $9.63B 

Less than $10B to get out of the mess they put themselves in. Given that the current risk for the 🌈🐻 is theoretically unlimited, why wouldn't they do it? 

As I said, I'm about as regarded as they come, this scenario is probably unrealistic and definitely over simplified, but is any of this an actual out for the 🌈🐻 that could result in all of us holding bags?

I've also yet to find a rule that says different 🌈🐻 that aren't short can't buy newly offered 🍌 from GME, and then sell them to the 🌈🐻 that need to cover their shorts. So maybe that's a possibility? 

TLDR: Given how unrealistic this seems and the fact there are also SEC rules against doing it, my final forecast for GME this week is 🎮🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. 🤲💎bois and girls because we like the stock and I'll see you in a galexy unknown.

It has me thinking, what could they possibly try to escape?

1.) Could they liquidate their assets into another company before the debt is due and shutdown capitol before the shorts are due? For example I heard that Toys R Us was robbed by these hedge funds and they forced the borrowed debt back into their hedge fund company. Could they possibly rush a huge debt of melvin and liquidate the debt into one company before the shorts are due? Seems super illegal but based on last week they seem to try anything.

2.) Can they keep affording to pay off the debt indefinitely through higher and higher premiums? I have diamond hands and can hold indefinitely but it got me wondering, if people keep purchasing the calls and push them into the debt contracts, although they run up in value can they just afford to sell new premiums that cover the original debt indefinitely? How are they even selling non-existent funds in the first place??? If that's possible couldn't they keep selling higher and higher amounts of non-existent funds to pay debts?

What else could you guys think of?

If short selling can technically result in an infinite loss, then why can a stock's ""value"" not also be infinite when short sellers get caught with their pants down?

I'm not sure what I wrote that's triggering it to get flagged... but here we go again. 

*I'm not a financial advisor, nor is this financial advice. This is my understanding and perception of PCG based on my experience and research. Go fuck yourself.*


**INTRO**  

Don't worry about jumping on this Monday, this will be a slow mover for a few weeks. Wait to cash out your GME positions after the squeeze climaxes into infinity! Then, put some of those profits aside into a safe 500% return from a utility company. It's always good to diversify.

**TL:DR** \- PCG is weighed down by liabilities from sparking a massive wild fire in 2018 that leveled a Nor Cal town in hours (billions in liabilities, over 100 dead). They are under massive public pressure and fear that another fire will spark due to their equipment coupled with drought conditions, price $55 -> $4 in weeks. Currently $11.40. SIGNED CONTRACT WITH PALANTIR! Going to be the safest utility in the state EOY. Half of the settlement to the fire victims were shares (pretty fk'd up, but it's something), let's make those shares worth $$$$$!

**Why PCG? (Pacific Gas and Electric  a.k.a  PG&E)**

PCG is one of the largest power companies in California, powering almost the entire northern half of the state. They have huge amounts of assets, land, equipment, etc that already justify the current price, but that's irrelevant because the company isn't going bankrupt. They had a MAJOR hit to the company in 2018. High winds and faulty electrical equipment lead to the most deadly wildfire in recent memory. The fire leveled a town within hours due to dry conditions and wind speed. PCG got blamed for the fire and strapped with billions in liabilities.   


Since the fire, PCG has revamped it's safety protocols to prevent future events. But, the last 2 year have shown (as a California resident, with PG&E power) that PCG is very inefficient. The first year (2019) was mostly a shotgun approach... if conditions were dry and an area had high winds, they cut power to EVERY-FUCKING-WHERE. It's a huge pain in the ass, but it's protecting theirs.   


This last year, it got better. I spoke with a few people that work for the city I live in, and they said that they had to contact PCG directly to let them know there was no fire danger within the city limits. So in 2020 during a big wind event, there were fewer, more selective areas turned off. Yay, they're learning... but way too f'king slow.   


**What does the company look like? Let's see the numbers.**  


I'll be honest, they aren't incredible. They are carrying a lot of debt due to burning down a town. But, that doesn't mean the profits are bad, and they are improving! Current revenue has increased year-over-year, while debt has been decreasing and looks to be fully paid off under CURRENT operating. That's not accounting for Palantir streamlining the f'k out of their operation.  


Here is the balance sheet (scroll down for the ""liabilities"" section to see debt): [Balance Sheet](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PCG/financials/annual/balance-sheet)  


All things considered, they are still looking like a solid company, just with a heafty bill due to a random event.   


**Accelerated recovery via PALANTIR!**

Two weeks ago, PCG announced a deal with Palantir to begin using their Foundry platform to help manage their power grid. This. is. HUGE. The biggest thing holding PCG back as a stock right now isn't it's balance sheet, it's the FEAR that another wildfire will come through and add another $10b debt to the company and drive them into bankruptcy.   


This is where Palantir's Foundry comes in. If you haven't had a chance to actually look at Palantir's software, check out the video from Demo Day 3-4 days ago. I tried to link it, but it keeps rejecting my post due to the YouTube link, so look for it on your own (fast forward to 8min for Foundry demo).  


Remember how I said that PCG had to contact the city officials in my local town directly to find out what areas were in danger during high-wind events? That information would be available to a single person, in real time, from every area connected to Palantir. Compiling information like wind speed, identifying damaged equipment, isolating at-risk areas, and making real time decisions. THIS WOULD SAVE PCG MILLIONS. Right now they have to send people out to inspect lines IN PERSON (this takes hundreds of employees HOURS to complete), and they have to call city officials in EVERY CITY and ask them ALL what areas should be blacked-out or kept on depending on risk. Can you imagine the cost of that man-power? The time involved? This took a YEAR to see improvement... But what if that COULD have been done in days, or hours???   


Palantir's Foundry has the ability to completely transform the safety of PCG. This will remove the ""fear"" of potential future fire event, since faulty lines, weather conditions, and overall communication between managers, techs, and field workers are all more connected, faster, and more accurate.   


**Potential**  


PCG's biggest problem has always been their ability to monitor their HUGE coverage area effectively. They are typically delayed to respond to problems, maintenance is usually only AFTER something goes wrong. Basically, the system is just too big and too antiquated.   


This is why the Palantir move is so major. PCG is the FIRST company to use Foundry. THE FUCKING FIRST. Any success from this is going to feed directly into the PLTR profit pool, because PCG becoming safe and efficient would be a GAME CHANGER. They have rode the ""we're you're only fucking choice, deal with it"" ticket too long, and after the 2018 disaster, it kicked them in the ass. This is their moment to actually pivot into a modern company. Value was $55 before the crash in 2018. It's worth at least that after Foundry gets rolling.   


**Final note**  


After the fires, half of the settlement to the fire victims were in shares. Fucking shares. Oh your house burned down? Our bad, here's part of the company... that's worth nothing now. FUCK YOU. I've been pissed the last 2 years about how the whole thing went down, but I get it, they can only do so much without going under in a situation like that. So, let's do our part. Let's push the price of the stock up enough that they can feel a little bit of comfort after losing everything. The company's worth more than it's valued, and far more with the adoption of Foundry. Let's send some tendies to the Paradise victims.   


**Positions**

500 shares PCG & 400 shares PLTR.

As we reach 7m+ Degenerates, there are more and more fud and ""the next whatever"" being touted around to DISTRACT us. There are more and more newly-minted-market-gurus-millionaires telling us Melvin's short position is going to squeeze on Monday Tuesday Thursday. Blah fucking blah.

There's CNBC, Reuters, and other tute-owned or influenced mouthpieces dedicating entire front pages  and taking out paid ads telling us boohoo, they fucking lost, we fucking won already, Melvin closed out, millenial-zoomers are fucking up your longs and the sky is falling. I hate the term ""fake news"" because how often it is wrongly used by the ignorant and because I fucking love the Associated Press, but this is fucking paid-for fake news.

IGNORE ALL THAT NOISE. REMEMBER the MARKET MECHANICS *WE* are EXPLOITING:

1. Hedgies borrowed SHARES of the stock and must return SHARES of the stock
2. The SHARES of the stock is LIMITED and they must BUY IT BACK on the open market when called by the lender
3. We are BUYING and fucking 💎🙌 HOLDING all those SHARES. HIGH demand, NO fucking supply. PRICE GOES HIGH since ALL YOUR SHARES ARE BELONG TO US.
4. We will DETERMINE the PRICE when THE SHORT SQUEEZE actually happens, the higher we can HOLD THE LAUNCHPAD FLOOR until then, the HIGHER the SQUEEZE. This is a WAR OF ATTRITION.
5. There IS NO TIME FRAME on WHEN THE SHORT SQUEEZE is going to happen. The lender has discretion on WHEN to call the loans and discretion to MODIFY or even FORGIVE the interest, but they NEED to call it EVENTUALLY. HOWEVER, we can see the trend of credible short data from [Ortex.com](https://Ortex.com), and [S3partners.com](https://S3partners.com), Ortex is affordable and has a free trial, S3's BlackApp less so, the data shows that short % of float is still HIGH for several names in play. This is not to say that the data is infallible or cannot be manipulated, but they provide a better metric than CNBC saying so-and-so closed all their positions and go home.
6. WHEN it happens, THE SHORT SQUEEZE will most likely look like a >**20""\* VERTICALLY ERECT GREEN PENIS** on your DAILY CHART (\*size variance based on the size of your screen) .
7. We are NOT the ones roiling the market-at-large. Our PLAYS are limited to a few TINY-ass names, the ENTIRETY (tens of billions?) of which being only a SMALL FRACTION of one single major SP500 company's market cap (1-2 trillion+).

REMEMBER, THEY EXECUTED a RISKY-AS-FUCK bet with theoretically **INFINITE**  ♾️ downside (only theoretically if we bought all the shares and set our prices at infinity, i.e. never sell). This puts your weekly FDs of OTM calls to SHAME!!! You can't lose more than the cash you put in, but they can lose their EVERYTHING and then some, and they knowingly went into this. This is NOT our fault, we are NOT doing anything wrong. Our plays are PROVIDING A CHECK AND BALANCE to UNCHECKED hedgefund fuckers that have been fucking us and the companies we love up the ass for DECADES, often ILLEGALLY -- NAKED SHORTS OVER 140% FLOAT (short selling with IMAGINARY shares) -- What in the literal fuck?.

As for various market selloffs last week, they could be folks taking profits after a record year, they could be scared folks who don't understand the situation, they could have just wanted another box of fleshlights, and/or they could also be the hedgies dumping and leveraging their longs to double down, triple down, quadruple down, because they think they can, or they have no choice, but to TRY to OUTLAST US. If they are already going to lose EVERYTHING (by covering at current prices), then what's another few fucking billion to push down the price and hope that a bunch of autistic plebs give up, get bored, or get DISTRACTED? We can't prove this, but their actions, PAID ads, and shill mouthpieces, all speak volumes.

Billionaire fund managers are stubborn, why would they openly admit to loss to a bunch of retards on Reddit if there was nothing to gain? To them, a bigger fund amount is just a new high score. Their lives don't change, they might buy another yacht. So ask yourself, would a monarch of yore, decked in all their splendor and glory, yield to a mere peasant? No.

Most of us are just common plebs working the daily grind, many of us don't even have the daily grind right now due to the pandemic. Our war chests are meager, but combined, together, we have a CHANCE. Billionaire Nick Hanauer wrote an article to his fellow billionaires that [THE PITCHFORKS ARE COMING](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/the-pitchforks-are-coming-for-us-plutocrats-108014), well this is what that looks like in the market, our shares are our pitchforks, we are not breaking the law, we are not invading your homes, we are not beheading the aristocracy. We are just giving you a taste of your own medicine and playing by the rules of a FREE MARKET in a government that protects FREE SPEECH.

Do NOT let them distract you! Do not feel bad about what we are doing or the dollar amount in your brokerage account. For once we are playing THEIR game and have a chance of actually winning.

First, I want to thank DFV u/deepfuckingvalue for showing me the way and leading us to the next galaxy!  **🚀🚀🚀...💎✋only** 

My main thought is this, don't become like the billionaires and multimillionaires of this country and be passive in the community and hoard our money like we're some kinda greedy dragons.

I grew up poor, very poor. So poor that when I was a kid my mom cleaned hotels and got to stay in one because we were homeless when I was 4. I had to survive eating butter, straight butter, for a week, when we ran out of food when I was 13. I've had fears of becoming homeless since then.

One day I was hit head on by a semi truck. I died for a few minutes on the operating table. I got a settlement, started to invest, and made it to $700K in 1 year with a $100K nut. I know, that's nothing like DFV, and I'm nothing compared to him. Because I lost it all.

I was almost a millionaire at 24, but I lost it all by buying down and panic selling later. Remember this next week, Don't Panic. Stay calm. Enjoy the ride. We will see a huge dip come Monday. That's when we ride! Buy the dip, and HOLD!

So back to my main point. Doing kind things to random people who are strangers and friends. That's my goal, besides strong personal financial security. But I don't need to make more than $100K a year to live a great life. I don't. But that doesn't mean I don't want to make millions. Mainly, I would love to make millions like DFV so I could do random acts of kindness and be active about it. Not leave it up to some bullshit charity. I don't know about you guys, but regardless of how big you make it, I hope you consider not become like these selfish billionaires who are hoarding money like it will buy them a golden ticket into heaven.

Unless... That's how it works and nobody has told us?

Kodak originally skyrocketed when news of a government $765m loan was announced to kick start them into becoming a pharmaceutical company during the midst of the pandemic. Yes, yes, I know.. Kodak seems like the company trying to jump on the bandwagon.. a cryptocurrency in 2017, and now pharma in 2020? Anyway, it retraced most of its gains when the SEC opened up an investigation on wrongdoing related to expected insider trading.  

 \-About a month and a half ago, the conclusion was made that there was no wrongdoing related to insider trading, the loan, etc. Now, that doesn’t mean it will still go through, but it certainly doesn’t mean it won’t. Kodak has made several announcements they will be getting into Pharma whether or not the loan goes through. With covid still looming, I don’t see what would have changed regarding the loan and with the original announcement being mid last year, an update MUST be coming regarding Kodak & pharma. 

 \-The market cap is only 700 million dollars. (Micro cap) This is minuscule, it’s less than the amount of money the government was going to give them, and is why Kodak went up so much when it was announced -Its literally more than the company was even worth! Market cap is important because it means Kodak has the potential to increase heavily over its current share price of \~$9.60. The higher the market cap, the more money required for a stock price to increase. For example, People are buying Nokia which already has a 30 billion market cap- that’s not going anywhere significant with nothing significant happening presently. 

 \-Relatively high short interest of 25.5% as of last week. This could spark a huge run. If price gets out of control, it would force shorts to cover. It’s obviously not one of the very top shorted companies, but it’s up there and with explosive price action Kodak is known to have, shorts seem to probably expect this by now. Once it breaks the current resistance it may fly catching the shorts off guard. 

 \-Huge bullish flag/pennant technical setup is primed to breakout. Check the longer term chart.  🚀 🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀

Media and the Reddit hivemind created this whole narrative that Reddit is responsible for squeezing Citadel and co when in reality WSB is just a pawn for the other hedge funds to kill Citadel. Everyone is out here playing 4D chess, look how much profit some of these hedge funds made going long on Gamestop while killing their rival, Citadel.

&#x200B;

There are  3 outcomes from this mess:

1. Citadel and co gets a slap on the wrist and nothing happens. (highly doubt this will happen due to the major media coverage on this and the whole narrative on how this is a ""david vs goliath story"")
2. Citadel and co goes bankrupt and fucked in the ass by SEC. If and when Citadel goes bankrupt, all the brokers are now liable to pay the winners, then the banks are liable, and so on... This will have a domino effect on the broader market, considering Citadel is quite big. This is literally a ticking time bomb waiting to explode, just look at the current VIX. (probably might happen if no one bails them out)
3. The rival hedge funds that are long on Gamestop takes profit and flash crash GME so that Citadel can get out of their short while everyone wearing a suit and tie makes profit off this. (highly doubt this will happen, this would actually the biggest 5D chess move)

&#x200B;

VIX also popped up on Wednesday in response to the whole Gamestop thing. This could very well be the catalyst that kills the bubble when this is all over.

Little reviews and where we stand (from my dumbass understanding).

Robinhood(RH) - Fuck these guys

[Cash APP](https://cash.app/app/XHBWJGN) \- Super quick and easy to use. It just pulls from your bank, don't really need to deposit and wait so its fast. Limited in what you can do. Can really just sell and buy at market price.

[Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/corporate-portal/)\- From my understanding they are on our side. Full fledged platform.

[WeBull](https://www.webull.com/activity/get-free-stocks?source=google-search-pc-pp-gw&gclid=CjwKCAiApNSABhAlEiwANuR9YMhAqzb9WMrlbqzVU4sjtV62BgfMOgesQOmMBXwDc2d0AvAkPIBodxoC0iYQAvD_BwE) \- not exactly not evil, not exactly a saint. However, pretty easy to use and teeter towards the side of us monkieees.

[Etrade](https://us.etrade.com/home/welcome-back)\- I used this in the past. Old looking. Not too hard to figure out. Pretty sure they blocked some trades. Might fuck em.

[TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/home.page) \- From my understanding, they are also on the side of the retard because they invested like a retard themselves.

I think the quickest two to get approved and start trading are CASHAPP and WEBULL. However, they all give their own bonusses for signing up and shit.

Fell free to add to this list and I will edit the post as information arises - If you apply now then by mid week all the newcomers can help us hold the line or invest whatever they think is dope - this is by no means investing advice. I am fucking stupid at this shit. 

(Only referral link is in Cashapp. we might both just get $5 or some shit. It is the best they offer for signing up and doing some shit)"|2021-01-30 19:42:03.125972|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_194204.csv|StockTicker|['TONKS']|[]|['I', 'TD', 'I', 'SHAPP', 'EBULL', 'I', 'I']|[]

**(here is how you know it is bad: when the front page of fucking imgur is reposting from WSB talking about how evil the stock market is)**

Here is all you are doing by continuing to double down on stuff like this and 'diamond handing'. You are buying someone else's risk and letting them cash out and go home. You are being left with the bag and when GME and all the other memes collapse you will wonder what you did wrong. If you want to buy my stock at exuberant prices under the guise of being a social activist, ill gladly offload my risk to you and walk away and I am sure every other bank and hedge fund is gladly doing it to. GME could gap up another thousand and I will still say the people buying are idiots for the same reasons above. 

If you are going to trade the memes, don't do it under the pretense of a social agenda. Do it because you are that autist who thinks he can make loads of money quickly, ultimately failing, and collecting your mod-ship like so many before you.

We're ""blowing up a bubble"" that will lead to a market crash. ""So many people are going to be left holding the bag.""

I guess none of this applied in 2007-2009 when millions of Americans were left holding the bag that Wall Street left them after gambling with synthetic securities and then taking those synthetic securities and packaging them into NEW synthetic securities ad infinitum until the entire financial system was quite literally about to disintegrate.

I guess none of that applies to the entirety of 2020 either. I guess the Fed literally printing infinite money taking the stock market to all time highs as we are in the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression has not contributed to a bubble whatsoever. I guess Jeff Bezos truly deserves to have 200 billion dollars as tens of millions of Americans can't pay rent or feed their families. After all, the market is forward thinking! All of this is completely natural.

But uh oh! It seems as though CNBC has finally found the true culprit for the impending financial crisis! It's those gosh darn redditors! Through complex market manipulation (aka ""buying a stock"") we are now responsible for whatever is to come next. We are solely responsible for the economic hardship brought on by a stock market crash.

It's not the multi-billion dollar hedge funds and investment banks illegally gambling with synthetic securities. It's not because a stock can somehow be shorted around to the point that it has more shares shorted than outstanding. It's not because if one fucking hedge fund loses solvency then somehow the entire market crashes. It's not because these mega-billionaires are so overleveraged that one measly short squeeze can cause a financial collapse.

No, it's because of the fucking redditors."|2021-01-30 20:19:43.434615|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_201944.csv|StockTicker|['ESTOP', 'HANGE', 'THE', 'CKING']|[]|['I', 'NEW', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'CNBC']|[]

I was wondering if someone in here who is smarter than me can provide an actual TA or DD of the situation with a realistic dollar amount for the peak, how long it may be that high, when it might moon, etc. 

I get that this is a casino. I get that it's a bet not a science. I get that even talking about selling is unacceptable rn. But we've all been seeing what our guys do when they get profits. They give to hospitals and charities. They pay of debts and tuition. They buy PC's for little brothers, cars for moms, houses for their families, etc. Money in our hands will do more for our communities and our countries than it ever will sitting in Melvins account.

Idk if you all have felt the same vibe I have been getting from people, but many people have been saying that this run-up is:

 ""unsustainable;"" ""GME is going to Crash Hard;"" and **my most favorite ""IT'S A FUCKING BUBBLE""** 

WELL, MY ANSWER TO ALL THE FRINGES OUT THERE IS TO **PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS!** Take a look at the option chain I provided below: 

   

[GME 3year LEAPs ](https://preview.redd.it/om5j2jtqjke61.png?width=1461&format=png&auto=webp&s=63b9c9dfbf7f8a666f27e558de4a9981bb7ffa78)

As you can see here, the bid-ask spread is trading fairly within a \~$15 range with bids ranging from $191 to $175 **on a fucking 3year contract!** I's say that is highly significant given the fact that these Financial Institutions were literally betting GME would go to ZERO like yesterday. As you can see by simply looking at the contact pricing, it is trading as if it's here to stay for the foreseeable future. 

**So, if there is anyone doubting your assumptions and namesake, simply tell them ""well there's a shit-ton of money to be made betting against me.""**  By selling the Calls anywhere from about the 350 strikes to about the 400 strikes, they could collect upwards of $1800 per 1 lot. Anyways, there is serious money to be made. Yet, it would be so satisfying to see the contrarians be left forced to buy shares of a company that believed it had the same worth as the lady who gives blowies behind the Wendy's dumpster. 

**TL/DR:** GME 3year LEAPs have some sick premium, so tell whoever is gay to go sell Calls and watch them burn.

What I found is actually super interesting, to me anyways. But dont forget, past performance does not equal future performance and this is all just speculative, but then again banks and people do have patterns, so if it is as highly manipulated as they say it is, maybe this is something. Anyways heres my retard document I spent far too long on.

https://imgur.com/gallery/gA6gbZP

So bassically we have a batman pattern in 2008 and were curently on the right ear of a batman patern right now. Whats interesting is the VW infinity squeeze happened in October 08, just to the right of batmans ear. We are currently in the middle of a GME infinity squeeze, and are currently, on batmans right ear. The difference is what side of batman the crashes are, in 2008 the crash is to the right of batman, in 2020 the crash is to the left of batman. So that kills the pattern right? Wrong, in 2008 The fed didnt start the quantiative easing until 3 months after lehman brothers went bankrupt and the worst that could happen, happenned. In 2020 the fed Started QE as soon as possible, thus the reversed sides of batman make complete sense.

With all this said, this could mean that SLV will finish it's batman ear and the gme squeeze will crash SLV and then a recovery to ATH, it could mean that because of the reversed crash patterns SLV will start climbing to ATH without finishing batmans ear, or, the most likely scenario, this means absolutely nothing and I just wasted a couple hours of my weekend."|2021-01-30 20:52:05.846763|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_205206.csv|StockTicker|['SLV']|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'ZP', 'VW', 'GME', 'QE', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'ATH', 'SLV', 'ATH', 'I']|['GME']

In 2021, u/deepfuckingvalue and u/Jeffamazon, lead the charge against some of the largest Hedge Funds in the US financial system, including Citadel and Robinhood, trying to infiltrate and destroy the most retarded short position in US finance history.  


Did you know, you would be paying back Americans and retards across the world for what happened to them, their families, and their girlfriend’s boyfriends during the 2008 financial crisis.  


We can’t thank you enough.  


Now some context:  


From February 2006 through January 2014, Bernake was Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, having been appointed to that position by both Presidents Bush and Obama. Before his appointment as chairman, Dr. Bernanke was chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, from June 2005 to January 2006. He was a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from 2002 to 2005.  


Bernanke then served as chairman of President George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisors before President Bush nominated him to succeed Alan Greenspan as chairman of the United States Federal Reserve. His first term began February 1, 2006. Bernanke was confirmed for a second term as chairman on January 28, 2010, after being renominated by President Barack Obama.  


Bernanke has been subjected to criticism concerning the 2008 financial crisis. According to The New York Times, Bernanke ""has been attacked for failing to foresee the financial crisis, for bailing out Wall Street, and, most recently, for injecting an additional $600 billion into the banking system to give the slow recovery a boost.""  


Bernake has also been criticized for his actions in the merging of Merrill Lynch and Bank of America.  In a 2009 letter to Congress, Andrew Cuomo mentioned Bernake along with former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in allegations of fraud concerning the acquisition of Merrill Lynch by BoA. The letter alleged that the extent of the losses at Merrill Lynch were not disclosed to Bank of America by Bernanke and Paulson.  


When Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis informed Paulson that Bank of America was exiting the merger by invoking the ""Materially Adverse Change"" (MAC) clause, Paulson immediately called Lewis to a meeting in Washington. At the meeting, which allegedly took place on December 21, 2008, Paulson told Lewis that he and the board would be replaced if they invoked the MAC clause and additionally not to reveal the extent of the losses to shareholders. Paulson stated to Cuomo's office that he was directed by Bernanke to threaten Lewis in this manner.  


To wrap everything up, I could write a well thought out conclusion tying Bernake to fraud and being a co-conspirator in the Robinhood/Citadel liquidity crisis but if you can’t connect the dots fuck you because you should’ve stopped your uncle from reading this to you 15 minutes ago.

On Thursday, when all the Robinhood chaos unfolded and the price artificially plummeted, I saw the opportunity to jump in and picked up a single, Feb 19th $320 call.

**Come Monday, I'm prepared to buy up to $100k+ worth of stock and/or options.** However, I first want to explore a couple of various scenarios that we may see play out and think through the potential effects with you guys ... no matter how unlikely they are. I'll try to be succinct.

# Scenario 1: issuance of new blocks of stock at ~market value

If I'm not mistaken, Q1 for Gamestop begins Feb 1. Say they want to capitalize on everything by essentially, sending a bailout package to hedge funds - the very ones responsible for shorting them in the first place. This would be in an effort to shore up their finances and provide them enough capital to easily explore ways to adapt their business. Likely, this would come with strings attached. e.g. Hedge funds receiving new shares cannot sell for n years.

**Potential Outcomes:**

1. HFs close out their short positions and short interest plummets. No more squeeze looks promising because the only shorts remaining would be those which shorted in the $300+ range. 💎🙌 don't have a strong incentive to hold, nor try to compete against these remaining shorts. Retail selling begins.
2. ?

# Scenario 2: short interest isn't all telling

We are all aware that short interest is extremely high - quite likely still over 100%. However, with the recent blast of all media coverage from *reputable* networks, all are claiming Melvin, Citron, and Muddy Waters have all closed their short positions. I find this hard to believe and suspect. Sounds like a shitty PR campaign and obvious plea/attempt to instill fear.

Let's just assume that these reports are true. We can then infer that this extremely high short interest is more likely held near the $77, $160, $380 - $483 levels (just taking daily highs).

If that's the case, for the sake of argument, let's assume the $77 shorts have closed their positions - helping drive the price up to the next levels.

**Potential Impact:**

1. Short interest remains extremely high, but the current market value ($325) is not enough pressure to initiate a squeeze - assuming these firms have enough capital to not be in danger of a margin call. Or, perhaps those that are in trouble, have decided to sell off other positions in the market to remain in good standing - hence the overall market decline this week.
2. ?

**Potential Outcomes:**

1. &#x200B;
   1. 💎🙌stay impenetrable. However, it becomes an extremely long dragged out war until they get tired of paying the short interest fees which are insanely high - especially for new shorts.
   2. 💎🙌 turn paper. Without deep pockets, we would need continued institutional longs to help push this into a squeeze.

&#x200B;

There are plenty of wholes in each scenario on why it's so unlikely or not possible. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this as well.

l93dum||Days ago, Robinhood had the potential to be a major brokerage and a top IPO. Now there's a significant chance they won't survive|t3_l93dum|0.95|34|34|new|2021-01-31 06:27:41.000000|Fargraven|12|News|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l93dum/days_ago_robinhood_had_the_potential_to_be_a/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l93dum/days_ago_robinhood_had_the_potential_to_be_a/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l93dum/days_ago_robinhood_had_the_potential_to_be_a/|"Bringing **millions** of new agents into the market, disrupting the whole industry with commission-free trading, an intuitive and user-friendly UI that any ape like us can understand, becoming the #1 downloaded app across most app stores...

Without Robinhood, this whole thing probably wouldn't have happened and WSB would likely be stuck at 100k subscribers like it was 3-4 years ago. Because lets face it, a hugee percent of WSB use(d) Robintard because we're too low-functioning to use brokerages that use >4 syllable phrases like ""money market fund"" or ""moving average""

Something like this happening right before going public was **GOLDEN** for them. All they had to do was not be a corrupt sellout bitch, keep their huge influx of new users happy, and they would've been set to come out of this a more respectable, even larger brokerage, as well as a high-value public company.

Instead they decided to expose the raw underbelly of their shitty business model and go exactly against their entire mission statement. Even if capital/margin requirements was the reason for the restrictions (it was definitely a factor but protip: it wasn't the full story), it doesn't change anything about the end result. Who the fuck wants to use a BROKErage who can't guarantee functionality during historical black swan events that usually result in the largest transfer of money? And then, **even if** they can't maintain capital requirements to execute trades, they could have handled it better. Just fucking pull the money from somewhere. Take out a huge loan from somebody ASAP. You can always get instant money if you don't give a fuck about interest rates, which they shouldn't because it's short-term and like I said, it would've been **HUGE** for the future of the company. Another one, they could have restricted both buying & selling of the trending tickers, or just go down altogether (RH users are very familiar with the app being down and losing full functionality, why is this time any different?). Yeah it would've sucked but at least it would've fucking stayed consistent with their mission statement of fair, democratic trading for all. I fuckin work at Wendy's and I can still imagine several better alternatives than the BS ""difficult solution"" they did.

And speaking of their mission statement, it's complete BS. It's just a sugarcoated way of saying ""lol we allow poor people to trade and have pretty colors"". They clearly don't give a shit about DeMoCrAtIzInG tRaDiNg FoR aLl. Because if they did, their business model wouldn't have been a Wall Street megacorp keeping the lights on by frontrunning user trade data.

And yeah another reason why ""volatiilty"" and ""trade volume"" excuses are BS is because they **increased** restrictions on Friday when both volume and negativity **decreased** lmfao. Screw this POS sham company.
