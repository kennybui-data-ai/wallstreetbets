&#x200B;

**The Mother of All Short Squeezes**

Volkswagen is often referred to as the ""mother of all short squeezes."" This short squeeze temporarily gave Volkswagen the largest market capitalization of any company in the world in 2008, when it quadruled in size over a few days (400% gain):

https://preview.redd.it/ibsya8j7qi861.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f7d6df799e607c9d33c18fc6d02c366eaf5d37c

Many hedge funds were short Volkswagen, and were caught off guard when Porsche announced that it had effectively gained control of 74% of Volkswagen's voting shares. There was a very short supply of Volkswagen shares with which to cover short positions with, leading the stock to soar as hedge funds desperately tried to cover their positions.

The unexpected news, combined with a very small float (= tradable shares) and large number of short positions, conspired to drive the shares through the roof. Some hedge funds are reported to have lost billions as a result of the squeeze.  

To put this in numbers: 1m shares were traded daily on average before the squeeze, and the available float was 135m shares at the time. This meant when funds came to buy back their shorts, sellers could charge a premium as there were so few willing to sell, driving the price up. It would take on average, 1/3 of a year for the whole float to change hands!

So the main point here is that a limited supply of shares is crucial for a true **short squeeze**. 

&#x200B;

**So does this apply to GME?**

There are 60m total shares available in the float for GameStop. The average daily trading volume for GME is **15m shares**. That means the entire float is traded in 4 days, basically weekly! This incredible amount of liquidity means supply is never a problem.

If funds had to buy back in to close their short position, they could, and the price would barely move. They would not have a hard time covering their position, and could buy back in without anyone ever noticing (until the next bi-weekly short interest report is released, which by then would be too late).

Just yesterday on a slow day 6m shares were traded (1/10 available), with less than 1% change in the price. Also this translates to $115 million exchanging hands, in one day. This kind of money isn't retail, it'll be market makers and funds who know all this information and more.

Whilst it's true the short interest is high for GME, around 50%-100% (over 10% is considered substantial), the fact that supply is not an issue, means the risk for these funds has not increased substantially. And it's all about the risk/reward in this game.

&#x200B;

And so for that reason you autists, I'm afraid the impeding short squeeze is just a myth.

One is for you to understand what Salesforce and SAP really do instead of just ""cloud"" and ""software"" and why Salesforce will become like SAP. The second is to tell you what to expect with CRM price and how to make tendies.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First you gotta understand what exactly SAP does and what happened with their stock. SAP is one of the largest software companies which focus on ERP. What the fuck is ERP you might ask? ERP is what other businesses use to track business resources. This ranges from everything such as planning and optimizing manufacturing capacity to dealing with payroll for employees. Basically companies don't want to create their own software for handling these wide range of tasks and pay SAP a shit load of money to do it for them. Where's the problem you might ask? Unless you are involved with one of these companies that use SAP, it's difficult to understand what the experience is like.

&#x200B;

[https://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=db3b665c95ce5d62639a4dc0e5d9469a08510cbd](https://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=db3b665c95ce5d62639a4dc0e5d9469a08510cbd)

Basically a company pays SAP to use their software for dealing with one of these areas of ERP. This generally works fine since SAP has used their business management software with a lot of companies for the same tasks. The issue is when one of these companies want to [customize the software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning#Disadvantages) to meet unique demands for the company. This re-engineering process to fit the ERP system for many tasks ends up costing more for a company and wasting a lot of time and money. Interestingly enough, you can ask almost any business about their experience with SAP and they will all say that they're unhappy even though they use their software. So what you might ask, wouldn't SAP still be generating tons of revenue? Well yes but more of these companies are moving away from this way of doing ERP as it is an inflexible approach. This is becoming replaced by more loosely connected systems utilizing cloud instead of having a one solves all solution.

&#x200B;

[https://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=c45c19bcdd0e10bd643286730aa3a2beeec0ae20](https://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=c45c19bcdd0e10bd643286730aa3a2beeec0ae20)

Let's look at how their financial earnings and stock price have reflected this. In the past two years this stock has traded relatively sideways with some really bad drops. Around May to August their stock price went up 60% do to the hype around cloud companies benefiting from COVID. However it has obviously taken a really bad fall when October earnings were announced. They claimed that there was slower recovery than anticipated for many of its clients. However I suspect that many of these companies have been looking to shift away from SAP as the pandemic has shown the importance of the flexibility of these systems. By looking at their past quarters, you can see that their quarterly revenue has been flat around the 8 billion range and the company is clearly having a difficult time changing their business model. Other cloud companies are replacing their solutions as SAP's clients move away from their software even though SAP is trying to shift to [modern cloud technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP#Corporate_restructuring). Generally though companies have a hard time changing their business approach from the old way of doing things to the new way of doing things.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now the important part. What the fuck does SAP's troubles have to do with Salesforce. As you may have guessed from the ticker Salesforce provides CRM or customer relationship management. [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) is a specific area in ERP dealing with customer services. For example a company may want a software for their call center or to automate a marketing effort. Salesforce provides software to do this along with analytics of this data so that these businesses can make informed decisions.

As you may have already guessed Salesforce is facing some similar problems that SAP deal with. When a company decides to expand their CRM software to deal with more parts of their business, the inflexibility and costs quickly become apparent. [For example, many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial basis and less than 40 percent of companies have high end-user adoption rates.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management#Criticism) Again if you are not familiar with software development and companies using these software vendors it is difficult to fully understand these troubles. I would strongly recommend researching the issues of customizing ERP or CRM software for a specific company if you are not convinced. While Salesforce tries to provide an all in one solution for their clients, customization becomes complicated and prices become costly. These customizations become difficult to do and take a lot of time, planning, and money. Companies are becoming more inclined to take a different approach for building these systems. In a lot of these cases it is easier for a business to build their own system in the cloud using products from companies such as Microsoft or Amazon for more customizability.

Another big issue is the concern over customer data with CRM systems. A company might opt to develop their own CRM systems where they can ensure that customer data is obeying customer privacy laws and allows them to have more control over private data. This can help build a better relationship with the customer. Privacy issues over customer data has obviously become a big issue in 2020.

Furthermore, Salesforce has been trying to get into more areas with [recent acquisitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce). Similar to SAP, I suspect that Salesforce will crush over their own weight as they try to expand their company. One good example of this is their recent acquisition of Slack. Slack does not really fit any of Salesforce ecosystem and is really just an attempt to expand into a different area. Slack has a lot of competition from Microsoft teams and other companies which can do what Slack does but better.

Business will start to move away from Salesforce similar to SAP. This is not to say that they be completely independent as Salesforce does make some parts of the businesses easier. However there seems to be a strong resemblance to SAP based on what I know from inside of a corporation using both SAP and Salesforce and the many issues they face when they try and customize their solutions.

Edit: Just take a look a the reviews for salesforce [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/salesforce.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/salesforce.com)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So how can we use this information to print tendies? The expectation is that Salesforce will eventually slow their growth down while stock is overhyped due to being a cloud company and start to fall or go sideways like SAP.

&#x200B;

Basically the idea is to try and play puts, especially around earnings. If Salesforce misses their guidance then the stock could be in a serious reversal especially for a cloud company with a lot of hype. The next earnings will be late February/early March.

You can also try and play longer term puts but the stock is fairly volatile like SAP and I would only do this if you see the price go up significantly.

&#x200B;

tldr; buy puts for late February/early March

Also english is not my native language, so forgive any errors*

In the last few years there's been a lot of speculation around the shift to renewables. A lot of people are bullish on solar, wind an EVs and are very bearish on big oil companies. I'm going to explain to you why **the government(s) shift to ""clean energy"" and the recent oil crisis  is actually very bullish for big oil in the medium to long term**.

# Renewables cannot exist without oil

Basically as it turns out, **current tech for solar and wind sucks big time**, and it probably will for decades to come. Not only they are nowhere near as enviromentally sustainable as nuclear power (because they need lots of terrain,  use 20x more resources than nuclear fission power plants, and there are recycling issues), but most importantly, these green plants depend on the sun shining and the wind blowing, so **they can only run and produce energy about 30% of the time.** The key here is that there is no real efficient way (no, pumping and dumping water is not efficient) to have these plants running without coupling them with fossil fuel burning regular plants, beacuse otherwise the electric power grid would be a mess. **So the real reason that all these oil companies are fine with the government shifting to green energy is that, to run this utopia of solar panels, wind turbines, and EVs, you'll still need their oil**. In fact, these companies are the ones that are lobbying politicians (in particular democrats, in the US case), persuading it to pursue this ""green"" bullshit instead of going with real less harmful choice, which is regular old nuclear energy.

# The 2020 oil price shock benefits BIG oil companies in the long run

The oil price disaster in march might cause a short term problem with oil companies, but **BIG oil companies rubbed their hands**. Maybe the small oil companies or the ones with lots of debt can face problems and go out of business, but **the GIANT with a healthy balance sheet can survive the crisis and have even more market share**. You have to think about this as if oil companies were coffee shops. During corona, many closed and never opened again becaus eof bankrupcty, so the ones that had lots of cash available before the big hit, the big players like Starbucks, will benefit when there is full or partail reopening of the economy.

# Oil demand will not shrink that much

If people knew that **oil is not just used for powering engines**, they probably wouldn't have such a negative outlook on oil demand. Guys, oil is fucking used to build anything that is made out of **plastic**. Even to make some **medications** you need stuff that comes from oil. To get all the useless shit that the west buys from India and China, you'll still need oil to power **container ships** that sail the ocean. Once this corona shit is over, people will still buy plane tickets to go on vacation. Sure, maybe business trips will take a permanent hit and there be slightly less demand due to the transition to ""green"", BUT, as we said earlier, green still needs it .... and we are still not adressing the elephant in the room: there are massive **emerging markets economies** growing in the worild today, a lot of second and third world countries that will still rely on oil for their initial growth for decades. These countries will offset the loss of demand from developed nations. Shit, general commodities prices have been skyrocketing recently. You wanna jump on steel gang and not on oil gang? The only way oil prices fall from here is if OPEC shits the bed.

# The play

As long as this obsession for and complete ignorance and denial on how to solve climate change continues, and as long as the goverments of the west are corrupt and cannot see that they need to boost nuclear power and public transportation instead of solar, wind and EVs, big oil companies with a heathy balance sheet will be fine in the next decade. **Many oil companies are trading at or below book value, with massive dividend yields**, it won't stay like this forever. Do yourself a favour and be long on **RDS, XOM, BP, TOT, CVX and maybe even the italian E**. Saw a lot of hedge funds buying **OXY** in the past few months for some reason. Either buy shares, and if you are a brave man use leverage. I wouldn't advise options on this one since we don't know when the catalyst for the rally will come, and one of the main points of the play is to get that juicy dividend. If you just need to use options, use LEAPS for the love of god. I expect a return of AT LEAST 20% on the shares alone, maybe even a lot more.

TRUELY HONORED TO BE PART OF THE GME FAM. üöÄ

# Introduction

[**PDF VERSION HERE**](https://gofile.io/d/RvbNnA) (20+ pages) with all the references and better quality illustrations but without updates and typo corrections. This is the FIRST VERSION of the post, but there could be more edits. I wanted to do a more extensive DD but as my exams start tomorrow I don‚Äôt have more time. If you want to take my work and extend it, please feel free to do so, just give a little shout out.

***FIRST AND FOREMOST, SHOUTOUT TO üöÄüíéüôå GME GANG üíéüôå üöÄ, YOU‚ÄôRE IN MY ‚ù§Ô∏è.***

**This DD is just my own analysis. I put my money where my mouth is but this is definitely not advice. Do your own DD.**

**Last thing**:  Some stuff might be unsourced in this post but everything is sourced in the pdf version. While it‚Äôs not impossible that I might have missed some stuff, most of the time I put the stuff that I quote from other sources in italics. My ego is not big enough to feel like reformulating other people‚Äôs ideas and even less to steal other people's ideas. All I do is just gather insightful facts, figures, ideas and analysis.

# Big picture

## 1.1 Macroeconomic View

I will be brief here, I think everyone knows what‚Äôs up basically.

[Figure 1: although the USD is worth a lot less, the S&P 500 is doing alright. Thanks Jerome.](https://preview.redd.it/iqtnlebs96961.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=056c4261f530831621fb22bf4f4bf199e5e21f6a)

Enthusiasm is the key word here as we are in an environment with a very accommodative monetary and fiscal policy (thanks for the stimulus checks). Equities and Bitcoin hit record highs thanks to positive vaccine news and the markets hope for a fiscal package. The Federal Reserve is going heavy on asset purchases, bailouts and loans. And its balance sheet is expanding as well as money supply. Interest rates are extremely low.

Check for example, the [Shiller PE ratio](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) to see the enthusiasm driving the markets.

On a macro-level side from the risks related to the pandemic, the only worrying signs would be the shrinking money velocity or a suddenly-rising inflation (hyperinflation is bullish for stocks but not for the real economy).

That being said, we know how the FED and the government reacted to support the economy and the markets. Low interest rates and weak US dollar which is continuing to depreciate is very bullish for stocks overall.

I keep the macroeconomic view very short for that GME correlation with the S&P 500 is low - about 28% over the last 6 months. Moreover despite GME‚Äôs heavy reliance on brick-and-mortar stores, GME continues to get closer to profitability even with the pandemic.

If the pandemic would make the stock market to crash again during the trade, I wouldn't sell at a loss but wait a few days and then buy a LEAPS. This is my plan. Don't follow it, just make sure you have a plan in case it happens, it's important to avoid buying too much the first dip (because you might get a better price later) or worse, avoid a panic-selling and take a loss instead of tendies.

## 1.2 Sector(s) View

[Figure 4: Video game market value worldwide from 2012 to 2023 \(in billion USD\)](https://preview.redd.it/zcaacwtnd6961.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e1ff470e54a8f9821f188793f7bbd2bee5d0986)

[Figure 5:  Retail ecommerce sales in the United States from 2017 to 2024 \(in million USD\)](https://preview.redd.it/51jh22amd6961.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=10993f493748a17354b3fb4e83dd7781da73c0f7)

Video game total adressable market and ecommerce total adressable market keep growing, that's all we need to know on a macro-level. Now, the real question is not about the market itself but about the compny business model.

# GameStop Corp.

* Market cap   $1.31B
* 1-year performance  209.87%
* Shares outstanding  69.75M
* Short interest   68.13M (97.68% of the outstanding shares)
* Held by insiders  Between 13.6% to 27.3%
* Held by institutions  Between 110.5% to 122.0%
* Owned by Ryan Cohen 12.9%
* Owned by BlackRock  17.1%

## 2.2 Timeline

&#x200B;

[Table 1: GameStop timeline.](https://preview.redd.it/0cx8brwjd6961.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=84f8c8be4a5cb3596703a03d399e34a4b227206a)

*Short-term the sector is pretty hot with quarantines and the launch of next-generation consoles which will impact positively year-on-year sales growth. The pandemic could have been an opportunity but GME has still too many physical stores and not enough ecommerce presence yet to take advantage of it.*

For the next earning release, the question is : how much PS5 and Xbox GameStop was able to get? And how much they sold in bundles (at high margins)?

Although it‚Äôs still unclear from what I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs pretty bullish:

*GameStop Corp. employees across the country were caught by surprise on Saturday when the video-game chain suddenly announced new shipments of the highly coveted PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles* \- [bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/gamestop-employees-rattled-by-surprise-shipment-of-ps4-xbox](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/gamestop-employees-rattled-by-surprise-shipment-of-ps4-xbox)

The recent **Microsoft deal** is extremely bullish for GameStop and could help the company to reach profitability sooner than expected. Here are the details about how it could impact GameStop‚Äôs profitability:

* *In years 3 and 4 combined, if just 5 million customers extend the subscription for two years, GameStop makes $180 million in incremental profit with zero cost involved. That's nearly a quarter of GameStop's current market cap in recurring income at 100% margin*. - Justin Dopierala, ‚Äú[GameStop Revenue Sharing Agreement With Microsoft Shifts Sentiment](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378623-gamestop-revenue-sharing-agreement-microsoft-shifts-sentiment).‚Äù SeekingAlpha.

## 2.2 Business Model and Management

* Gamestop is omnichanneling into **online activities** according to Ryan Cohen recommendations although it doesn‚Äôt mean they will execute it perfectly this is bullish.
   * ‚Äú*GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences ‚Äì not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem.*‚Äù Ryan Cohen.

[Table 2: GameStop is dangerously \(for the shorts\) getting close to profitability.](https://preview.redd.it/awmm34afd6961.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&s=e22229a87f8b29e59f43822c903a54893b9e3a6a)

* *The company attributes the losses this quarter to the end of the console cycle and the limited hardware and accessory availability that came with that, as well as various game delays, and an 11% reduction in its store base - partially offset by recaptured sales at other locations and online*. ‚Üí **The company should be profitable very soon** **despite being priced for bankruptcy for a long time ‚Üí Expectations are incrediblly low until recently, more investors are believing in the vision esp. with Ryan Cohen.**
* GME **e-commerce sales were up 257% year-over-year**.
* GME **reduced its selling, general, and administrative expenses by $115 million**.
* GME **repaid $10 million in debt in Q3 2020**.
* *GME is* ***diversifying sales to include more high margin items*** *like PC accessories, PC monitors, etc (If I speculate, there may be partnerships with certain brands).*
* ***Focusing on loyalty programs*** *like power ups and* ***rebranding***.
* As of Feb. 2020, GameStop had 5,509 physical stores.
* GME is **closing unprofitable locations**: they are closing 1,000 stores in Q1 2021 (by the end of March of 2021).
   * I‚Äôd like to quote a fellow GME gang member on this: *It's no secret that brick and mortar is falling off, and if GameStop were to fight tooth and nail to remain a largely brick and mortar retailer they would go bankrupt in no time. It is also a fact that underperforming stores drain cash, which lowers net income and thus lowers earnings per share. Any store that is LOSING MONEY or is barely breaking even is keeping the stock price down because it's preventing future growth and killing net incomes. Closing underperforming stores will lead to a higher EPS and more cash that can be allocated to growth.* \- horny131313.
* *Gamestop is rebranding, and shifting to becoming the one stop video game and video game related product online retailer. While we haven't seen exactly what this will be, it is bullish to see them pivoting into other products besides just video games. Headsets, TVS, PC parts, you name it. You've seen the omnichannel memes, but we know that If they are bullshitting, Cohen will step in. Expect to see real progress made.*

Some words from the last earnings:

* ""*We anticipate, for the first time in many quarters, that the fourth quarter will include* *positive year-on-year sales growth and profitability*\*, reflecting the introduction of\* *new gaming consoles*\*, our\* *elevated omni-channel capabilities* *and continued* *benefits from our cost and efficiency initiatives*\*, even with the potential further negative impacts on our operations due to the global COVID-19 pandemic.\*"" George Sherman, CEO.

Possible catalysts (from KYJELLYTIME69):

* A possible new Nintendo console release in \~1-2 years
* Currently distressed commercial REITs = ability to negotiate lower rent = more $$$
* Likely return of inflation (debatable but money supply ballooned and we are seeing velocity pick up a bit) with JPOW promising to keep rates at 0% even when inflation comes back = bullish for all stocks, bears will get slaughtered
* OG printer Yellen manning the treasury in a month + possible dem senate = more stimmy checks = more money going into GME
* If sales improve and balance sheets continue improve, we might see more credit upgrades
* Better sales = possible dividend reinstatement, I couldn't care less about dividends but guess who's going to be paying? The shorts lol. If Sherman had balls, he would pull an OSTK and announce a special dividend , which will actually lead to a short squeeze while wsb laughs collectively as we get meme returns from this boomer move.

## 2.3 The Short-Squeeze Thesis

&#x200B;

[Figure 6: Stare statistics from Oct. 2019 to Nov. 2020](https://preview.redd.it/juvh5y1bd6961.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=614c135c89f8d0e5a168e20c3e68cfd3005a5c7c)

**In terms of metrics**, the DTC (days-to-cover) actually decreases, lowering the probability to get a short-squeeze short-term. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this DOESN‚ÄôT mean that it can‚Äôt happen, the % of shares shorted is still crazy high.

**Days to cover**: *It gives investors an idea of potential future buying pressure. In the event of a rally in the stock, short sellers must buy back shares on the open market to close out their positions. Understandably, they will seek to purchase the shares back for the lowest price possible, and this urgency to get out of their positions could translate into sharp moves higher. The longer the buyback process takes, as referenced by the 'days to cover' metric, the longer the price rally may continue based solely on the need of short sellers to close their positions. Additionally, a high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze. This information can benefit a trader looking to make a quick profit by buying that company's shares ahead of the anticipated event actually coming to fruition.* (Investopedia).

**In terms of corporate actions**, here is a quote from September mentioning the hostile takeover from Ryan which would trigger a massive short-squeeze, here is the explanation:

***Short Squeeze Potential -*** *If Ryan Cohen successfully negotiates a purchase price with the Board then the shareholders will have to vote on it. Unlike the proxy battle where Hestia and Permit were running a minority slate of directors, an offer to purchase GameStop would force institutions like Vanguard and Blackrock to call in their shares. By doing so, the shorts would be forced to close out their positions and GameStop would finally have the greatest short squeeze of all-time. Ironically, Cohen could use this opportunity to sell all of his shares and use the proceeds to entirely fund the acquisition of GameStop going down as the first person in history to acquire a billion dollar company... for absolutely nothing. In fact, his acquisition price would be less than zero. It will be exciting to see how it all plays out as according to Bloomberg/WSJ there are now 58 million shares short as of 8/31/2020 with only 65 million shares outstanding.*

*If I were short, I'd be sweating bullets right now. This won't end well and will ruin many*.

Justin Dopierala is President and Founder of DOMO Capital.

**How to know when the potential short-squeeze could happen?**

* *Massive volume in short dated calls. \[...\] If you have shares, DO NOT SELL COVERED CALLS FROM THEM. by doing this you make the likelihood of a squeeze decrease.* \- horny131313
* U*nwind their short position with some behind closed doors deal. A scenario like this could include: Melvin offering shares of other stocks at discounted prices in exchange for GME shares or to unload a portion of their short shares. The second party to this deal could also offer to buy GME shares for higher than market prices* \- horny131313

If you want to do a further analysis on short-metrics I put some additional figures - you might find some kind of pattern idk.

[Figure 8: Share statistics of December 2020](https://preview.redd.it/ijbl9ay4d6961.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd9d0e786520d092df26cc80effa0dbe147cde2f)

[Figure 9: Available shares to short vs. fees in &#37;.](https://preview.redd.it/7sp7ni43d6961.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=42ac1cdfbfdc4e0dbe6b3b256893e885e876c74c)

## 2.4 Is GME Manipulated?

Maybe.

[I know there is actually a prob. with the &#37; daily returns \(it isn't equal to 100&#37; BUT the proportions still hold true on a non 100 point basis\). The main point is that: negative daily returns were much higher than positive ones.](https://preview.redd.it/xyzx8bl1d6961.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=efcf0647ba66214ff5fbb75f177f65d3cdb053d3)

If you are familiar with the stock market, you might have noticed that winners do not act like this usually: total return was +21% yet there has been 53.3% red days. If you look at regular stocks which have positive cumulative returns it doesn‚Äôt happen that often (outliers aside).

This is why I suspect that the stock is being manipulated but the weird stats might be explained just because the stock kept being shorted although it was not enough to keep the price down.

Another opinion on this:

* *Melvin and BoA both have short positions, and are desperately trying to drive the price down. Unfortunately, it is getting harder and harder to convince people that gamestop is a failing business. They are sweating and will continue to sweat. Given the buy side volume, they could close these short positions gradually without triggering a massive squeeze, however it WILL drive the price up significantly higher than it is now.* \- horny131313.

## 2.5 What 2020 Has Taught Us?

I think at this point it is the wrong question to ask (*is the stock being manipulated?*). To me, the most important thing is what is the upside potential and the risks associated? Then, how to trade GME?

* *If you're new to gamestop, the volatility will seem scary but the shorts fight hard with this one. -10% days followed by +20% days are not unusual.* \- horny131313

I would like to elaborate on this very idea. For this, check GME statistics for 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/t05xum2zc6961.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2e092560bba3b3091a6fe8bf0bceea2ce7b9f5c

https://preview.redd.it/odbxo3sxc6961.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=7897f1dac841aa381b916046c3652e2d2c4ece68

* Whether the stock is manipulated or not, MOST of the 2020 trading days were negative.
* The worst daily returns were hard to handle honestly we are talking multiple worst than 14% daily drawdowns.
* You could more than triple your money WITHOUT LEVERAGE.
* Let‚Äôs say you bought late Apr. and sold late Aug. you could have been at -13% returns and +31% the next week if you had diamond hands. For the real diamond hands you had +147% returns the next 2 months.

Psychologically this was a hard trade for sure. But for those who had diamond hands, it was pretty amazing. If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable being at -20% or even -30% returns for months before the stock literally BLOWS UP‚Ä¶ Reduce your position and diamond hand with a smaller size. Better to win with less than lose with a lot‚Ä¶

**TLTR: DIAMOND-HAND THIS OR DON‚ÄôT TRADE THIS AT ALL.**

# Risks

## 3.1 Upside Risks

* RC Ventures LLC increases its stake.
   * It could be VERY soon. On the 31 December 2020, someone bought 900K shares, it could be Ryan Cohen given the size of its last purchases:

[ Figure 10: Last RC Ventures GME Purchases. Notice how the biggest numbers \(e.g. 800K & 500K\) while the smaller ones weren't \(e.g. 320K, 256K or 128K\).](https://preview.redd.it/j73tsjhuc6961.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=edd9813501b1af9aa9d0634702fcd4e2507e788e)

[Figure 11: Check who tweeted this on the same date as the 900K shares purchase?](https://preview.redd.it/9j3hgvksc6961.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a9188f79a155f4f97a29f3f48fcce02a3a93701)

**EDIT :** ***the recent 900K-share purchase after hours were not ""purchases"", it was quarterly option settlement.*** **- KYJELLYTIME69.**

* This is very bullish because after the disclosure of additional buying from Cohen last time, even though it strangely took 1 full trading day for the market to pop up, GME shot up 29%.
* Surprise investors with their holiday sales and/or EPS.
   * *GME will more than likely beat earnings next quarter. I won't go into much detail into this because it is not my expertise, however* u/Uberkikz11 *has done some amazing DD and has been doing so for a long time. This guy literally goes into GameStop stores to get his information. Read this:* [*https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh9na8/gme\_4q20\_financial\_model/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh9na8/gme_4q20_financial_model/) \- horny131313
* RC Ventures LLC gets more than one seat on the board.
* RC Ventures LLC begins a hostile takeover.
   * On top of its increasing stake, Ryan is supported by both a lot of small and now large investors too.
   * Moreover ‚Äú*there is a decent amount of evidence that Ryan Cohen spent the summer of 2020 hiring a badass lawyer and crafting a pretty solid plan to wrest control of a struggling Mall-based gaming retailer from its out of touch Boomer Board and CEO so he can turn it into an ecommerce juggernaut like his baby Chewy. the attorney listed on each of the 13Ds filed by RC Ventures. \[...\] Chris Davis, Activist Attorney Extraordinaire and His Successful Use of the Consent Solicitation to Remove Dipshit Boards/CEOs‚Äù* \- CPTHubbard.
* Moody's Upgrades GameStop's credit rating a second time in a row
   * *Hoping for a PR soon confirming the recent redemption of the 2021 notes. Potential credit upgrade from Moodys could come now that GME has officially redeemed 63% of their 2021 notes. If we don't get that now, we should get it in March when the entirety of the 2021 notes are retired. Debt considered investment grade and not junk is a big positive and one most overlook.* \- Stonksflyingup
* Short sellers close a part of their position huge short position.
* A major hedge fund takes a significant position on GME.
* Dividend reintroduction.

## 3.2 Downside Risks

* New short sellers open a position and current ones scale up theirs.
* Momentum towards profitability dies out and the company goes bankrupt.
   * Honestly if you read this far you know this is extremely unlikely.
* Share dilution.

## 3.3 Overview

&#x200B;

[Table 6: Upside risks](https://preview.redd.it/e46jey6nc6961.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bdfbdaf27d5caaf93fea0973ff3f114ab875eee)

[Table 7: Downside risks](https://preview.redd.it/085l0xbic6961.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=97f4fedef4b899b1ad49ed0dceb47144644b85ca)

## 3.4 Commentary

[Figure 12: GME is one of or even THE most shorted stock for its valuation \(in terms of &#37; short interest\).](https://preview.redd.it/ag3sc9q9c6961.png?width=1023&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d55ae8902ba4f3cd3dd4120f698c077b75633ce)

This means two things:

* It is very unlikely for the shorts to continue to short the company especially when its credit rating is being upgraded - we will see if it keeps getting upgraded or not in March.
* If the shorts get to short it more (or new short sellers open a position) it will:
   * Drive the stock price down (lower market cap), drive the short ratio higher making the unwinding of the short sellers even harder and as a result making the probability to have a short-squeeze VERY BIG if good events happen moving forward.
   * Push Ryan Cohen to accelerate its plans.
      * *I will personally increase my share-position if it happens.*

# Conclusion

## 4.1 Prices Targets

Here is a summary of [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kow6gs/gme_price_targets_for_2021_according_to_the_short/):

When the short % of free float went from a high point (\~160%) at around February 2020 to a low point (\~140%) - which by the way are in absolute terms both huge numbers- the stock went up \~94% **BUT** most of the gain took place at 2 key moments: at the recovery of the market crash and then in late August which shows that üíéüôå-ing is key to capture most of the gains.

[Figure 13: GME returns from 3 Feb. 2020 to 1 Sept. 2020](https://preview.redd.it/5ysyfz35c6961.png?width=614&format=png&auto=webp&s=541ade007b74cb376a2477c6705c87999c51cdb5)

Why do I say this? Because when holding the stock you could ‚Äúfeel‚Äù like you bled when you watch the stats:

|Positive daily returns|Negative daily returns|
|:-|:-|
|49.3 %|50.7 %|

But IT WAS IN FACT THE SHORT SELLERS WHO BLED HARD:

|Best daily return|Worst daily return|

Imagine you sold GME when the -13.7% happened. You would not have captured the 94% returns. So just üíéüôå and let those shorts go bankrupt.

**FAQ 1 : Is GameStop going bankrupt?**  300%+ yearly growth ecom sales, already closing top \~20% of their most unprofitable locations, high margin partnership with Microsoft, new gaming console generation, Moody's recent credit upgrade on 8 Jul 2020 from C (negative outlook) to B3 (stable outlook)... So extremely unlikely.

**FAQ 2 : GameStop employees complain about the company, so is the stock going down?** Well listen to Apple's iPhone manufacturers or Amazon employees... There is no correlation between their words and the stock price, if any there is a negative one.

**Positions**: shares, Nov. calls and some cash on the sidelines to buy the dips.

kpu9z2||Why Index Funds are Not as Safe and Bubbles are Not as Destructive as You Might Believe|t3_kpu9z2|0.97|1226|1226|top|2021-01-04 01:08:58.000000|negovany|250|DD|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kpu9z2/why_index_funds_are_not_as_safe_and_bubbles_are/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kpu9z2/why_index_funds_are_not_as_safe_and_bubbles_are/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kpu9z2/why_index_funds_are_not_as_safe_and_bubbles_are/|"According to Morningstar research in the middle of 2019 almost half of all US stocks were part of some passive index fund. This number almost doubled since 2009. In the meantime, active management is on a steady decline, especially active managed funds. Around the same time Dr. Michael Burry compared index funds to CDOs. Let‚Äôs look into this case and try to draw something from it for our benefit.

**1. How come index funds are compared to CDOs if they only track industries or sectors of economy?**

What we often miss is that the index fund, instead of being a neutral observer, is an active participant in the fundamentals of the companies that compose a particular index. The fund does so by providing capital and influencing market value of a security (this also opens a window of opportunities for the company behind the ticker to raise capital via bank loans or private investments). What‚Äôs so bad about this? Well, passive funds don‚Äôt go through balance sheets, there is no fair value assessment, no analysis and no risk taking. They just buy whatever company is big enough to make it into the index. This company can then use provided capital to stay afloat or influence it‚Äôs price by share buybacks, dividends or simply pay huge bonuses to it‚Äôs management. Just like banks didn‚Äôt care about subprime mortgages that were packed into CDOs, index funds managers don‚Äôt care about what exactly goes into their ‚Äòsoup‚Äô. With the banks it was just greed and ignorance ‚Äì in case of index funds it‚Äôs by design.

When there is a stable influx of new capital into passive funds, zombie companies are dragged higher and higher. WSB goddess **Cathie Wood** called this the greatest misallocation of funds in the history. But why is so much cash flowing into index funds? Is it a trend? Is someone incentivized to promote them? Well, yes, but the main reason is different: boomer psychology and our friend, the FED. See, boomers have massive capitals. All those pension funds, retiring firefighters, trust babies, capital heirs ‚Äì they all seek safety. They don‚Äôt try to get 500% returns YOY or lose it all. They are very content with just beating inflation. Throw few percents above inflation and they will be over the moon. For a long time their favorite asset class were treasuries.

**2. What is happening to the bond market?**

In 2016 US bond market was almost $40 trillion in value, compared to less than $20 trillion for the domestic stock market.  Now, I haven‚Äôt seen yet the data about the size of US bond market of 2020, but everything points that it‚Äôs ratio to stock market is deteriorating. The US 10-year government-bond yield fell from nearly 2.00% at the beginning of the year to an all-time low of just 0.31% in early March. That‚Äôs what Rick Rule called ‚Äòreturn free risk‚Äô, since allocating capital into these treasuries almost guarantees you to lose money to inflation.

https://preview.redd.it/q6r2fhqfu6961.png?width=1372&format=png&auto=webp&s=b72fad038a47ee1a0adca587881f46bafc25cc89

Look at what is happening in Europe: ‚ÄúThe ECB, which added 500 billion euros ($606 billion) to its pandemic bond buying program, is set to own around 43% of Germany‚Äôs sovereign bond market by the end of next year and around two-fifths of Italian notes, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. That‚Äôs up from around 30% and 25% respectively at the end of 2019... Trading volumes in bund futures have collapsed 62% since the ECB started buying bonds, according to Axa, while ranges the lifeblood of traders have nosedived across Europe. In both the safest and riskiest nations, this quarter‚Äôs spread between the highest and lowest yields is the tightest it‚Äôs been since at least the global financial crisis.‚Äù

The FED is doing quite the same. Buying bonds (including corporate) all over the place and lowering interest rates to the ground. What‚Äôs even more devastating for boomers is that there‚Äôs no hope on the horizon: the FED promises to keep interest rates low for the next few years. We are really heading towards Japan situation where the central bank is that fat ugly bully kid playing all by himself in the sandbox.

**3. Where to go if the bonds are not so hot?**

This all causes big money to chase the next best thing. What do people consider safe? Real Estate. And indeed it rose: according to Knight Frank Global House price index US housing prices rose 7% from Q3 2019 to Q3 2020. But that‚Äôs a lot of hustle for big money. And that is hardly a passive income, rather a career. So the next best thing is index funds. What can be better than tracking the whole US economy? Never bet against America, am I right? Even if we stumble upon a market crash sending S&P down ‚Äì the economy will recover, it always does, right? The influx of cash into ETFs is basically a self fulfilling prophecy: it drives prices up and those yearly returns get even more lucrative compared to *sexy* 0.31% provided by treasuries.

[The data shows that 2019-2020 saw again a spike in passive management allocation, but I couldn't find more up to date graph ](https://preview.redd.it/db73yu15u6961.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d03efe94938505122915c672d823855b779f6ef)

Even worse is that actively managed funds and bank investments start to, basically, replicate index funds. That is due to the risk/reward factor: if the funds outperform the market - they get some good rep and few new customers; but when they underperform the market ‚Äì they get absolutely obliterated. Only few outsiders can risk picking deep value stocks or plays, that are not common portfolio dwellers. Or it takes someone with huge authority like Warren Buffett or Howard Marks.

**4. Bubbles everywhere**

Now, at this point you might be on the edge of your seat, banging your fist and thinking that this is nothing but a bubble and the boomers, index funds and the FED are to blame. Well, it is. Hard truth is that fundamentals in the long run always kick-in. So-called Buffett indicator (total stocks market cap to GDP) is almost at a record high. And on top of that we have Dot.com bubble 2.0 with crazy tech enthusiasm. And a second real estate bubble too. But I urge you to notice, that bubbles are not all the same with the same outcome. Well, they all go burst, but that‚Äôs not the point. There are bubbles that I would call ‚ÄòGeneral Market Heat‚Äô - situations when too much money goes into the market, causing it to overheat. Then some sort of event, panic, fear, or rumor, not necessary caused by declining fundamentals, sends the market to downward spiral. As an example: panic of 1857, 1929, 1987, etc. The better the fundamentals were and the least the government gets involved ‚Äì the faster it rebounds. Those bubbles do nothing but attract more speculators and their only result is the number of bankruptcies. Then there are bubbles that I would call ‚ÄòThematic Bubbles‚Äô - those are dedicated to some specific industry or a number of particular stocks that are expected to grow enormously. Tulip Mania in Netherlands (1637), Railway Mania in UK (1840s), Video Games Crash of 1983, Dot Com Bubble (2000). They all chased some particular novelty and all landed on their faces. But doing so they provided huge capital to developing industries. Dot Com Bubble gave us rapid growth of internet usage. Video Games chase of the late 70s and early 80s gave us the golden age of arcade gaming and huge inventions in graphics and game tech. Railway Mania left Britain with the largest system of railroads in the world. And guess who is the biggest exporter of tulips and holds 49 % of the global flower market? Yep, Netherlands, to this day, almost 400 years since the mania!

This did not in any way benefit the majority of investors who went down with the bubble. But you can view this as a sacrifice of dumb and greedy people for the benefit of the progress. I get a sense of pride in this noble cause, as a member of WSB community.

Back to boomers and index funds. By pouring money into index funds they provide capital both to disruptive industries and to zombie companies. The good thing is that the tech gets the majority of it, since it has the biggest share. Just look at the SPY top 6 holdings:

https://preview.redd.it/ien160wku6961.png?width=361&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4fb8528478110ff0f2d5f9e1a793d7b5e5a9085

It‚Äôs genuinely good that companies like Tesla will get allocation of billions and billions which they (frankly) do not quite deserve at current fundamentals. This will accelerate their growth. The bad thing is that such allocations cement big tech monopolies, damaging competition. And it also provides liquidity to zombie companies big enough to make it into indexes.

Difference is that innovative companies use this cash to reinvest into future growth. That‚Äôs exactly why their P/E ratios are so bad. Zombies spend cash on buybacks and management bonuses. Because of how all these companies are tied together in index funds and due to the nature of modern margin calls ‚Äì once any segment of the stock market falls, there will be a massive dip. Tech can drown any industry stocks with them and vice versa. But the Tech will be able to cut investments, R&D and expansions and become profitable, while zombies with a big debt will go bankrupt. Either way it‚Äôs investors, who will bear the pain.

**5. What shall we draw from here:**

&#x200B;

1. There are huge inflows into the stock market. And the blame is not so much on the kids with RH as it is on the boomers and ‚Äòsmart money‚Äô chasing index funds;
2. If you want to short any of the bubbles as a hedge ‚Äì do not short the most growing and volatile sectors and ETFs like QQQ, because they benefit from the current market in a long run. And also the premiums are huge due to IV. Rather short slow and steady industries, because they will get nuked just as much in case of a crash, but the premiums you pay now will be much lower;
3. Passive index funds investing makes ‚Äòprice discovery‚Äô and a search for deep value so much more challenging. But not impossible. Basically, Peter Lynch‚Äôs advise to look for companies with smaller institutional ownership still lives up today. Does this mean that prices can‚Äôt be good or go up under big index allocation? Hell no. But the chance to find a ten-bagger declines.As an anecdote: look into our champion‚Äôs GME institutional ownership: on Jan 31 2020 it was 96.6 % and declined to relatively low 66.7 by Sep 30. Exactly before it doubled in the next 3 months;
4. Some bubbles provide needed capital to developing and hyped industries causing structural change. Unfortunately, it is paid by investors who rarely see any return;
5. FED is to blame for everything (as always);
6. WSBers will lose money either way (as always).

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

**The bond market is similar to boomers wives: sexy in the 80s, not so much today. Constant intrusions by their relatives (the FED) into their relationships makes things even worse. That sends boomers chasing young girls - the stocks. But their dongles aren‚Äôt so active anymore, so boomers prefer passive approach, using a dating app - index funds. Unfortunately, there are only so many hot girls among young ladies on the app. This leads to ugly ones receiving attention and money from boomers, which they otherwise wouldn‚Äôt deserve. Some of those ladies spend money wisely and will be good to go once the boomer dies out. Others immediately waste it on shopping. Now, if a young man wants to find a truly beautiful lady with reasonable expectations ‚Äì he has a better chance searching outside of the boomer dating app.**

During intraday low for the market, the Dow was down as much as -700 pts (-2.3%), Nasdaq -345 pts (-2.6%), and S&P -94 (-2.5%). WSB reeled in horror as stonk somehow doesn't always go up. Beyond renewed COVID fear, market sell-off accelerated in the morning after 10 AM as the market continues to keep an eye on the GA run-off election with polls increasingly being more favorable for the DNC candidates. No doubt an extra wrench was thrown to the GA GOP Senate campaigns as POTUS continues to pressure GA officials on figuring out votes - cuz that's totes normal thing for a sitting President to do.

* For those WSBer who failed basic HS civics class, just one GOP win in the two run-off Senate seats will keep Biden's more progressive agenda at bay (and likely the recent tax cut intact) as the GOP and McTurtle retain control of the Senate. Conversely, Dems winning both seats will secure both legislative branch for Dems, as VP Harris be the tie breaking vote in the Senate. Will this mean an eventual bigger stimulus package? A renew market-sell off? Should ANTM, UNH, and others quiver in fear? Find out later this week as results will unlikely be clear even after polls are close on Tues night.

* With renewed COVID fear as the UK variant likely running rampant undetected in the US, shares of travel sector are pressured today. In airlines, AAL closed down -4% to $15.13, UAL -3.75% to $41.63, and LUV -3.37% to $45.04 (similar price action across the sector for JBLU, SAVE, etc.). Cruise stocks took a bigger beating with NCLH down -6.69% to $23.73, RCL down -5.23% to $70.72, and CCL down -5.91% to $20.38. Conversely, safe plays and essential stores such as WMT, TGT, and COST are all up today at 1.65%, 0.62%, and 0.89% despite S&P being red.

* Jack Ma, Alibaba's very public CEO has reportedly been missing in action in the past few months as speculation starts floating about his disappearance due to the CCP. While memes float about of Ma being tucked away in a Chinese state prison with Randy Marsh due to pissing off Pooh Bear, shares of BABA continues to be pressured despite a rebound last week as CCP's antitrust probe on both Alibaba and its subsidiary Ant Group chugs on. BABA closed the day -2.10% at $227.85, while competitors PDD closed -6.13% to $166.78, and JD closed the day -1.79% at $86.33. 

*  QS, the SPAC turned meme EV stock took a nice more than -40% dive today as shares sold off on... well, who the fuck knows why it sold off (PIPE shares became available and are no longer locked? I didn't look into the lockup period, someone let me know the dates). The EV battery maker took on a NKLA-like trajectory and rallied as high as $120 before steadily trimming its gains in the past week. For those who are adventurous in selling the IV, OTM Jan 15 puts such as 35p are going for $1.55 while 40p are going for $3.3. But honestly, do you really want to baghold QS at those pricing if assigned (cash secured)? Go with a spread, you dumb fuck. Shares closed the day down more than $34 (-40.84%) to $49.96. If you sold puts before today, you dun goofed.

* QS edit: thanks to trojanattorney1 [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqi8e8/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_and_recent_market_driving/gi48nvd/): more early investor shares were available today and millions were dumped into the market. If you're trying to catch the QS knife, be warned as there are many more dilution to go. You can check recent filing [here](https://sec.report/Ticker/QS) if you're so inclined.

*  Haven, the AMZN + BRK + JPM venture in ""disrupting"" health care has disbanded after a 3 year attempt. Turns out having sensible health care in America is hard as fuck. Shares of healthcare companies UNH, HUM, et al. were up during pre-market and morning hours, but faded through the day as overall macro pushed the sector down.

*  In more ""I thought this is America"" news, more than 200 GOOGL employees and contractors in both the US and Canada have decided to unionized to promote a less shitty workplace and ethical business practices (once a upon a time, Google's motto was ""Do No Evil.""). Collectively known as the Alphabet Workers Union, the group's aim is to start small and eventually amass enough membership to actually address some of the more lofty goals: namely pay and working conditions. GOOGL closed the day down -1.51%, though more likely due to overall macro than this thus far non-material news.

*  Elon chan and his meme stock continues to kill whatever remaining short sellers are left, as TSLA reaches new ATH after Q4 delivery report. Despite the FY number being ""missed"" by 450 vehicles, the quarterly delivery of 180,570 vehicles handily beat Wall Street's estimate of about 174k vehicles and shares are up bigly to close up 3.42% at $729.77. How did we ever doubt those WSB degens who loaded up $3,500 strike Jan 15 calls pre-split which are now ITM!? Truly, they were ahead of the times in knowing that TSLA will shoot up an additional 76% in the next 3 months.

*  On Chinese EV side of things, NIO delivered 7k vehicles in Dec 2020 while XPEV delivered 5,700 vehicles - both numbers are record ""growth"" for the two company which shows a YoY growth of 121% for NIO and 326% for XPEV. (WSB with OTM FDs know these ""growth"" well as their FDs goes from 100% in value but are still down all-time of at -85%). NIO closed the day up 9.75% to $53.49 and XPEV trimmed their intraday high of 10%+ to close up 2.97% at $44.10.

*  In WSB meme stock land, things are a fairly mixed bag as GME continues to fade after reaching a recent 52-week high of $22.35. The definitely-not-going-bankrupt gaming retailer closed the day down -8.44% to $17.25. PLTR, despite being up more than 2% in pre-market, closed the day relatively flat at -0.76% to $23.37. Finally, steel gang got a respite today as MT closed the day up 4.59%, though intraday high was up as much as 8%.

*  Looking for cheap and relatively ""responsible"" WSB meme stock play? You can do GME covered call and sell April 35c for about $1.6 (though selling on a green day for $2+ is probably a better idea). This will net you 100 shares of GME for less than $15.70 per share and cap your imaginary gains at $35 if the squeeze does happen. (All those GME DDs can't be wrong?)  Conversely, you can go with GME April 20c/35c debit call spread for a ""low price"" of $2.4 per spread, or for those who prefer to sell FDs to fellow WSBer, poor man's covered call of Jan 2022 $25c and selling weeklies and/or April 35c will suffice. At the end of the day, the fact that April 35c has so much value still to it should be taken advantage if GME has a green day. For MT, June debit call spread is probably the way to go, with 25c/35c a possible spread. These are not financial advice and if you listen to a random stranger online and lose your pants on the play - then that's on you, you dumb stupid motherfucker.

*  DJI closed down -382 pts (-1.25%), IXIC closed down -189 pts (-1.47%), SPX -55 pts (-1.48%), and RUT is down -28 pts (-1.47%). Notable numbers and ERs this week: ISM manufacturing index tomorrow at 10 AM ET, BBBY reports on Thursday before market opens while MU reports after market close. Load up on those MU 90c for 7/20 - this time it'll definitely hit!

So why exactly does a Blue Wave spell trouble for tech companies?

A couple reasons: more fiscal spending, higher inflation expectations, higher interest rates, less valuable long-term cashflows, tech trade crowding, and hedge fund leverage. Let me explain.

&#x200B;

**Fiscal Spending, Inflation, and Interest Rates**

Generally speaking, Democratic policy favors a large government budget, and with hopes to spend over¬†$5T on clean energy/infrastructure, education, and healthcare Biden's team isn't breaking from the mold. A blue wave would make it much easier for the Biden administration to enact these policies. While Biden is planning on increasing taxes by $3.4T to offset his spending, the government still needs to create money to finance these projects, which¬†leads to inflation. Moreover, the Fed has taken a newly lax stance on its price stability mandate, and is¬†welcoming inflation of more than 2%, so it won't hesitate to let prices run hot to achieve its inflation target. 10 yr bond yields (and interest rates broadly) tend to be highly correlated to measures of inflation, as its a natural way to dampen the acceleration of rising prices.¬†

Summary: dem sweep = higher fiscal spending = higher inflation = higher interest rates

**How This Affects Tech Stock Valuation**

For all the retards who have never taken a finance course or don't understand basic valuation techniques, the essence of stock valuation is projecting future free cash flows and discounting them back at a risk adjusted rate (b/c $1 is worth more today than $1 five yrs from now, and there's not 100% certainty in the CFs the company might produce in the future). Thus, the main determinant of a company's value is its profitability, the rate at which you discount the company's cash flows, and the time horizon you analyze it at (which can be related to the discount rate). For those actually interested, you can read more¬†here. With the current fed funds rate pinned between 0% and .25% and the 10yr yield less than 1%, you can practically look out at a time horizon of 10-20 years before discounting back cash flows. Though still a stretch, interest rates at this level might be able to justify some of the 30-50x price/sales multiples we see in certain growthy tech names at the moment (DDOG's, CRWD's, etc).¬†

That said, if interest rates do begin to rise as a result of a blue sweep, and analysts are forced to incorporate risk free rates of 2-3+% into their discount rates at time horizons where these companies generate little profit, tech companies could see their valuation multiples deteriorate by 50+%. Even just pre-Covid valuation multiples for some growthy names would absolutely crush their stock price. I understand Covid brought forward significant demand for tech companies and in many ways permanently altered consumer behavior, but much of the rise of these companies is based on pure multiple expansion on the basis of forward revenues (not even earnings!), assuming low discount rates and near-infinite time horizons.¬†

**Crowded Long Tech Trade**

It's no real surprise, but according to a December BofA survey, the long technology strategy is the most popular/crowded among fund managers. Also, a year-end Morgan Stanley report indicated that hedge fund gross and net exposure was near all-time highs at 100% and 96%ile, respectively.

**A Quick Note on Leverage**

Hedge funds use leverage to amplify returns, and when leverage is cheap (see above), they are more keen to do so. If a hedge fund is levered at 2x, it has $100 of capital to support $200 of positions. A 10% drawdown would leave the fund with $80 of capital to support $180 of positions, with a new leverage multiple of 2.25x. If this were to happen, the fund would have to sell roughly 20% of its book to maintain its leverage ratio. In such a crowded trade, selling like this would cause another fund to liquidate a portion of its holdings to not become over levered, and this self-sustaining cycle of selling persists. An example of this price action and positive feedback loop is the ""Quant Quake"" of 2007 though its trade was less crowded and firms were probably more highly levered.

**Conclusion/TLDR**

A blue wave and higher interest rates (or even the fear/expectation thereof) could quickly unravel the long technology trade due to its crowding, leverage, and a newfound preference for shorter duration cash flows, crushing the stock prices of many tech companies, especially those that are unprofitable in the near term.

This is **Catholic School The Play** casted by Melvin as the priest and all you dipshit retards are signing up to be the altar boys. Why don't you just bend over right here and willingly spread your ass cheeks until all your spare change falls out of your pockets?

Stop being so scared of a couple red days. Our brothers in arms over in Palantir have been fighting by our side for like a month and all you dumbfuck paper handed bitches start crying after taking a few shots. Get used to some red. Like your wife's boyfriend says, ""I don't mind ketchup on my hot dog as long as the bun is tight."" Well we know you small peckered bitch boys didn't cause anything to loosen up so we know he's telling the truth. Guess fucking what? THIS GME BUN IS SO FUCKING TIGHT IT'S GONNA SQUEEZE LIKE NOTHING YOU'VE SEEN BEFORE. Yeah, get ready for some blood red ketchup and keep jamming it forward. If you can't do that, go check out r/investing and leave your shriveled up raisin nuts on my desk as you head out. 

What do we all have in common? We are so fucking retarded that we can't even be reasoned with. Of all things to be afraid of, you guys are shitting your depends about a dude named Melvin. He might as well have been named Pubert because obviously his parents hate him. 

Who wins a war? A dude with a name as bad as Melvin, or a bunch of Wendy's fueled brainless retards chasing tendies with absolutely no concept of risk management? The answer is obviously us. We are so fucking stupid that nobody can calculate our moves. We are an unpredictable force. Instead of using TA or market sentiment, we just say ""hUrr DuRr StOnkS OnLy Go UP. Wow, I know 2 of those letters! All in for these FD's"" while we are pissing in a bottle and preparing to jerk off for the 8th time since breakfast. 

What we don't have in brains, we also don't have in capital. What we do have though, is something special. We are in a fight with somebody even stupider than us. They stand to lose more money than it would cost for your wife to be exclusive to you. 

Now for the final fucking time. Go change your diaper, prep for some ketchup on this tight bun and squeeze everything your absolutely retarded dimwit ass can find into GME shares. Stop getting cucked by Melvin and bitching about it left and right. We don't even have to say pleas, GME WILL FUCKING FLY AGAIN.

Buffett all the way back at $86.6b (time to BTFD on Buffett??)

Jack Ma at $50.1b, although much of that will probably be spent on his funeral when üçØ üêª finally announces his death.

Time for WSB to pump that price up - just need one  ‚Äústock price is too high‚Äù tweet from Elon, a capital raise to dilute the shares and perhaps another split so we can hit $420 once again and he will be the richest man on this planet.

Perhaps after he becomes the richest person alive, he can finally concentrate on helping Tesla become more profitable than a kids lemonade stand.

DOW got further lifted by action from BA, GS, CVX, and INTC (who's really only being carried by MU). Small caps eclipsed SPX and IXIC today with RUT/IWM up as high as almost 2% during intraday high as value play starts looking more appealing. RUT closed up 1.7% and IWM closed up 1.61%.

* ""I'm totes not dead."" Says Jack Ma, according to a person familiar with the situation who's relaying the info to a CNBC  reporter on Ma's whereabouts. The beleaguered CEO who's in the crosshair of the CCP is keeping it easy and out of the limelight after running afoul of his overlords by talking up CCP's heavy handed action towards Ant Group. Who knew if your fucking financial empire touches the livelihood of 90% of the country there may be consequences if you don't toe the line. BABA closed the day up 5.51% to $240. Meanwhile, PDD touches new ATH and closed the day up 12.24% to $187 while JD is up 10.61% to $95.

* Many underlying in the Chinese ADR/ADS sector also gets a lift today partly thanks to NYSE's overnight about-face on delisting Chinese Telecoms. BILI hits new ATH and closed up 8.15% to $102.46 thanks to favorable reception from their secondary listing on the Heng Sheng while TCEHY closed the day up 5.23% to $76.66.

* Semi sector is on a run today thanks to MU, with Citi upping the NAND and DRAM manufacturer from Sell all the way up to Buy with a PT of freaking $100 as we enter another cyclical season. RBC Capital also raised PT from $57 to $83, Deutsche Bank from $75 to $83. Will MU $90 be back in favor and no longer a meme strike? Find out later this week. F in the chat for MartyMoho. If only he bought fooking shares and ride through two more additional cyclical season and a global pandemic. Ez dub. MU closed up 4.33% to $77, LRCX closed up 3.46% to $494, and AMAT closed up 3% to $89. MU reports earnings later this Thursday after market close.

* GM popped 2% when news broke at 10:29 on positive US sales number from Q4, and while shares were fading slightly as the market digest the news, eventually the positive momentum took over and shares closed the day up 2.84% to $41.66. ROKU pop to close up 5.44%, closing at $335 thanks to WFC analyst raising PT from $275 to $414 (yep) and keeping his overweight rating. 

* Today's big movers: FUBO was up as high as 21%, ~~M-A-R-A was up as high 23% while B-N-G-O drilled more than -30% during intraday lows after an initial halt in the early mornings.~~ FUBO closed up 12.83% to $27.35, ~~M-A-R-A closed up 23.43% to $13.59, and B-N-G-O closed down -31.25% to $4.95~~.

* The GA run-off election is on the market mindset as voters are heading to the polls. Meanwhile, Congress is set to confirm Biden's win over Trump, a procedural formality that generally receives little news coverage but not in the current timeline. Expect POTUS to rage over Pence on Twitter later tonight if the latter confirms Biden's Electoral College win. Look to weed and clean energy sector for pops if the Dems somehow wins both seat. No doubt many WSBer have already loaded up on FDs to showcase the sick gains porn tomorrow if the magic happens.

* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR is up more than 5% but those with OTM Jan 15 calls are likely having their ass handed to them by the greeks, while a similar story exist over at GME as the stock fades away morning gain to close the day up 0.70% as theta rampage $20c, $22c, and $23c (if your strike is even further out then RIP to you). MT and steel gang are faring better, with the stock retaking yesterday's high and closed up 2.84% to 24.63. Steel prices continues to rip and earnings will be early next month on Feb 11th.

* Affirm, the online installment loan lender for Americans who can't fucking afford whatever they're buying, is planning to IPO by offering 24 mil shares at $33 to $38 per share. With a market value of $9 bil, AFRM is sure to be a new meme stock in the coming days.

* The DOW closed up 167 pts to 0.55%, Nasdaq up 120 pts to 0.95%, S&P up 26 pts to 0.71%, and RUT closed up 33 pts to 1.71%. Notable numbers tomorrow: ADP employment report at 8:15 AM ET, factory orders at 10 AM ET, EIA draw at 10:30 AM, and FOMC minutes at 2PM ET.

Basically, it seems like there is a ton of naked short selling going on and no one is doing anything about it. Thus, I propose a complaint campaign to get someone (cough, perhaps a government body who was designed to look into shit just like this, cough) to do something.

We can submit complaints here:

[https://www.sec.gov/tcr](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)

There is literally an exact category for this (""Manipulation of a Security"" and then select ""Abusive Naked Short Selling"").

I'm a simpleton autist, I don't get fancy with my words but I've drafted a basic letter here that you can use:

*To whom it may concern,*

*This letter serves to bring the SEC‚Äôs attention to suspected illegal activity in GameStop Corporation‚Äôs (ticker GME) trading. As a shareholder in GME, I have concerns about illegal naked short selling and increasing failure-to-deliver rates in the month of December 2020 through present day. GME has consistently appeared on the NYSE Threshold Security list for the last 18 trading days. In order to appear on the threshold list, a stock has to have 0.05% of outstanding shares fail-to-deliver, for GameStop this amounts to roughly 350,000 shares.* ***GME‚Äôs failure to-delivery rates have exceed this amount on most trading days in December 2020***\*.\* ***Furthermore, on at least three trading days in December,*** ***the total number of shares failed-to-deliver exceeded 1 million***\*. Below is a summary of trading days in December which had exceptionally high failures-to-deliver:\*

*12/1: 91,971 @ $16.56*

*12/2: 1,061,397 @ $15.80*

*12/3: 1,787,191 @ $16.58*

*12/4: 999,475 @ $16.12*

*12/7: 1,002,379 @ $16.90*

*12/8: 872,292 @ $16.35*

*12/9: 721,361 @ $16.94*

*12/10: 605,975 @ $13.66*

*12/11: 880,063 @ $14.12*

*12/14: 284,296 @ $13.31*

*Given the data presented above, I request the SEC to further investigate suspected illegal naked short-selling in GME, particularly as it concerns Melvin Capital, who holds a substantial short position in the Company.*

Now as an autist, I don't even know if I've fully got the concept down but I think I'm close enough. Would love feedback if anyone with a big brain has any.

TLDR: Big money is playing illegal games on GME. We need to bring that shit to light

I made it clear in the message that the SEC adopted the rules on naked short selling after the GFC of 2008, hopefully to get some journalist wet with click-baity anticipation, drawing a direct line of Wall Street incompetence from then to now.

Interesting. We all obviously know it wont compete with what AMD has performance wise, but if it has a decent pricing on it, it might be interesting to short some calls on it.

Might top at 60$ by Spring (and will surely crash right down)

Chuck wants to buy a 50% share in Sneeds Banana Stand. Chuck asks himself, what is a reasonable price to pay for half of this banana stand?

If Chuck paid $500 for half of the Banana Stand:

* Total Banana Stand market value: $1000
* Total Banana Stand earnings for last fiscal year: $365
* Price to profit ratio (P/E ratio): 2.73
* Time to recoup his $500 investment: 2.73 years

Chuck is willing to take on a little more risk than this. Hell, this Banana Stand really shows a lot of promise! And Sneed, well, Sneed is like a genius! He had a great Banana Stand over on the other side of town that sold tons of bananas. What if Chuck paid ... $25,000 ?

* Total Banana Stand market value: $50,000
* Total Banana Stand earnings for last fiscal year: $365
* P/E ratio: 137
* Time to recoup his $25,000 investment: 137 years.

Chuck doesn't expect to hold his investment for 137 years. He believes that what's really important is not the money coming into the Banana Stand, but rather how other people like Chuck *feel* about the Banana Stand. See chuck is a growth investor - not a value investor.

Chuck feels really good about the future of this Banana Stand. It's only making $1 a day right now, but man Sneed is going to take this Stand places. Chuck decides to go all in and pay $289,080 for a 50% share in the Banana Stand.

* Total Banana Stand market value: $578,160
* Total Banana stand earnings for last fiscal year: $365
* P/E ratio: 1584
* Time to recoup his $289,080 investment: 1584 years

Of course for Americans it's a surreal time.

/r/wallstreetbets is proudly a non political sub, as made very evident by Rule #5 :

>"" If you choose to start arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door. ""

Still, during the peak of the political shithousery, the mods created that thread to allow political discussions made me believe that the mods are not just robotic overlords that don't understand the needs of the average retard. I believe this demonstrated better leadership than many of our political overlords, and any /r/wallstreetbets mod running for office will have a vote from this retard.

Also looking at the discussion happening on that thread and even in other threads (such as the Daily Discussion ones), I was amazed at how civil, absolutely hilarious, and particularly autistic the discussion was. This reflects the values of our community, and I'm proud of each and every one of you.

I just wanted to make a post to congratulate the mods for doing an amazing work at managing a bunch of retards who sniff more crayons than an Elementary school teacher, and show my appreciation for my fellow retards who managed to find humor in the crazy times we live in.

I am proud to call myself a /r/wallstreetbets retard.

That's all I got.

APHA 1/15 10c - loooooking good.

GOEV 1/15 25c - got ass fucked

So far, the majority of the picks are small caps so I can‚Äôt publish them here based on the sub's rules. However, I still want to share with you all the higher caps that were surfaced.

**For y‚Äôall degenerates, just skip those next paragraphs and go straight to the picks. For y‚Äôall nerds who want to understand a thing or two about my program, keep on reading.**

* My program, built on Python, scans Reddit and Twitter and bubbles up stocks that just started generating conversations. So we‚Äôre not talking about the over discussed stocks like TSLA, PLTR, PLUG and such. We‚Äôre talking about the next ones.
* I‚Äôve been beta testing and tweaking the tool for the past year and although, there is room for improvement, it has allowed me to spot and pick up stocks such as PLUG, PENN or NET really early (bought in respectively at $3, $10 and $20) solely based on the tool‚Äôs insights.

**Ok, now that this is clear for everyone, here‚Äôs how to interpret the stock picks.**

* The percentage increase (+%) is based on a WoW (week on week) analysis. That means I am comparing mentions of a stock/ticker from one week to the previous week. I also use MoM and YoY data to inform the picks (a stock might surface this week based on big news but it might have been mentioned over and over during the year, which means it wouldn‚Äôt be considered an ‚Äúemerging stock‚Äù based on my model).
* The ‚ÄúReasoning‚Äù I provide is based on a light research I do on my own before highlighting any of the program‚Äôs picks in order to understand why they‚Äôre generating conversation. If I find out that they are based on a PnD, I filter the stocks out. If I have any doubt, I filter them out too but will mention them at the bottom of the results so people can form their own opinions.

**Warning**: I am a programmer, not a financial analyst. My goal is to share with you the results my program provides, not recommend any buys.

**Enough said, here‚Äôs the (small) list!**

**Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT) +670%**

Market Cap: $6.5bn

Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, focuses on the discovery and development of RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy, and other genetic therapeutic modalities approaches for the treatment of rare diseases.

Reasoning: The stock tanked 51% on Friday due to mixed test results on a gene therapy targeting muscular dystrophy. Note that they have 43 different therapies in their pipeline and 1 received mixed results so far. ARKG owns SRPT and reacted to the news by buying +700k shares.

**Magna International (MGA) +436%**

Market Cap: $22.7bn

Magna International Inc. designs, engineers, and manufactures components, assemblies, systems, subsystems, and modules for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of vehicles and light trucks worldwide. Clients include Aston Martin, BMW, Ford, Daimler, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubish, Peugeot, Citroen, Renault, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo.

Reasoning: LG and Magna partnered to electrify powertrains last week. Rumors have now spread that Magna could potentially become the manufacturer of Apple‚Äôs new car.

Disclaimer: I do not currently own any shares in SRPT. I own shares in MGA.

As the title says I have a trading bot which I spent a long while developing.

There are two batches of codes which I run alongside each other.

Batch 1 and Batch 2.

Batch 1 uses some of the judgement of myself and calculations to gather stock.

Batch 2 is just purely calculations which release values which say if it‚Äôs worth doing a call, or not worth doing a call.

Past few days the top picks with NVDA, and a small cap  I can post this daily if you guys are interested.

This the data which I have acquired on Sunday (NY) 10th of January 2021, based on the close of the last business day.

Here‚Äôs an update to my trading bot. QS looks tempting but I think I can hold off until tomorrow a better company I understand comes on sight.

Only invest in companies you know and have a understanding of and can see they have a future, to lessen any potential losses via trading.

&#x200B;

**Key:**

* Pharma companies are very risky.
* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.
* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.
* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).
* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.
* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.
* Take the ""Calls"" as very discounted, and ""Potentially A Call"" as somewhat discounted.
* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.
* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.
* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Code Batch 1:**

* Quantumscape Corp (QS) - Hype stock, Solid State Battery - High Risk
* AYI Acuity Brands, Inc.
* ADS Alliance Data Systems Corporation

**Code Batch 2:**

Edit 1: there might be companies which you haven‚Äôt heard of, this is due to me adding the SPY 500 companies into it to increase data output.

EDIT 2: I‚Äôm not charging anyone for this data and no you cannot buy it - I worked too hard to get it right. I‚Äôll be giving daily updates for it.

Edit 3: My goal is to do 400 successful trades with minimum losses before I say everything perfect.

Edit 8: Over 100 people have seen this, I feel like it‚Äôs my birthday. I love you guys. I just want everyone to be well off and have money.

Edit 9: 168 upvotes I just can‚Äôt imagine I would‚Äôve ever got this, you guys are amazing. But please just invest in companies you know and are confident about. That‚Äôs all I ask, I‚Äôm waiting for a big tech company to be discounted enough to show up that‚Äôs where I would drop 20-40k into it. Only invest in the things you are personally confident about. I‚Äôll be posting this everyday, stocks are a waiting game keep in mind.

Edit 10: 200 UPVOTES WHAT THATS CRAZY!!!  Thank you so much for all the awards, you guys really don‚Äôt have to, please spend that money on stocks and such. It‚Äôs very expensive.

Edit 11: 453 upvotes I just don‚Äôt know what to say you guys are amazing I‚Äôm trying to perfect everything for you guys, but please don‚Äôt rush to do trades everyday only trades which you are confident on. Thank you WSB I will be a loyal member to the community.

Edit 12: I just ate and came back and it‚Äôs almost at a thousand. You guys have just made my day especially the upvotes and awards which I given. You guys are the absolute best and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without you. Please read my messages above carefully. I don‚Äôt want you guys to lose money and PLEASEEE AWARDS ARE EXPENSIVE DONT WASTE MONEY ON ME PUT IT TOWARDS STOCKS INSTEAD HAHAHA BUT HONESTLY THANK YOU GUYS.

Edit 13: Tomorrow I‚Äôll update the tickers to companies which have a larger market cap and doesn‚Äôt go sideways half the time. This includes removing boomer companies. As some of the companies are pretty obsolete in today‚Äôs market, to the point its likely not in view of many others and I. I‚Äôll revolve it more around myself.  I‚Äôll remove many of the SPY500/boomer companies next update so expect the list to be shorter. With batch 2 it‚Äôll be hard but batch 1 it can be done fairly easily.

Edit 14: Ban for one day on WSB, can‚Äôt post will post Monday update on the other sub in my post history. /r/wallstreettrader , my bot is designed only for WSB.

Therefore, DJIA inclusion  could be an equivalent or bigger deal. Right now I see three  underperforming companies in the DJIA that are likely to be removed due  to them no longer representing the American economy in the future. This  includes Intel, IBM, and Boeing.

* Intel is about to outsource to TSMC and become a foreign company
* IBM is stuck in the last century and still widely hated for ruining chess for everyone
* Boeing is about to turn into a defense only company because they killed all their consumers

There  seems to be little information on how and when a company is added to  the Dow Jones Industrial Average list of 30 companies. I tried searching  [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dow-30.asp) and [spglobal](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/dow-jones-industrial-average/#overview), but found no indication on when they decide to add new companies to the list.

This  lack of information is very suspicious to me and indicates Tesla may be  added to the DJIA very soon. Looking at huge Tesla jumps in the near  future.

Edit: I got some very concerning positive feedback in the comments. Please only be negative as this is not sound investment advice and should not be mistaken as advice in any form."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001802.csv|StockTicker|['DJIA']|[]|['DJIA', 'I', 'DJIA', 'IBM', 'TSMC', 'IBM', 'I', 'DJIA', 'I']|['IBM', 'IBM']

I‚Äôve seen SO many ‚ÄúGurus‚Äù show up this year on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and god knows what other platforms

All claiming they made really great returns but just started trading this year....in March...literally at the bottom of the market.

Please don‚Äôt listen to these guys

People who‚Äôve made all their money on one or two stocks from just throwing money at the literal bottom of the market don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about

I know this seems obvious but man I‚Äôve seen so many, and just today I had my brother in law tell him his barber was giving him day trading advice

I've been lurking for some time, finally made an account on Reddit a month ago (not a boomer, I just don't use much social media or related websites) and now I can post. As many of you are probably watching right now, PLUG just flew up to 71.20 AH, and will probably continue its climb as we approach Biden's inauguration. Like many of you, I saw it a week ago in the 30s, watched it soar, and got too scared to FOMO in.

However, a fellow retard dropped the ticker ""BLDP"" in the daily comment section about a week ago, and I decided to YOLO in and buy some Jan15 30C and Feb19 32C. Surely enough, the retard came through, and the stock soared. Nothing too crazy, but daily returns comparable to FCEL/PLUG. Next thing I know, I wake up this morning and find out that my BLDP calls were +500% and +300, respectively, so I ran to the wife's bedroom, asked her boyfriend to help me clean the shit out of my pants that the 5-bagger caused, and then I paper handed and sold for some fat gains (will provide screenshots if people like). Throughout the day, it was sideways with a couple dips, so sure enough, I YOLO'd back in for some Jan15 35C and Feb19 40C.

Now, here we are, and although PLUG may be up 8% AH and everyone is scared to FOMO in, BLDP is only up 7.71% AH (a steal, I know), and it's only going higher. Don't be the paper handed pussy that your wife hates and her boyfriend laughs at. BLDP is heading to the fucking moon \*moon emoji\* \*moon emoji\* \*moon emoji\* \*moon emoji\*, and then to Mars from there. Oh, did I mention that PLUG and FCEL have daily volumes of 90M+, while BLDP is still under 20M? Just wait for the boomers to find out about it....

Anyways, I don't really have any DD, so do with this information what you will. I'm going to diamond hands this shit like I am with my ICLN, and Biden is going to take me straight to tendie town.

TLDR; My positions are BLDP Jan15 35C and Feb19 40C. TBH, it'll probably hit 40 tomorrow or Thursday, once Biden's frail voice hypes up the future of energy.

Edit: Someone asked for tendies, so here you are sir.

Here's a list of trades [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cZ2rNqW123eTj7rapyWNWC-zHEaLs79njlHEIJRY1\_U/edit#gid=199204529](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cZ2rNqW123eTj7rapyWNWC-zHEaLs79njlHEIJRY1_U/edit#gid=199204529)

My ROI from swing-trading over the last 45 days is almost 50%. Small peepee, I know, but gains is gains.

If I just kept adding more GME shares to my portfolio over the last 45 days (buy and hold), my ROI would be less than 15%.

***I don't know about you, but I want 50% more money, not 15% more money.***

So, if we ignore the short-term taxes (pain in the ass), there's a case to be made for ***some*** swing trading AKA paperhanding. Especially with such an obviously manipulated stock like GME (no doubt it's getting suppressed. Fuck Melvin. Fuck BofA.)

But, it gotta be done smartly. Let's quickly go over some examples

**SCENARIO 1**

Monday, January 11 2021 - the awesome news of Daddy Cohen joining the Board of Directors, paired with the really meh holiday sales report was an obvious signal the stock is gonna experience some drastic moves. We all know what happened - solid volume, but we slammed into that $20.6 wall, then we took a few steps back only to get stuck at $20.5 again and then it was over. Solid 12.7% green day in the end.

But, nobody really knew what was gonna happen, before it happened. This is the time where you üíéüëê, because there's way too many variables to predict where the price will go and where it will end. if it goes $2+ up, you don't sell, if it goes $2 down, you don't sell. Just hold and let the dust settle. Stonk will eventually go up anyway, so no need to rush anything.

I personally held 312 GME bags since December 31 - that's a lot of painful red days before yesterday for me.

**SCENARIO 2**

Today, Tuesday, January 12 2021 - Not the best day for üßªüëê swing trading, but pattern got established early on... After getting rejected at $20.6 and $20.5 the day before, [it didn't even manage to break $20.4 today](https://prnt.sc/wm5r8u), then it was [followed by the $20.25 ceiling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kvwpxg/gme_autists_preparing_to_break_the_2025_ceiling/). I sold at $20.17 (bought at $19.01 on December 31, remember?). The price was pretty bouncy after I sold, but volume was low, so the price wasn't moving up or down too much despite big swings in RSI. Therefore, I concluded it was not gonna fall much below $19.78 for the rest of the day. It fell to $19.73 IIRC, but I bought at $19.78.

***Without spending a single extra cent out of my own pocket, I now own more GME shares than at the start of the trading day.***

Tomorrow, I will observe if the price upswing gets rejected again and look to sell at $20.3, maybe $20.4, immediately in the first trading hour after market opens. Then, I'll watch and see if we get a massive sell off like today and buy the dip.

If the price upswing doesn't get rejected, instead it continues climbing above $20.4 and breaks the $20.6 wall tomorrow, I will not sell, instead I will üíéüëê. However, unless we get some good news, tomorrow will probably be meh like today.

**SCENARIO 3**

Monday, January 4 2021 - You're an idiot like me and you buy at $19.01 on December 31 2020. Come Monday, the price plummets all the way down to $17.1 or whatever it was. Red day, bloody as fuck. Do you üßªüëê, or do you üíéüëê?

The answer is obvious, ***you wipe your ass with diamonds until your ass and the shit coming out of it bleed as well.***

That's what I did. It hurt. But I didn't sell, I held. Reward finally came today when I sold for a decent profit, and then used that profit to buy the dip.

More shares, more gains.

POSITION: europoor 318 shares at $19.78 as of today

I‚Äôve taken some time to do my own DD on GME and sharing it with you, in addition to all the other great DD out there. I‚Äôm going to cover shorts, debt, and what I think might accelerate GME‚Äôs mission to Mars.

**TL:DR;** GME is a ticking time bomb. Shorts R Fuk. Buy shares, Sell puts to acquire shares cheaper. Buy leaps on red days. No idea what's gonna happen in the very short term but 2021 will be massive.

# About the Shorts

So, updated short interest came out today. If you haven‚Äôt seen it, shorts **increased** their positions through the end of the year:

&#x200B;

[12\/31 short position update](https://preview.redd.it/k66xyn1oq1b61.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=a61c48086c09a509fe4a7152db90ba4a3c082323)

What. The. Fuck.

I really can‚Äôt figure out the macro logic here because from the outside it looks like they‚Äôre digging their own graves.

On the day-to-day scale, I think I understand how this is happening. If you look at the days with a high short volume ratio, the narrative is clear: Shorts are actively trying to defend GME crossing 20 significantly, and coming in hard when threatened. Shorts also took advantage of general market selloff on Jan 4 to push GME down.

&#x200B;

[Days with heavy shorting activity](https://preview.redd.it/dir3ss9sq1b61.png?width=1175&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d0859c5aff4dce709a27b945786507ba9c4de18)

This is also why GME ended up ***only*** \~12% after the recent RC announcement. Short volume was a whopping **4MM** shares on that day.

The problem is shorts are doing all this active shorting to defend their existing short positions, but they‚Äôre either not able or not choosing to close all of the intraday shorting, so it‚Äôs accumulating. As of 12/31 the **total short positions (71.2M) exceed total issued shares (69.75M).**

# The precarious position of the shorter

Shorts find themselves in a very precarious position. Let‚Äôs talk about the float and DTC (days-to-close). **The DTC number you see above is a lie.** There‚Äôs an argument to be made that **DTC is infinity.**

There are a total of 69.75M shares issued by GME. According to [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kw0djb/gme_floatshort_data/) who has a CapIQ subscription, insiders hold 22.8M shares. I was able to verify using this [nasdaq source](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/insider-activity) that the top insiders hold about 20% of shares:

&#x200B;

[Top Insider Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/id7ppwjvq1b61.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=abc9f4103776787f435ebbe719f5420c776d7ad1)

The thing with insiders is that they can‚Äôt easily sell due to lots of restrictions so they‚Äôre not considered part of the ‚Äúactively‚Äù traded part of the stock. I.e. They can‚Äôt just sell on price action.

In addition to insiders, [**institutions now own 110% of GME shares**](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings)**.** (Thanks shorters!). Some of these institutions may actively trade, but the top holdings (FMR, BlackRock, Vanguard, etc.) *will not trade based on price action* as they are generally holding for their ETFs / index funds that hold GME.

&#x200B;

[Institutional Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/de46p98yq1b61.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b3b9332efb259e72eae6209a3ce1743ed0b462f)

Now, thought experiment. What happens ***if*** shorts decide to cover? They have to buy back 71M shares. Who are they going to buy it back from?

1. They can‚Äôt buy them back from insiders.
2. Let‚Äôs be conservative here, and say that Fidelity, BlackRock, Vanguard will hold on to their shares, but all of the other institutions will paper hand when shorts start to cover. This is very conservative because there are other institutions that hold GME for their own ETFs.

So, 69.75M shares - 22.8M for insiders - 23.43M held by BlackRock/Vanguard/Fidelity = **23.52M shares left.** So fuck all other short-to-float ratios out there, the **short % of tradable float is at least 300%.**

[Investopedia ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daystocover.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways-,Days%20to%20cover%2C%20also%20called%20short%20ratio%2C%20measures%20the%20expected,for%20the%20company%20in%20question.)tells us that days to cover is *‚Äúcalculated by taking the* ***number of currently shorted shares*** *and* ***dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume*** *for the company in question.‚Äù*

GME‚Äôs [20-day average daily volume](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/technical-analysis) is about 10.4M shares, so that‚Äôs about 6.83 days to cover. This, however, is **a lie.** *The DTC definition listed by Investopedia stops making sense when short interest exceeds purchasable float.*

Math whiz‚Äôs out there‚Ä¶ if you have to buy 71M shares from a pool of 23.5M shares, and GME‚Äôs daily volume is 11M shares a day, how many days will it take to cover?

Answer: **Infinity. You can‚Äôt. You can never cover.** There literally are not enough shares to buy to close your shorts. You can only buy-to-close 23.5M shares, and that‚Äôs even if you can convince all of them to sell (i.e. $$$$$). **True DTC is Infinity.** This is part of the reason shorts haven‚Äôt covered. *There‚Äôs no way out of the burning building they‚Äôre in.*

# How it gets worse part 1) Institutional Buying

Here‚Äôs how it gets worse. Besides all the retards like you and me buying GME b/c of Lord Cohen and u/DeepFuckingValue, GME is about to cross some serious thresholds that make it attractive to more institutional buying.

First, in the recent [Q4 numbers](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results) release:

* ‚ÄúThe Company is continuing to suspend guidance, however, unless further unforeseen COVID-19 related impacts occur, it expects to realize positive comparable store sales results and **profitability** in the fiscal fourth quarter.

So, GME is about to cross into the positive EPS category, which in addition to the debt story below is going to potentially **unlock** **more institutional buying** that is currently blocked by rules like not investing in companies with negative P/E.

Second, let‚Äôs talk about debt.

## Debt

Businesses leverage debt to scale; particularly true with retail businesses that have to pay for inventory in advance of selling it. High cost of debt -> lower profits -> lower ability to pay debt -> higher debt costs, and the cycle continues. On the flipside, if GME was able to increase its credit rating, you get lower debt costs, higher profitability, which leads to higher credit rating, etc.

I believe we‚Äôre seeing a campaign from GME to pay down debt to reduce a) restrictive covenants in the 2021 notes (preventing things like more share buybacks) and b) upgrade their bonds to investment grade.

Not only will a credit upgrade lead to cheaper debt, it will **unlock more institutional investment that are currently restricted against buying equities with below-investment-grade debt ratings.**

## Debt

* Debt was $472MM up until July 2020

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l87lqgtwr1b61.png?width=1069&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c897cd39f4b8874839fcdf602802cf015d78b22

* GME announced a voluntary pre-payment of $125MM of debt ([link](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/10/2124246/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Voluntary-Early-Redemption-of-Senior-Notes.html)) that will happen 3 days after the earnings call (earnings Dec 8, debt repayment Dec 11)... ‚Äú**using cash generated from operations to reduce our outstanding debt‚Äù**

## Debt rating:

* First, take a look at GME‚Äôs bond pricing. GME‚Äôs bonds were significantly impacted by the March crash. However, GME‚Äôs bond pricing has recovered and is now **trading at par**, meaning the market believes that GME will pay back its debt (i.e. not a bankruptcy risk).

&#x200B;

[GME Bonds trading at par](https://preview.redd.it/cu6rpvpur1b61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cd2fd2376d717c198e65aa7d9f22ed4ec77b853)

* Now, look at its Moody‚Äôs rating history. First, for context, anything under a Baa3 rating is considered junk (ratings chart here) and greatly affects who can buy your bonds and what types of rates you get.

&#x200B;

[Moody's debt ratings. GME currently sits at B3](https://preview.redd.it/56e3ba82s1b61.png?width=867&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1f56f076c11f01204a1086b43670a5a48ab7f30)

Here are Moody‚Äôs actions on GME ([source](https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/GameStop-Corp-credit-rating-808528072)). In particular:

* Downgrade on 5/2019 to Ba2
* Downgrade on 1/2020 to B2
* Downgrade on 4/2020 to Caa1
* Upgrade on 7/2020 to B3

&#x200B;

[GME upgraded to B3 in Jul 2020](https://preview.redd.it/menraih6s1b61.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=da868433f2546ffe1c5ce3294e48559d9f03e256)

## Speculation on debt:

* GME is working with Moody‚Äôs & others to get credit rating back to Investment grade. Showing **positive earnings/profitability** and **paying back debt early** is key to this. I believe we should see an upgrade soon to at least Baa3 (the lowest level of investment-grade debt).
* The market is not generally considering GME‚Äôs debt as risky as Moody‚Äôs credit rating would suggest. The market can move faster than Moody‚Äôs.

Positive EPS + Debt ratings upgrade = massive institutional buying = shorts further in the hole.

# How it gets worse part 2) Passive Buying Feedback Loop

GME is part of [62 ETFs holding about 10.7M shares](https://www.etf.com/stock/GME) in addition to a whole bunch in index funds (not ETFs). I couldn‚Äôt get a number for index funds but am going to estimate around 10M for them as well given the Vanguard/Fidelity numbers above.

More than 50% of these holdings are passive, **market-cap weighted funds**. Now here‚Äôs the feedback loop that really fucks the short story up.

1. Institutions buy GME ->
2. Price goes up ->
3. Market Cap Goes up ->
4. Weight in Funds Goes up ->
5. ETFs buy more GME for every $ of inflow ->
6. Price goes up -> return to step 3

At $20, GME is already up >5x from its low of \~$4 in 2020. This means that for every $1 thrown into IWM, for example, Blackrock is putting 5x as much of that $1 into GME as it was back at GME‚Äôs lows. As GME‚Äôs price goes up, **any market-cap weighted fund puts more money into GME for every $1 of inflow.**

The passive feedback loop has already started. It will really kick into high gear with institutional buying.

# Other speculations:

1. I believe RC is already slated to be CEO, and this will be announced in the June 2021 annual shareholder meeting.
   1. This is why the ICR presentation was pulled. RC didn‚Äôt want the content in the ICR presentation to be the market-adopted story on the GME strategy.
   2. 3 board members are retiring. I believe this is part of a pre-negotiated deal where RC is taking over. The 3 that are stepping down didn‚Äôt agree with the mgmt change.
2. GME is due for a re-rate of price/sales. GME is currently trading at a P/S of 1 - if you ONLY include the ecommerce revenue. From a total revenue perspective it‚Äôs closer to .2. **GME is currently worth less than its quarterly revenue.** From the [Q4 sales pre-release](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results):
   1. ‚ÄúNet quarterly sales were $1.770 billion‚Äù
   2. ‚ÄúE-Commerce sales, which are included in comparable store sales, rose 309% and represented approximately 34% of total company sales, with total worldwide E-Commerce sales year to date reaching over $1.35 billion, far exceeding the Company‚Äôs $1.0 billion growth objective;‚Äù

At this point, it‚Äôs really the endgame for shorts. They have to find a way to exit before Cohen is CEO.

PLTR. Yet to explode, yet held on by all the same diamond hands of $GME. There‚Äôs a presentation at the end of this month for Palantir and it‚Äôs for showcasing their technology so shareholders and people who haven‚Äôt gotten in yet can better understand the product they‚Äôre providing. Although you don‚Äôt want to get in after the presentation, you need to get in before. If you think that $GME is exploding, just wait because $PLTR is known by everyone. I‚Äôve even heard random idiots at bars talking about it. The amount of diamond üíé hands üñê in PLTR is catastrophic, there‚Äôs no doubt that this company will succeed in the future. 

Lockup.

Lockup period is coming to an end, and shareholders will be selling their stakes. It‚Äôs inevitable, but that‚Äôs why you make a play on PLTR now because the drive up before lockup will be something extraordinary since shareholders will try to maximize their gains upon lockup ending. Take those GME tendies and put them straight back into the market with good ol‚Äô Palantir.

Make some money now, sell before lockup and screw over the shareholders by forcing them to hold their shares once again. The amount of volume upon lockup ending will be tremendous and quite possibly the biggest shit show of 2021. I‚Äôm in for the ride and hope you guys are too.

TL;DR: Presentation end of month = Drive up in stock price. Lockup in early February = Drive up for shareholders to capitalize their gains.

When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one group of traders to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, a decent respect to the opinions of Mad Money and other boomers requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. 

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all autists are created *superior*, that they are endowed by Ryan Cohen and u/deepfuckingvalue with certain unalienable rights, that among these are gamma squeezes, yolos, and the pursuit of Tendies. That to secure these rights, subs are instituted amongst autists, deriving their reetard strength from the consent of Papas Musk, Karp, Cohen, and Cathy. That whenever Wall Street institutions and other boomers become destructive to these ends, it is the RIGHT of the reetards to alter or destroy them, and to institute new management of the market. 

The history of the present market makers and whales is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute TYRANNY over WSB and the autistic everywhere. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. 

* Market elites have instituted day trading restrictions, harming our abilities to harness rapid moves of the market to our advantage 
* They have infiltrated our sub and kept among us in times of peace, lurkers and FUDders to spread discord 
* They have excited boomers against us, and have endeavored to bring upon reetards the merciless SEC savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all autistic savants, from god-king Musk, to the imprisoned Prince Shkreli
* They have declared our sacred meme stocks ""casinos"" 
* They have deliberately lowered price targets when they lose the market advantage to harm retail
* They have limited our abilities to lose our own money, by passing through edict accredited investor limits, putting pressure on Robinhood to halt options approval, and putting a false focus on rIsK mAnAgEmEnT departments
* They have demonized retail traders for the volatility of the market, ignoring the true culprit of monetary debasement and failure to impose stress tests on the market and its participants
* They have imposed taxes on us without our consent

In every stage of these ruthless and evil actions, we have petitioned Cramer and the hotties on MSNBC for redress in the most humble of terms. Our repeated petitions have only been met with repeated restrictions and condescension. 

Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our Boomer ""brethren."" We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their ""smart"" and ""learned"" government, brokers, and accountants to manipulate the market in favor of the connected and the whales. They did not listen. We warned them of paradigm shifts in AMD, Tesla, and Gamestop. THEY HAVE BEEN DEAF TO THE *SCREECHING REEEEES* OF AUTISTIC REASON. We must therefore hold them as we hold the whales and market makers, Enemies in trading, in after hours, friends. 

Wall street can keep their price targets, their analysts, their rules, and their high frequency trading. They can keep their DCFs, their balance sheets, and their provincial focus on rEvEnUe and p/e ratios. Where WSB is going, we have no use for these archaic and backwards millstones, hung around the neck of wage-slave boomers like heavy stones. 

We, therefore, THE UNITED REETARDS AND AUTISTS OF WALL STREET BETS, in general congress, assembled, appealing to the mother of all short squeezes, do, in the name of and by the authority granted by our green dildos, solemnly publish and declare, that these members are, and of right ought to be, FREE AND INDEPENDENT TRADERS, that we are absolved from all power and control from the big banks, Wall Street analysts, and boomer talking heads. And that as FREE AND INDEPENDENT REETARDS, we have the power to set our own price targets, have the power to levy war on Melvin Capital, establish tendies, and to do all other things the autistic do. 

And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of this sub, we mutually pledge OUR LIVES, OUR DD, AND OUR SACRED TENDIES."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001736.csv|StockTicker|['WSB']|[]|['IN', 'GRESS', 'NUARY', 'RIGHT', 'RANNY', 'WSB', 'SEC', 'K', 'T', 'MSNBC', 'AMD', 'THEY', 'HAVE', 'BEEN', 'DEAF', 'TO', 'THE', 'CHING', 'OF', 'ISTIC', 'EASON', 'WSB', 'THE', 'NITED', 'TARDS', 'AND', 'TISTS', 'OF', 'WALL', 'TREET', 'BETS', 'FREE', 'AND', 'NDENT', 'ADERS', 'FREE', 'AND', 'NDENT', 'TARDS', 'OUR', 'LIVES', 'OUR', 'DD', 'AND', 'OUR', 'ACRED', 'NDIES']|['AMD', 'FREE', 'FREE', 'DD']

Listen guys, this a sure MOON. Star Wars is extremely popular but Marvel is on a league on its own. 

On the link attached above is the Top Grossing Films of all time. Disney is the big boss of media. Kids can watch the same movies all over again. 

Another thing: Disney‚Äôs toy and licensing business is a multibillion dollar banger. I dont think people are pricing this in for earnings. Christmas sales must have been through the roof. 

Disney partnership with Ubisoft to make Star Wars games; fans were extremely disappointed with EA and their shitty battlefronts. This means Disney wants to expands their presence even more on the Video Game Industry. Just wait till they start making more game for their multiple franchises. Fucking Mickey Mouse, Toy Story, Marvel and every other game they can make.

^^^^ They started this trend by partnering with Fortnite, you know where kids waste their parents credit card on useless skins? 

And the best for last: Disney‚Äôs only operating half its business, when the parks, cruises and movies get back to normal this will be at least $500.

Today has been an incredible day for us despite the 11% share price drop. I want to use this opportunity to thank everyone for holding their line. Many of us, including myself, have bought more shares today and will continue to do so until we see the actual squeeze happening.

  

### üìÖ This has happened today:

* An annoucement was made that GME board members who are resigning have sold their shares causing today's price drop as a reaction by the market to these news (NEGATIVE but the market came together and held the line to minimize impact)
* Fidelity and Schwab are confirmed to have eliminated margin on $GME (NEUTRAL)
* There is current talk about margin calls going out soon (POSITIVE)
* Uptick rule (SEC 210) is in effect until at least EOD Tuesday (POSITIVE)  


### üîÆ This will happen soon:

* Short sellers will be margin called soon - there is no way around this now
* **We will have another large squeeze**
* GameStop will undergo a huge transformation and capitalize on the ever-growing esports / video game market

&#x200B;

### üêª Melvin and other short sellers

You targeted the wrong firm! You were gambling on 45,000+ people (FT & PT) to loose their jobs as GameStop would slowly go out of business. 

But guess what: after Ryan Cohen bought further into GME this will never happen. The team at RC Ventures will make sure of that. And us, we will hold the line and buy further into it until we get rid of all large short positions. GME is not a dead company, it is just getting started.

**GameStop is here to stay and will undergo an amazing transformation!**

&#x200B;

Note: For everyone who is new to this, please be aware that options have very low impact on share prices and that volatility (among many other things) plays a huge factor in your trades. Be careful with your trades and always do your own due diligence.

PS:  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Positions: 190 shares, 5 1/22 $38c (full reinvestment of my old calls)

TL;DR: Today was a rough day but an amazing setup for the coming week. $GME will go to the moon.

Here's my **personal** DD on PLTR, you're welcome to read and do whatever you want. Other helpful info or pointing out mistakes in my DD is very welcome.

Fears preventing you from buying PLTR

1. Targeted ads on your phone from Yahoo Finance or Zacks telling you PLTR = BAD!!!1!eleven
2. Shills spamming ""pLtR tO tHe MoOn"" and :rocket: on PLTR thread comments.
3. Last quarter's seemingly bad financials/earnings.
4. Financials Moving Forwards
5. Soros who owns 21 million shares ""threatening"" to sell his shares upon DPO expiry.
6. DPO expiry 3 days after February's earnings and possible insiders and DPO holders sale and dip.
7. What does PLTR tldr.
8. Other Information

&#x200B;

***#1 Targeted Ads***

Ads and articles are both paid for by someone.The fact that in the past 3 weeks i've been getting multiple multiple targeted ads on my phone related to PLTR since i love PLTR so much.

Ads are telling me that PLTR is bad, doesn't provide a dividend, they're telling me PLTR's fair price is 20 instead of 25 based on some financial model and have gone as far as to provide a list of alternative stocks to buy.

To me, this all screams: **SCARE TACTICS**

Additionally, the last few weeks of ups and downs in PLTR's stock price is another indication of the attempts to short the stock to sh!t and drive investors out. (For what reason? I don't know.)

&#x200B;

***#2 Shilling PLTR***

I myself love to shill PLTR to people whenever i can. I do this because i legitimately think this company will do great. I work as a product manager in a software development house and understand what PLTR does. PLTR is not cryptic.Regardless, i think when people shill PLTR to you, they are right to do so as you're probably missing out on a great opportunity to make money in the long run. If you're looking for big gains short term, maybe try something else.

Shillery is OK, but at least give the facts.

&#x200B;

***#3 Last Quarter's Bad Financials***

If you'd done your DD not by searching reddit posts but by checking PLTR's actual quarterly report, you'd know that PLTR's ""bad"" last financial quarter/earnings were due to the costs of listing themselves on the *New York Stock Exchange*.\~855million were spent on listing and stock related compensations and this is the big reason.

**Direct quote by PLTR here:** [https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)

>We incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing.

I would like to remind everyone that this is a **1 TIME THING.** Put simply, this means that PLTR won't have as excessive losses next quarter as they did this last quarter.

*Additionally*, let me go into further detail on this and not just leave it to that.

* ***PLTR's quarterly operating expenses for the past 3 quarters were at around \~260 million.***
* ***PLTR's operating expenses this quarter were \~987 million.***

ADDITIONALLY...

PLTR also had a higher R&D cost this quarter that just passed. Normally they'd pay 80 million on R&D, but somehow ended up paying \~300 million this quarter. No one knows why, but this is another thing that influenced PLTR's earnings.

[https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)

>On September 30, 2020, in connection with the Direct Listing, we incurred $769.5 million and $8.4 million of stock-based compensation using the accelerated attribution method related to the satisfaction of the performance-based vesting condition for RSUs and growth units, respectively, that had satisfied the service-based vesting condition as of such date.

&#x200B;

***#4 PLTR financials moving forwards***

PLTR is deep in bed with the government and the Biden regime although may look like it would be against using PLTR is in fact secretly very pro-surveillance e.g pro Palantir.

Here's some of the known organizations in the US Govt that use PLTR:

1. CDC
2. Office of the Secretary
3. Food and Drug Administration
4. Immigration and Customs Enforcements / ICE
5. Internal Revenue Service / IRS
6. National Institute on Drug Abuse
7. DOD/ARMY - ACC Aberdeen Proving Ground
8. Coast Guard / DHS
9. DOD/NAVY - Naval Information Warfare Systems Command
10. US Attorney's Offices / DOJ
11. US Special Operations Command / SPEC OPS

Boys. The big institutional people know these things. You just found this out. See how deep PLTR is already in bed with the Government?????? Palantir IS the next Raytheon/Lockheed of DATA aggregation and visualization.

***UPCOMING EARNINGS***

I've done some quick maths and it looks like PLTR is more likely to be in positive earnings this quarter and with a 0.02 cent EPS target, we can easily assume that they'll destroy this with maybe 0.04 or 0.08 EPS. In the worst case scenario, PLTR's EPS this quarter could be somewhere around MINUS -0.05 ish due to interview costs and ad/campaigning costs that were not there before the company was listed.

***WHAT CAN DESTROY PALANTIR***

Now, there's big possible downsides and Palantir can fail IF contracts that expire are not renewed. That's biggest REAL reason for Palantir's balance sheet getting screwed.

I've seen a disturbing pattern with PLTR's financials and that's that every year, it's R&D cost is rising by between 150 and 350 million dollars. This is quite a bit of negative revenue and if new contracts are not constantly coming in, PLTR's balance can start going into the negative.

***WHAT WILL NOT DESTROY PALANTIR***

Some people may have concerns over the new left leaning government dumping PLTR. An article was posted that is behind a paywall EVERYWHERE that goes something like this:

[https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker)

In my opinion, i believe this is inconsequential and that a few people crying to daddy Biden to kill a multimillion contract with PLTR is a stretch. Also we know the current new Biden team has his hands full and will have them full for at least the next 1 year with what's going on.

There is no time to deal with a few crybabies and even if he did deal with it and did decide to kill the PLTR Tiberius Covid tracker contract with the CDC which he WONT, these things take months and years to deal with, and by then the contract/s will have already brought PLTR tons of money and revenue in.

***HOW MUCH DOES KARP AND HIS GOONS GET PAID***

Short answer is... A LOT. The amounts below are PER YEAR. That's a lot of money in the hole and contributes to annoying amount to why PLTR is always just at the edge of just barely being profitable.

https://preview.redd.it/ba58nqcurob61.png?width=2615&format=png&auto=webp&s=55d45833faad4d60ea8dc142a9601c44b4cc7395

Palantir's prospectus 311 page document's 130 last pages are almost all exclusively talking about extremely complicated options trading schemes that are made by Cohen and others to make sure they can squeeze out a LOT of money out of PLTR.

Mithril Investments has existed from before and is not a new company. Owned by Thiel/Cohen/Karp as a way to launder and exchange options for more options and more money for all 3 of them. Also Shyam Sankar to me feels corrupt which scares me a bit, he's had some very shady dealings and has brought his wife in PLTR that gets paid 200k per year.

Prospectus Document: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm)

I suggest you skim through it, it contains EVERYTHING about Palantir.

**Palantir is going to need to have to be getting AT LEAST 500 million in NEW contracts per year to REMAIN BARELY profitable. It's doable in my opinion, but just barely and it's why they made the company public to try and get more people's attention and increase the inflow of contracts.**

&#x200B;

***#5 Soros and his 21 million shares***

First of all, i think we can all agree that Soros can suck it.

If you've read a few articles here and there, you'll know that Soros owns/owned 1% of Class A PLTR shares. No one knows whether he's sold them yet or if he's an DPO holder who'll sell 3 days after February's earnings.

Whether he sells them or buys more will be mostly inconsequential in my opinion. We see dips and pumps every day. He legally cannot sell his shares all at once, he'll have to sell certain amounts daily and over time. This will create annoying sideways motion as shares exchange hands and consolidation starts for 2-3 weeks until his and insider shares exchange hands.

Nothing special to see here, move along just a little draw down resulting in some consolidation.

PLTR is exposed to OIL more than anything, so fluctuations in the general market and general market crashes affect PLTR much less than other stocks. Also PLTR does not track ANY benchmarks. NONE.

&#x200B;

***#6 DPO expiry 3 days after earnings in February***

To my limited knowledge, this is how BIG plays who are holding DPO shares usually work:

* If a stock has performed well up to earnings and investors are more than happy with the returns, they're more likely to not sell their stock or just sell less than they normally would.
* If a stock hasn't performed as well as investors thought, these investors are more likely to sell stock or reduce their positions more than normal.

There's a total of 1.16Billion Class A PLTR shares currently (Give or take don't flog me). We are currently trading with \~250 million shares while the rest are locked away in the DPO.

When those shares are ""unlocked"" in February, the price of the stock won't be diluted. These shares already exist and are accounted for. They are simply locked. Also when they are unlocked, the share price won't simply multiply because all shares are now tradeable.

>According to [Palantir‚Äôs after-hours filing with the SEC this afternoon](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520257973/d89036dex991.htm), the company has 1.16 billion Class A shares, 484 million Class B shares and 1 million Class F shares on its cap table outstanding today, or a total of roughly 1.64 billion. Only Class A shares will trade, and Class B and F shares are convertible to Class A shares on a one-to-one basis. On a fully diluted basis, which Palantir says represents 2.2 billion shares total according to its most recent S-1 filing, the company is valued at $16 billion. The difference between those two aggregate numbers comes from outstanding stock performance grants, warrants and other financial instruments.

What **WILL** affect stock price:

* Employees exercising their non class A options into Class A shares. This IS dilution.
* The bigwigs e.g Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a few other bigshots exercising their options and then selling them for a profit.

*To note, regular employees will barely affect the price of the stock with their miniscule share holdings. Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a handful of other high ranked executives in PLTR are the ones that will create a tiny but manageable ripple in the stock price.*

What **COULD** affect the stock price a lot:

* Massive sell off by the big institutional holders.
* Not shorters. (Citron and Citi can suck it, we're in control here)
* People with weak spaghetti wet paper hands.
* Everyone fomoing the same weeklies e.g like when everyone bought Jan 15 calls on everything.
* Big but silent scare campaign (that's already going on) to scare off normies like us.

&#x200B;

***#7 What does PLTR do, tldr.***

Imagine Facebook's database of everything about everyone & Youtube's Database of everything & Geolocation data in a database made by the US Army for known terrorist cells.

Palantir allows you to select and match varied data TYPES from several different database, combine it in any way you want and visualize it so that it's human readable by even the dumbest person in the room so that even they can see patterns and come to conclusion on a subject matter.

It's kind of like filling an excel sheet with data and then visualizing it with a bar chart, except the date you filled the sheet with can be anything and not just numbers or dates or countries and you can make various combinations using all the different rows of data to maybe come up with a pattern to something like how to best distribute the Covid vaccines in the counties in a very specific state in the US.

Literally what you see in SciFi movies where people combine random data by smashing keys on a keyboard and somehow find the murderer, the location of a terrorist or the percentage that someone will commit a murder in the future based on a lot of random data about that person or the area, country, family, history... anything.

While this all might sound super cool and amazing, it is. Maybe in 10 years time there will be a few more companies doing this, but for now, it's only Palantir, Circles, Alteryx and a few other private entities that do this type of thing. Many of them work with governments and are hush hush due to the kinds of things they use this type of software for (terrorist cells, warzones, etc) and the public backlash this could cause.

tldr: Glorified data aggregator and visualization platform/software with different access levels for different people.

**PLTR is superbly positioned to offer their software to SLOW and Boomer like organizations like Governments.**

Governments are stupid and don't have neither the time, nor technical knowledge to develop this software themselves for internal use. This is what PLTR capitalizes on and why Governments use them so much.

Governments could have spent the a fraction of the money they spend on PLTR contracts to make the software themselves but only for their own internal systems and use, but they can't and if they tried, they'd fail because technocracy in governments is not a thing. By the time they'd even complete a project like this, it'd likely be out of spec, unusable and would require further development and money and we know how slow and bad governments are at doing even the basics. Again PLTR wins because of this.

**PLTR is likely NOT** to be adopted by giants like Google or FB or other modern tech organizations of any size because they are not stupid. They have their own purpose built internal systems that they use to do everything related to data aggregation and visualization because they have the technical knowledge and resources. Buying PLTR for their use is a joke.

PLTR capitalizes on being general a general purpose tool and is set up manually by an engineer over the course of 4-10 days for each customer. The engineer customizes and configures the system for each company's custom use since the software allows you to do so. Regular aggregation and visualization software CAN do the same, but typically lacks data input types and features that PLTR has because PLTR has cultivated a special set of features over many years that were suggested by their existing clientele in battlefields and other places.

Now friends, here's my position on PLTR. I'll be holding onto it for the next year. If it's not at least 300% by then, i'm selling it and moving on to the next stock. App i'm using is Revolut.

Also yes, i'm ALL-IN only on Palantir because i know my money will multiply itself in the short term. I'm not holding this till 2025 as others are supposedly doing. I'm selling in 2022 with 300% or more profit. PLTR is severely undervalued, underpriced because it's a DPO. Give it till EOY and we're going to be rich. If it was an IPO it'd be trading at 180+ already imho.

I've spent the last month and a half holding PLTR. I've gone full schizzo mode when it comes to PLTR. I lose sleep daily and i love it. I hadn't slept for 37 hours a few days ago because i spent so much time researching PLTR and scraping the internet for all possible information.

I come from an IT/Development background, so i understand what PLTR does completely.

My PT's for PLTR are:

* 48-89 by March or April.
* 75 - 125 by EOY.
* 200+ 2022 IF they solve their income and constantly increasing R&D cost issues.

A few days later AWS news came, and that $10k turned into $70k. Pure luck. Sometimes she goes, sometimes she doesn‚Äôt. She went that day.

In that moment of seeing massive profits on AWS news day, I experienced violent and absolutely tremendous autism and thought, this thing is going from $5‚Äôs to $15 in a single trading session, yes, even more retarded than you guys that bought the top on Friday 

Sensible thoughts couldn‚Äôt penetrate my helmet fast enough as drool gushed from my gaping mouth, gasping for oxygen and yelling at the top of my lungs what barely resembled words about Lambo‚Äôs and Yachts... so I hurled about $100k into shares at $8.77 and about $10k more into $15 leaps 

I proceeded to watch my profit dwindle to nothing as earnings came and bent me over so hard I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to watch the stock for a week 

I thought about selling the bottom, I was there, order ready typed, just needed to hit the send button, and I was going to close my position around $6.7ish and be back to break even after striking gold 

But you know what, I remembered it‚Äôs just money. I remembered that everything in reality is in flux, and changing, and decaying, and being born again, and to just flow with it and stop clinging and desiring one set of experiences over another (aka a fat bank account over giving $5 blowies behind a Wendy‚Äôs) who cares? 

All is well lads. So let go of the burden if you bought the top and are stressing, it‚Äôs really fine. Look at what‚Äôs happening right now:

1) Insane volume, insane moves, erratic behavior (something is going on behind the curtain) 

PS: this movement and volume is NOT because of WSB, full stop. Big players are making huge moves here, and fast, we don‚Äôt know why yet 

2) 1 Billion annual revenue 

3) Soon to come online a RECURRING AUTO DATA business that will drive revenue into growth cycle, BB is literally Microsoft Windows for cars but the auto sector was still underdeveloped technologically to benefit from this position, hence this vertical is finally about to print HUGE HUGE HUGE MEGA BILLIONS ANNUALLY. This was always the plan and they just had to wait it out until the auto sector caught up with them digitally 

(The auto data tech sector is so lucrative it made Papa Elon the richest person in the world, and forced a fucking god damn phone company to join the race üçé‚Äîit‚Äôs huge)

4) UNDER, FUCKING, VALUED 

5) VERTICALS GALORE

5) FB settled, imagine the BALLS on BB going after this massive and dirty tech behemoth run by a literal lizard, they are honest Canadians doing God‚Äôs work 

6) IOT, AI, smart city‚Äôs, insert other buzzwords 

I could go on and on, and honestly, I‚Äôve never felt more comfortable holding ANY stock than this 

Moral of the story: as I let go and accepted my circumstances and decided to diamond hand üíé ü§ö BB to the death, within a few days I proceeded to watch the fattest, thickest, randomest, greenest dildo penetrate my butt hole to the high heavens and take me from what was $70k profit to 0 profit back up to $130k profit. I‚Äôve trimmed half the options, I don‚Äôt even know why tbh, reverse autism maybe, but I‚Äôm riding my remaining calls and entire share position to Valhalla. 

Will likely add more if it dips. But...

Just hold. Something is cooking on BB. You have to be a retard not to see it. Look at the fucking daily chart, look at the volume, the gaps, the swings, BB chart literally has Tourette‚Äôs syndrome right now... 

This stock has not moved like this for 10 years. 

It might stall a little, deflate from here, consolidate a bit more, or it might blast off again any second. Point is, nobody knows when, but it looks like in a short time, we will know why this stock is moving the way it has. Something is DEFINITELY going on behind the scenes the public is not aware of and neither is the media 

For fucks sake I found the court docs showing global settlement with FB is done 24 hours before gay ass Bloomberg even picked it up. The majority of the investor world still thinks they make fucking phones for Gods sake. Everyone is sleeping on this 

A note on Jim just in case he reads this:

Jim Cramer hates this stock because 1) BB and John Chen are not bootlicking CEO‚Äôs jerking off CNBC and massaging Cramers asshole for air time, they‚Äôre a tightly run, honorable company doing real things 2) He most likely became a bag holder during the epic fall of the BB phone and sold for a fat loss and wants to protect his ego by continuing to ignore the facts on the company

The guy wants you to invest in CRWD with a fucking ridiculous market cap, no verticals, and less revenue than BB. Promoting a literal bubble over a value play. What a bizarre world we live in. Take advantage of it, I hear this phrase all the time and I fucking hate it, but this is literally ‚Äúfree money‚Äù 

Know what you own. There is TRUE value in this company. No hype. Pure value. 

Diamond hand, double down, buy more, and just hold. You are in good hands üôå

Recently Tesla had released **it's own converter which was primary a market controlled by SEDG and ENPH**:

[https://electrek.co/2021/01/14/tesla-tsla-solar-power-inverter-launch/](https://electrek.co/2021/01/14/tesla-tsla-solar-power-inverter-launch/)

In addition analysts have raised Teslas top price goal to be **above $1200**:

[https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/passenger-vehicle/cars/tesla-shares-worth-1250-in-top-scenario-analyst/80296697](https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/passenger-vehicle/cars/tesla-shares-worth-1250-in-top-scenario-analyst/80296697)

These two events mean that **TESLA is about to explode next week**. I suspect that by Friday we are looking at maybe as high as $1300 which will result in a second stock split most likely and we will then see Tesla rise from $300 to just under $500 before the run actually ends. Although don't expect Tesla to reach $1000 again for at least another year after that.

While the gloves are hot, Diamond gloves makes it so you don't feel that you have to drop the burning TESLA cash. Do not trade them for paper gloves, for while you won't feel the heat as much the fire will burn that paper, and then you.

These two boys **made HSR filings + a request for early termination** (that was granted). For those of you who don't know what this means:

HSR filings are required (amongst a couple of other requirements) when someone is making an acquisition of >$94m (this is the rate for the past year in 2020. will likely hike somewhere to \~$100m in 2021). This is what we saw with Mithril when they bought a fuck ton of shares in December ([https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210675](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210675))

**Early termination requests are made to bypass the customary 30-day waiting period when someone makes an HSR filing.** This implies that the individual wants to make a purchase in less than 30 days. Both of the early termination requests were granted. Karpy and Cohen are either buying leading up to demo day/the assumed (HOPEFULLY) price hike we see, or, maybe, right around lockup expy time.

I'd leave another thicc rocket for you fuckers, but mods keep auto-deleting the post because of the image.

kynnxf||On GME and what to expect Tues/Wed (DD)|t3_kynnxf|0.97|1259|1259|top|2021-01-16 20:55:54.000000|Fair_Chart3403|415|Discussion|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kynnxf/on_gme_and_what_to_expect_tueswed_dd/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kynnxf/on_gme_and_what_to_expect_tueswed_dd/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kynnxf/on_gme_and_what_to_expect_tueswed_dd/|"Hi everyone,

I'm going to use this space to say what I would expect Tues/Wed regarding GME (obviously not an expert).

# First some facts:

1) There was an obscene amount of shorts of GME before it went up last week (138%+ of float). There is now still an EVEN MORE obscene amount of shorts of GME (120-170% of float as high-quality estimates).

2) There has been over a month of likely ""naked short selling."" Aka, ILLEGAL market manipulation (Sells of unconfirmed shares that then end up not going through) in an attempt to further drive down price (27 days on NYSE Threshold securities list, since Dec 8th).

3) Fees to borrow GME have gone up significantly (sitting around 30% atm) and required margins have increased at brokers (75% for Fidelity, 100% for Schwab). This means those brokers are less confident in it going down, and that there are less available shares floating around (lower volumes).

4) Friday, there was a huge early shorting of the stock (the rapid 10% drop) that led to Rule 201 being invoked (stock can only be shorted on an uptick until EOD Tuesday). How do I know it was likely shorting? Because the drop stopped as soon as the Rule was invoked.

# From these facts, what are conclusions I have drawn?

1) Investors (firms or otherwise) who have shorted GME are **repeatedly doubling down**. Big players are doing so to directly (and sometimes illegally, see naked short selling above) manipulate the market in a downward direction. **They have been working on this for months, making the stock undervalued by far,  which is why short volume has been so high, and are continuing to manipulate this stock downward in an attempt to make those earlier shorts less of a failure.**

2) They believe the current price increase will not be sustained or, more like IMHO, that they can out-short any increase that is sustained, so they are paying increasing fees on those shorts every day until the price drops enough (and it needs to drop A LOT for their earlier shorts).

# So what do I think will happen Tues/Wed?

**1) On Tuesday, SEC Rule 201 is still in effect. That means that short sellers can only sell shorts on ""upticks"" (aka, they can only short at prices above the current market price). I expect that those short sellers will continue to double down, so we may see a price ceiling come into effect. Every time the price increases, the shorting can happen so they'll short it. I expect volume will be relatively low, and the price will not move very far.**

**2) On Wednesday, SEC Rule 201 is not in effect yet. If price moves significantly upwards on Tues, I would almost definitely expect an early short on Wednesday in an attempt to drive small profit selling and further drop the price. If price moves significantly downward on Tues, I would expect the same early shorting in an attempt to induce panic selling. Finally, if price doesn't move much on Tuesday, its much more of a toss-up on their strategy, but I would (personally) anticipate another attempt to short sell the price down as we saw Friday (deep pockets of shorters, already in very deep on shorts).**

**TL;DR: I think shorters gonna keep shorting (legally and illegally) so everyone should be prepared for that. They think the risks of losing older shorts outweighs the risks of additional shorting/the fees of new/old shorts. They've done this level of consistent, repetitive shorting/market manipulation before and have only paid for it a handful of times.**

Just sharing my opinion of what happens next. I'm not here to convince anyone to do anything.

If price shoots up into the mid 50s  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ , definitely duck for cover Friday.  Margin changes are actually bearish. Consider being on a brokerage that pays to loan your shares to shorts if long, because it's very profitable. Shorts can be squeezed, but so too can longs who use call options, and shorts who use put options.

Important note: The massive melt-up we had this week was a GAMMA SQUEEZE. Options market makers had to buy about 30m shares (or cover short shares, thanks Melvin Capital, then buy) while going on that run from 20 to 40 to hedge their positions. That as you know is more than half the float. My belief is that gamma effects will continue to be a big deal - but less of a big deal than last week because we have less options near the money now.  **Ironically, Melvin Capital made this melt-up far stronger, contributing 5m shares of forced buying in a rapid spike at $24/$25.**

**Details:**

I‚Äôve seen a lot of discussions about GME over the past week that are missing important bull and bear elements in the thesis. This sub is so incredibly bullish  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ  that unsurprisingly, there‚Äôs more missing bear arguments than bull, and bearish information is sometimes perceived as bullish (such as the margin requirement increases, which I feel are net-bearish). But there's also missing bull information, namely that more new gamma ramps exist high than low it appears, and they appear pretty large.

I previously posted about some option dynamics last week, that seem to have played out to an extent. I actually lost money on my puts because the expressed vol was less than I thought, and Friday ended up playing out in a basically neutral way from a bull/bear perspective with a mere 10% drawdown. That post is here. I correct predicted the outcome, but didn‚Äôt predict the magnitude well enough and thus my trade sucked:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxb7dy/analysis\_of\_massive\_potential\_gme\_forced\_selling/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxb7dy/analysis_of_massive_potential_gme_forced_selling/)

In this new post, I‚Äôll cover what I know about current option structure (and will update once updated data for Friday comes out), and the implications (TLDR: Mostly, expect vol around multiples of 5 in stock price), as well as other trading dynamic topics that I think are misunderstood or rarely spoken of.

I‚Äôm not going to talk about my opinion of the value of the stock or the turn-around plan. I‚Äôm actually in what is a modest put position for me at the moment (jan 22 $38 puts x 80), but I fully acknowledge this could go to the moon  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ  next week and I'll feel like a miniature Melvin capital (though shorting at $38 is a lot smarter than at $17) and probably deserve it in that case.

**Current Option Structure:**

I will update this as new data gets in, but you can see big concentrations of options at 30, 35, 39/40 and 45. There isn‚Äôt open interest data for Friday, but volume suggests there are further ramps at 50/55/60, but they are probably smaller than the 39/40 and 30 ramps. Normally, dealers are going to be long calls (from people selling covered calls) and short puts (From people buying protection). On GME I think we all know it‚Äôs short calls and short puts, since people are buying tons of calls from them, and also speculating with puts. As such, dealers are extremely short gamma, and that means that prices accelerate from dealer activity greatly. When the stock sells, the dealers have to dump stock (or short it). When the stock goes up, dealers have to buy.  **I believe that the Wednesday melt-up was as much a short squeeze as a gamma squeeze, as the price moved over a bunch of OTM options, forcing dealers to buy as much as a bit more than 1/2 of the total float of the company to hedge! Further evidence of this is that the stock went parabolic but then stopped being parabolic once past the peak option strike available on Wednesday - $40. Without the dealer lift, the rally slowed a lot.** This is why I think it looks as much like gamma squeeze as short squeeze. It‚Äôs also why gamma positions this week are important, but they are smaller than what was available going from 20 to 40.

These patterns are most sharp at these large concentrations of strike prices, so the stock can jump from 39 to 41 a lot easier than from 36 to 38 as an example. On average, it‚Äôs about $1m of stock bought/sold by dealers per percent change. To put in context, there was a jump Friday where about 250k shares got bought and moved the price 5%. That means that if accurate, dealer activity might have been up to half in that flash.   **We don‚Äôt yet have the Friday data, but there was a lot of Friday volume. This amplification may be greater next week. This week had a gamma event on Wednesday, after which there were a ton of ITM WSB calls and OOM Melvin puts that don‚Äôt have gamma, and thus the price de-volatilized somewhat. But we may now be in a situation with a lot of near the money options, which means we could see very large gamma squeezes up or down again.**

Here‚Äôs the structure, I‚Äôll update once there is Friday OI data available. This chart assumes that calls are positive gamma ‚Äì they will all be negative gamma in this case, so predict accordingly.

[https://imgur.com/a/czrKy6X](https://imgur.com/a/czrKy6X)

Also worth mentioning is the expirations next week. Here‚Äôs the current structure for next week, using Thursday data, which I‚Äôll update once I get Friday data:

[https://imgur.com/a/4wKTspB](https://imgur.com/a/4wKTspB)

This is a lot less bearish than the Friday we just had, but again, I‚Äôll update once I get the data. It‚Äôs still a net sell on Friday as those option positions get cleared out (people sell to realize, and then buy other things in general), but more like under 1/10th of float vs the 1/3 of float we were staring at this Friday. Unless people piled into ITM calls Friday, which I find highly unlikely. As such, the downwards force this coming Friday, if this Friday was -10%, is more like -2 or -3% in a vacuum.  However, the higher the prices go into Friday, the more selling this in turn causes Friday, so in a world where we end at $55 on Thursday, I'd definitely not go into Friday long as this forced selling increases.

My sense out of all of this is:

\- The current gamma structure provides more ramps up than down from $35, but there are strong ramps in either direction. BUT, the volume suggests a lot of new put positions were established. On net ‚Äì volatility up, not bearish or bullish. You could maybe argue very slightly bullish I guess.

\- There is some forced selling this coming Friday, but if that was the driving force yesterday, it would be a -3% or -2% not a -10%.  Slightly bearish. Can change based on price.

\- If the stock moons this week, I would encourage you to approach Friday with care, and a more bearish or defensive mentality, even if fundamentally bullish. Similarly, if we are in the 20s, there are situations where friday eventually becomes forced buying from a ton of short term puts printing, and a bear would not want to be short into Friday.

\- A LOT of capital went into OOM puts and calls this week targeting the week after. If the stock is not volatile, a lot of speculators bleed out on both sides. And those numbers may update my assessments above one way or another.

**Margin Changes**

There was a lot of talk about how various brokerages have increased margin requirements on GME stock. Some set to 100% (Schwab), others set up a bit (TDA from 70% to 75%),  others rumored to be planning but haven‚Äôt (IBKR). The reaction of the sub is that this is bullish. It‚Äôs actually bearish, albeit slightly.

The reason is that most of the shorts, in my opinion, are institutional. Retail will typically short with OOM puts which don‚Äôt cause much actual selling to hedge. Institutions short GME are going to have that in a giant account with a ton of other assets, so changes on margin placed on them, if indeed that happened, wont margin call them except in scenarios where GME goes up 20x in a day or something.

On the other hand, if you are a retail trader where half or all of your positions are GME, this margin change does effect you, especially if you were out on margin, and it makes it harder to buy more shares. I don‚Äôt think many retail traders are directly short the stock.  Anyone want to raise their hand and admit they are 50%+ GME and on margin to do it?

Also, consider the context -retail brokerages just did this on the back of everyone here buying shares long. That to me suggests they are looking at customer accounts, seeing some over-extension, worrying about it, and setting the rule to prevent themselves being burned. Some of you have a net worth of mostly GME in your levered account. If that gets squeezed down and a liquidation is forced those brokerages won‚Äôt be seeing the money.

So, I think the margin changes are a bit bearish, but not hugely so. I would also urge you bulls to not set yourself up to be squeezed, which is my next point.

**Squeezes and Short Interest**

It‚Äôs true that this stock has high short interest. There‚Äôs contradictory evidence as to if the shorts went up this week or went down. IBKR share availability suggests it may have went down, other sources suggest up, and I'll update once we have solid post-Friday data that someone posts. However, just because the short interest is high, doesn‚Äôt mean that it can be squeezed easily from here ‚Äì Wednesday I think was that squeeze. A lot of the old shorts may have covered then, and we may be looking at new shorts. It‚Äôs also possible that these institutional shorts hedged with previously deep oom call options and ironically further helped create the melt up, but didn‚Äôt take losses after a certain point. It is worth noting though that MMs engaging in 30m shares of buying (Some of which was short covering) only doubled the stock - and they are now long stock and will loan it out to short sellers all day.

Additionally, while GME longs here on stock are not squeezable if not on margin, those of you on OOM call options ARE squeezable, and those of you on ITM options are in a sense even more squeezable. OOM call options decay if the stock doesn‚Äôt go up, and then the shares dealers bought to hedge the call they sold you get sold back into the pool. ITM options, when sold, do the same but more powerfully ‚Äì selling a very ITM call option on GME means a dealer immediately goes out and dumps 100 shares of GME on the market. If you in turn buy 100 shares, it‚Äôs netural, or if you buy a bunch of NTM calls, you might even cause a net buy. But, those will tend to cause selling if people take money off the table and as time goes on.

And yes, there are a TON of new put options, and those get squeezed out too.

So there is a dual squeeze potential here ‚Äì shorts vs their losses and borrow fees and decaying option positions which cause dealer buying, and longs using margin and longs in call options fighting time and also watching dealers dump their hedged longs.

One other thing -  contrary to what I sometimes read, Melvin Capital was already squeezed, or rather, their dealer was by proxy.  Wednesday was that squeeze. They bought a bunch of ITM put options which forced dealers to sell a ton of stock to hedge. When the price shot up, dealers bought into that short they made to hedge the Melvin puts, and now the Melvin puts expired worthless. Melvin can not be squeezed further unless they enter a new short position of some type. They lost 55M on that trade, and they manage 20 billion. They may be back in it at this point, shorting this even harder is within their power...

Lastly, it has been brought up that some of the GME short, especially those puts lurking at $2 and $1, are hedges by bond holders against bankruptcy, or are hedges by those who sold CDS to bond holders to hedge their short CDS. Those are going to keep accumulating because bankruptcy is possible (though unlikely) in the few year range, and getting those puts now is basically free. But they won't affect the price since they are so far OOM.

**Uptick Rule**

Because the stock was down a lot Friday the uptick rule was triggered until eod Tuesday. That means shorts can‚Äôt sell at the bid to force down price they can only sell at the ask. In practice this won‚Äôt matter a ton since you can still buy puts to make a dealer do this, and my understanding is they aren‚Äôt subject to that rule anyway. EDIT - dealers do have to obey this but appear to be net long the stock currently so would not be affected. I thus feel this is very slightly bullish.

**Yield Enhancement Program**

A pro tip I have for this sub is ‚Äì if you intend to hold a ton of long stock that is in high demand by short sellers, you should get paid to lend it to short sellers. That‚Äôs how the option dealers make a lot of their money ‚Äì I‚Äôm sure citadel is making a killing holding a ton of GME stock to hedge, and promptly lending it to hedge funds at 30% borrow rate, while having very little risk.

Many brokerages don‚Äôt pay you for lending your shares out, but IBKR does. Right now, if your GME shares are loaned out, you get something like 15% annualized in rebates. WeBull, Fidelity and Schwaab also will do this, but I've not used their programs, and you probably have to ask them to sign up. This doesn‚Äôt work if the shares are in margin, they have be fully paid and settled, but it is a substantial extra if you are a long-term believer in the stock, and on other brokerages, they get paid instead of you.  If any other brokerages have this feature that are non-institutional, please post and I‚Äôll add.

It is worth saying that you reduce the cost to short if you do this. I always allow it on my account though because I like the money more and think I‚Äôll beat the shorts eventually anyway. Some money managers never do it so as to not fuel the shorts. But it does pay.

**A Few Other Thoughts on Shorts**

Institutions do sometimes hedge large short positions. It is possible that some of the calls held on Wednesday that caused the giant explosion up were hedges for short positions held by hedge funds/family offices and others.  The fact we didn't see a lot of selling Friday suggests that at least the near the money ones were mostly NOT held as hedges, otherwise they would've been more monetized. But, it's possible that the short pain is less than thought. We just don't know.

**Conclusion:**

I think the major factor here remains simply the desire of this sub to pile new money in. However, it‚Äôs hard to maintain this volatility level and ever higher prices for more than a few weeks without additional catalysts because options are getting pricey and decay will set in, and the higher the price, the more money is required to buy a share.

\- The margin changes, again, are definitely bearish. How bearish? That depends on how many of you guys bought a ton of GME shares on margin and whether or not we gap down Tuesday. I don't think it affects the short interest much.

\- The option situation is probably net bullish Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday, but net bearish Friday (slightly)‚Ä¶ but does mean that next week can be insanely volatile

\- Price moves are easier in the vicinity of $35, $30, $39, $40, and to a lesser extent, $45, $50, $55, $60 due to gamma 'ramps'.

\- I‚Äôll post new data when I get it. It could change the picture to be more clearly bearish or bullish, not just volatile. I'll try to lay out estimates of how many shares MM hold, and then updated gamma ramps, as well as expected MM position holdings at various price levels at the end of the week.

**Update 1-19 AM -** My tool hasn't received nasdaq data yet, but eyeballing the chart it's more or less as before. Large gamma ramp at 40 (huge option positions at 39/40). You saw this at open when you guys bid the stock, and MMs had to buy about 5m-6m shares to not be underwater, providing perhaps 2/3 of the initial buys. We then aw a loss of momentum in the gamma dead zone of the 40s. As I said, lifting into the mid to high 40s is a heavy. Bulls, you should not really pay a lot of attention to gyrations from 37-42, up or down, that's just dealers rolling over options. You had a strong start in any case, but that price zone is going to be extremely volatile this week."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001720.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['GME', 'GAMMA', 'UEEZE', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'OTM', 'I', 'ITM', 'WSB', 'OOM', 'OI', 'I', 'I', 'ITM', 'I', 'BUT', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'LOT', 'OOM', 'GME', 'TDA', 'OOM', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'IBKR', 'I', 'A', 'GME', 'OOM', 'ARE', 'ITM', 'OOM', 'ITM', 'ITM', 'GME', 'GME', 'NTM', 'TON', 'I', 'ITM', 'M', 'GME', 'CDS', 'CDS', 'OOM', 'EDIT', 'I', 'A', 'I', 'GME', 'IBKR', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'NOT', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'MM', 'MM', 'AM', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'OI', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'IBKR', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'IBKR', 'GME', 'GME']

Today I went into Gamestop with the intent of browsing around and using a $25 gift card I got for Christmas like a year ago. I have not been inside a physical GME store since at least 2018 when I bought an Xbox. I immediately noticed that they have a much wider variety of merchandise, everything from games to PC hardware to toys and clothing. So on that note I was looking to buy a new PC gaming headset since I noticed they ""have"" a ton of them. I grabbed one and went to check out. The manager informed me that they don't actually have them in stock or available to order- in fact, most of the items in the store were just display boxes for promotional purposes. I thought this was weird, but she explained that:

**1- They sell in-store items so fast that if they didn't display empty boxes the store would look entirely empty. She gave an example of 200 packs of pokemon cards that sold out completely within 24 hours**

**2- They are reluctant to fill the store with generic items that don't move fast, because that store specifically, among ""3-4 others in the state"" are going to be totally redesigned to accommodate for what she described to me as ""PC building stations"".**  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

**3- They have been absolutely crushing it with sales and store interest due to COVID. She stated that people are buying things that she has never sold before, like niche Wii remotes and other items.""**

Now, we have speculated for some time that GME is going to pivot to PC parts and hardware. I noticed that they do stock some PC peripherals and a few components like graphics cards (older models, they had an NVIDIA 1660 in stock) and PSUs. 

HOWEVER, I haven't seen or heard anything regarding a full-on build station. The way she described it to me, is that customers will be able to totally spec out a PC gaming rig, and have it shipped directly to their house. She said there will likely be a dedicated store employee there to assist customers and provide advice. THIS IS FUCKING HUGE. Currently, you have to be pretty ""in-the-know"" to spec out a gaming PC properly, and the pricing makes it unrealistic for a lot of gamers. On top of that, I think there is a perception that you need a lot more technical skill to get into PC gaming. What GME is doing will allow the PC gaming market to bust wide open and become more accessible for a lot more people. And finally, some sort of agreement or deal with the big manufacturers (as hinted) would make this even more lucrative!

She also said that there is a huge push from upper management for store employees to get knowledgeable on PC gaming and hardware- she said management is pushing hard for the company to step into the future. Meanwhile during the 30 minutes I was in the store, probably 10-15 customers came through and bought at least minor items. Keep in mind this is in a strip mall in a Midwestern rust belt town- certainly does not fit the ""Next blockbuster!1!!!"" thesis.

Personally I believe this is a very bullish move from Gamestop- and bodes well for the future on top of the other well-established information out there. GME is and continues to be an excellent value play, not even accounting for the upcoming short squeeze. It sounds like the vision from Cohen and others at the top is already filtering down to the people charged with carrying it out. I plan to buy at least 50 more shares on Tuesday.

ETA420: DON'T GIVE ME GOLD, KEEP THAT MONEY AND FUCKING BUY GME SHARES

ETA from one of the commenters below, u/theodros1:

""Oh shiiitt. This is amazing. I called a bunch of my local gamestops and luckily got a very talkative sales guy. He says that Gamestop Stores will be either 1.0 or 1.5 stores. The 1.5 stores will be more ""PC oriented"" and will allow users to choose parts. He didn't confirm ""PC building stations"" but dropped an amazing tidbit. The changes started in OCTOBER.... what else happened in October? Ryan fucking Cohen. This is amazing news and hopefully we hear more about it soon in media/press release.

edit: oh shit... I called this other Gamestop and he said the ""Cohen news hasn't materialized yet""... I said him being ""CEO"" and he grunted, I think affirmatively

edit 2: called another gamestop. Overheard them talking about ""reset"" of stores when I asked which store in area was 1.5

edit 3: Found a 1.5 station, he confirmed OP's post. There will be gamestop stores where we can build out our whole PC in store. Didn't have balls to ask about Cohen as CEO though lol"""|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001736.csv|StockTicker|['$GME', 'PC']|['GME']|['PC', 'BUY', 'GME', 'HARES', 'CKETS', 'BOUND', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'PC', 'I', 'PC', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'PC', 'COVID', 'GME', 'PC', 'I', 'PC', 'VIDIA', 'WEVER', 'I', 'PC', 'THIS', 'IS', 'CKING', 'HUGE', 'PC', 'I', 'PC', 'GME', 'PC', 'PC', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'LFG', 'T', 'GIVE', 'ME', 'GOLD', 'KEEP', 'THAT', 'MONEY', 'AND', 'CKING', 'BUY', 'GME', 'HARES', 'ETA', 'I', 'PC', 'PC', 'TOBER', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'PC', 'CEO']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GOLD', 'GME']

kyu3vx||The next 'BB' ticker: BBY (Best Buy) DD|t3_kyu3vx|0.58|20|20|controversial|2021-01-17 02:29:48.000000|Ouiju|47|DD|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyu3vx/the_next_bb_ticker_bby_best_buy_dd/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyu3vx/the_next_bb_ticker_bby_best_buy_dd/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyu3vx/the_next_bb_ticker_bby_best_buy_dd/|"**TLDR**: **BBY** Rocket Ship Emoji, Calls (2/26 120-130cs or a strike near their all time high of 123) and Shares

This is so similar to the other BB ticker DDs I did that most of it going to sound familiar. If you already bought BBY on accident this thinking it was BB or BBBY and need some reassurance, you're in the right place. First, going over my retarded investing tenets to make sure my dumb plays align with it: 

Overall:

1. I'm a retard and don't know anything.

Bull Market specific tenets (if you're a gay bear move on):

1. The market is undervalued, and 

2. Small businesses are getting crushed by governments to the benefit of big business, due to COVID.

What's that mean? Stocks may be overvalued, but the entire market is UNDERvalued, so your own internal stock valuations don't mean shit. Ask yourself, ""where the fuck else would I put my money?"" If you put it in a bank, printer goes BRRRR and you lose value. The only option is real assets: equities and real estate.

So this play, another boomer ass retail chain, sounds dumb as hell when I say it. That means it MUST be good. It's a big business, which our government is bending over backwards to give free money to. Big stores have cash on hand, which smaller businesses it competes with don't. It has an online presence. Online presence sounds ""duh"", except COVID is forcing the move to online quicker than even a skilled executive could pivot. And COVID/WFH means they get to drop their unprofitable stores, employee benefits, and dead weight faster without any blow back from consumers.

All of this is even BEFORE I look at [BBY specifically](http://investors.bestbuy.com/investor-relations/financial-info/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=14535249). Let's get into it:

Upside:

* BBY has cash on hand, $5.1B to be exact (which doubled since COVID began, from $2.2B to $5.1B. See? What did I say?)

* They grew online sales by 174%, AND store sales by 23%. They're being forcefully pivoted online, which is exactly what they NEEDED to do, so even if their leadership was dumb COVID has helped them. Additionally, every boomer is heading to Best Buy to set up their WFH setups with a blank check from their jobs that they can expense.

* They surprised with an EPS of $2.04 last quarter vs $1.70 expected. Margins are only getting better as they can reduce benefits, track every minute of an employee's logged in time, and shut down stores / fire people without any public backlash due to COVID.

* Remember how we all jacked off about GME console sales? BBY is BIGGER and sells more. Basically guaranteed revenue bump from this quarter that wasn't there last year, which will impress wall street because they're retarded like us and like when numbers go up. [The website has crashed over and over due to video game demand](https://www.pennlive.com/business/2020/12/ps5-xbox-series-xs-soon-to-be-restocked-online-at-best-buy.html). That sounds bad, but it's like with PTON being unable to fulfill orders... so many people want it that they're crashing the site.

* They're still below their ATH of 123 from just 2 months ago and they've only been performing the same or better since then.

* Most importantly in my mind, they are still undervalued because they didn't provide good guidance last quarter. Last quarter they beat every metric but the stock dropped from ATH of 123 to ~113 because [they said Q4 sales likely wouldn't be as high due to their high Q3](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/23/best-buy-bby-q3-2021-earnings.html). Well guess what, the market is already pricing in a slow Q4 for every business. There's uncertainty in this stock because of that, yet think of it: how could they have messed up extra console sales and stree-free closure of unprofitable stores? I mean, they could, which I'll go over below.

Downsides:

* Usually my largest gripe is with the people. In this case, [CEO Corie Barry](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2020/01/21/best-buy-ceo-corie-barry-is-a-corporate-iconshes-now-accused-of-having-an-inappropriate-affair-with-a-co-worker/?sh=47abb92f5ce4) is a traditional ""okay"" CEO with a few scandals under her. If she were a really skilled CEO, Best Buy could've been one of the best internet retailers ALREADY. But I'm still going with BBY since COVID is basically forcing them online faster than she would've pushed them.

So let's recap so far:

* An actual profitable business and growing online presence, with all the benfits of having cash on hand.

* Uncertain guidance leading to wall street hesitance

* Tailwinds (gov and economic) pushing them to greater profitability (not even including new console season).

I love this play and it's one of my sleepers. People should realize BBY is similar to GME, TGT, WMT, etc and will outperform it's ""brick and mortar"" expectations online.

Retarded play: Just buy shares if you're scared

It took a lot of research and typing to prepare this for you. But personally I'm a GME believer and it WILL fly üöÄ. 

So you bought GME shares because strangers online told you to and you begin to ask yourself if you are retarded. The answer is yes, yes you are. But there is a good chance you are a lucky retard. If you are FOMO guy you have to decide which scenario is more likely and enter if you believe in happy endings. 
  
There is a lot of noise regarding GME and there is barely any good DD anymore. This is why I decided to put this together. You have to keep in mind that I am a retard myself and not an OG GME gang. I entered GME in January at $19, paper handed in worst possible moment at $32 because I thought squeeze has sqoze. I am now back in the game and reinvested my profit and more back into GME. Only reason why I feel competent to do this is because a) I read a lot about GME and shovel through all the noise to find meaningful info b) apparently no one else is willing to do it properly.  
    
So here it goes from the worst case to the best. All possible scenarios I can think of. If I miss anything or I messed something up, please let me know and I will update this list. This is not a financial advice. You have to make up your own mind and if you can actually read, do your own research.   
  
##**""WE ARE FUCKED!"" scenarios:**  
  
***Ryan Cohen played us all (EDIT: it appears this scenario is impossible. Leaving this up as another proof that I am indeed retarded.)***  
In this scenario RC sells or already sold his shares. We have been duped and it all has been pump and dump. We are all royally fucked.  

For this scenario:   
  
* RC, despite what you can read around here, is not your actual daddy. He is a business man looking to make profit.  
  
Against this scenario:  

* RC is fucking rich and if he wanted, he could already retire. 
* It would ruin his credibility.  
  
How do we know it is happening:  
  
* We learn through official paperwork that RC sold his shares, price reaches near 0 within minutes. 
  
My personal opinion: 
   
* Near zero chance this happens. But if its does, Price Target (PT) is very low.  
   

***GME is practically bankrupt***  
It turns out that RC comes in too late. GME is bankrupt in few months.  

For this scenario:   
  
* That was shorters play from the beginning.  
  
Against this scenario:  

* According to DD posted by people on WSB, GME books look good.  
* New console cycle, stimulus money, post COVID optimism all point that GME should be afloat longer then we need them to.  
  
How do we know it is happening:  
  
* We learn through official paperwork that GME is in a very bad condition. 
  
My personal opinion: 
   
* Very low chance that this happens due to againsts. But if its does, Price Target (PT) is 0.  
   
***Shorters pull a fast one on us***  
In this scenario institutions find a way to squeeze margin positions, outplay options and wait out long positions.  
  
For this scenario:   
  
* They have written the rules of the game and honestly, they know much better how to play it then us. 
  
Against this scenario:  
  
* If they could do it they would probably have already done it instead of loosing almost a billion in options last Friday.  
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Serious price drop on Tuesday despite short restrictions.   
* Price falls in following days below $20 per share and refuses to come back up for a very long time.  

  
My personal opinion:  
  
* Non-zero chance this happens. It is possible. But IMO unlikely because I believe that if they could save their options they would have done it already. PT: uncertain but definitely below $20. $10-$15 if I had to guess.   
   
##**Neutral scenarios:**   
  
***We are in a deadlock aka. ""neutral but actually bad""***  
In this case old shorts are actually covered and we have new shorts on our hands. Price volatility and actual price slowly decrease. Both sides play a waiting game. RC and GME are radio silent for few months.    
 
For this scenario:  
  
* Institutions has already proven that they are committed to their shorts. And they will not admit defeat.
* Shorts have more money and patience.
* If shorts are replaced by new ones, they will not bleed (but that's unlikely).  
* We believe, but a lot of us have paper hands and/or can't afford to keep cash frozen to wait this out.  
* Hype will die down and with it our conviction.  
  
Against this scenario:  

* If the price settles above $30 or even better above $35, shorts will bleed money.  
* If the price remains low ($30 or below), there *may* come other large investors for a long position after they realize that this is a good value investment. This would trigger good scenarios.
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Price volatility decreases over next week or two and settles probably somewhere between $25 and $35. 
  
My personal opinion:  

* Honestly I'm mostly afraid of this scenario. But at the same time it's not very likely that shorts are replaced. Then again, if nothing major happens relativly soon, this is still a likely scenario. PT: $25-$30 for months to come until one side wins.
   
***We are in a deadlock aka. ""neutral but actually good""***  
In this case price volatility slowly decreases, and both sides play a waiting game. RC and GME are radio silent for few months. But in this scenario we overcome our collective retardation and show how strong we are through our unity. Price slowly rises over next months as shorts slowly close their positions.   
 
For this scenario:  

* If the price settles above $30 or even better above $35, shorts will bleed money and will be covering their shorts.  
* One should never underestimate autists.   
  
Against this scenario:  

* United retards with diamond hands? Retail investors are market makers? I want to believe that we have that power but lets keep it real.
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Price volatility decreases over next week or two and settles probably somewhere between $25 and $35. But the trend will become upward after that.
  
My personal opinion:  

* Hard to say. I think some actually good scenarios are more likely then this one.  
   
 
##**Good scenario:**  
  
***Slow and steady short squeeze***  
We win! Shorts are out of ammo, Friday dip was their last hail Mary to stop loses on their puts and are forced to close their position. GME begins it's burn to the moon!
  
For this scenario:  

* Shorts are already kind of fucked.  
* Big investment firms have proven many times before that they are arrogant and they can be very wrong.  
* GME is shorted into oblivion and unless it declares bankruptcy in next weeks or months they will HAVE to exit.  
* Any good news will make this only more likely (like new investor reveals that they are getting involved for a long position).  
  
Against this scenario:  

* Like I said before, we don't exactly know what shorts could have up their sleeve.  
* If shorts are replaced by new ones they will not be forced.   
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Price jumps on Tuesday and continues the trend more slowly later even without short restrictions.  
  
My personal opinion:  

* It's likely and this is my bet. PT: very hard to say but could be anywhere between $60 and $200 or even way more in next weeks or months.   
   
##**Mother of all Short Squeezes**  
   
***We make history***  
It turnes out RC actually is your father. In next few days or weeks he reveals his master plan and shorts are royally fucked. They will sing songs about us.  
   
For this scenario:  

* All of the ""good scenarios"" fors, but the good news is actually something big RC or GME reveals that sends shorts running for their life. 
  
Against this scenario:  

*  RC signed a document that prohibits him from acquiring more then 20% shares and while float is low compared to shorts, it's not enough for MOASS.
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Price opens at $200 or $400 and only goes up. Sorry FOMO guys, the rocket missed the Moon is already past Jupiter.  
   
My personal opinion:  
  
* I and many others dream that RC drops a bomb before Tuesday, but I honestly give this maybe 10% chance of happening. PT: a random number between $420.69 and infinity.   
   
##**Dear FOMO guys**  
If you decide that GME hype is not empty and that the Moon is within reach, please buy non leveraged shares. Margin, leverage or options could fuck you up short term even if in the end we win. 
    
##My position:  
254 long shares at $35.90, 205 leveraged shares at $36.48 (most protected down to $23, considering protecting them even more).

Been seeing lots of cucks writing small DD pieces of bullish or bearish shit. You cucks need to read this cos this is the whole fucking thing.

this is also basically my magnum fucking opus so upvote retards. Dont give me awards, legit go buy a powerup membership for a year. Cant tell you to buy shares because we gonna get closed down by SEC somehow.

im also not some fininacial advisor or whatever just read this and make your own conclusions degenerates. Im not fucking liable lmao but i am balls deep 125 shares @ 19 average now, its literally all I have on this earth.

TLDR: GME DD sumarized, Margin wont affect longs the same way as shorts right now. Dont buy shares on margin though and get ready to supply collateral regardless. Short interest is up and some smart retards are on our side. Read the post to raise your IQ from 8 to 9 though. **üêª üåàs  mega fuk and even posting high level bear shit to scare us.**

Compulsory 7 rockets so you autists dont start having a seizure or something:

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Basically been seeing posts about ""blah blah margin this, short interest this, WS to clever blah"". Going to split this post into distinct sections but im no english degree cuck so dont expect any bear bloomberg  level shit or something

# 1. GME is a fucking steal regardless of squeeze. Buy now or be left on a dying planet while we head to alpha fucking centauri.

So basically everyone here knows about Ryan cohen and his horsemen of the apocalypse coming to steal melvins lunch money. This man bought apple stock in 2017. Hes fucking rich. Hes also an eccommerce wizard, taking CHEWY from a measly 100k co-founded company to a $4 Billion company in 2017 at which point he sold it to petsmart or something. Its now valued at $40 Billion, granted anything eccommerce now gets money thrown at it like a stripper in a high flying strip club or some shit idk im a virgin so dont listen to me, so it may well be a bubble. Regardless the thing grows its revenue like bacteria doing binary fission on agar jelly üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ.

THEY SELL FUCKING PET FOOD. the market for that is like what? $1?. Gaming is going to the moon and is basically recession proof because of how cheap game is compared to other things for how much you get out of it. Any bears saying that Gamestop cant compete with digital or with amazon. Ryan cohen already slapped amazons head in with a no name brand. Hell fucking do it again. About digital everyone here already knows, microsoft deal, Ryan cohen also mentioned the possibility of having ""Digital game exchanging"" or something, image below.

[Online trade ins. It says online.üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ](https://preview.redd.it/2ba9j5d2zvb61.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b6f3f26c3588fdb8cc779aee8a3b1ce42859f33)

He also mentions streaming, digital content etc and aside from all the digital stuff wants GME to move to a community centric structure where big stores operate with VR centres, Internet cafe, table games like Dungeons and dragons and  40k (rapidly growing somehow will boom post covid) and as we now might know due to this post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme\_dd\_buildapc\_kiosks\_coming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/)

BUILD YOUR OWN PC KIOSKS. This is the literal smell of money. Go to your Gamestop to build your PC with your kid? Gamestop is already the goto place wher your parents go to get you your latest digital fix so now they can go build PC's and it cant go tits up?

**Now for some pussy boomer talk (aka fundametals or something).**

The expected Q3 EPS was -0.84$ or something close to that. The actual loss was -0.53$ but boomzoids only talked about the revenue drop. No shit sherlock its closing all its dead weight stores.

In the holiday report I will talk about a bit more below, 11% of stores were closed and revenue dropped only 3%. Comparitive store sales increased nearly 5%. They cant get enough consoles to sell so expect the momentum to carry on for the whole year I expect. Eccommerce is up 300% over holidays. In Q3 they reported 800% to date. In 2020 Gamestops eccomerce went up 24x. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. Online sales now account for \~33% of Gamestops sales now. This is literally gold dust for ryan cohen.

We are still trading at 0.38 P/S at this price. The average P/S for the SP500 is 2.753. Massive upside on these two numbers alone.

Burry got in this for the MOASS and the intrinsic value. At the time intrinsic value was like $22 and this will pump up as RC takes it to new heights.

GME in Q3 somehow halved the expected loss. Big Bad Boomer sherman somehow didnt fuck it up that bad by saying ""omnichannel"" at the speed of light. Yes the revenue dropped 30% but thats covid for you. As the PC kiosk post above shows GME now sells small items basically so fast they have to have fake stock lmao. The new console cycle always spikes the share price sky high too, as youll see in a crayon drawing later. The potential revenue that this console cycle brings in could be huge. Biggest ever is potentially a true statement and Gamestop sells every fucker they get. Combine the fact that they share game pass ( a massive hit) revenue from the xboxes they sell, something no other retailer has, revenue could be sky high.

Now I know you autists are starting to develop short term dyslexia or something but keep reading. This could be the most important piece of shit you read in your life. How do you think I feel? My brains overheating just trying to write coherent sentences.

Holdiay report was a bear trap imo, saw people saying the decrease in revenue was bearish blah blah blah. Lies. Comparitve store sales rose 5% and thats with some towns having like 4 gamestops. When the leases dont get renewed and these stores get liquidated (Also in Ryan cohens letter) they can just get this influx of cash and pay down debt and invest in logistics and marketing and new growth. Gamestop realistically needs like 1/2 the stores they have now and just need to improve efficiency.

[https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890) this article the messiah himself wrote. In it he states:

>At Chewy, we had maniacal discipline when it came to how we spent money. The company-wide culture of frugality came from his example. Free cash flow was our unwavering governor of growth. We grew Chewy from $200 million in sales in 2013 to $3.5 billion in 2018 while spending only $130 million in capital, all of which went into opening distribution centers across the country and acquiring new customers.

Maniacal. Thats all I need to say. The guy is going to get to mars before papa musk and he wont even break a sweat. When FCF starts to catch up to WS expectations every analyst who donwgraded them is gonna get ditched and upgrades will start to happen.

So in the heading i said its a steal. That implies some future higher price target right? Well here is my guess for a conservative price target based on the information above and also some more I probably forgot cos im a retard.

[The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares \(another reason shorts are fuk\)](https://preview.redd.it/dehiug393wb61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=f198773c36d5109382eb2beba6fade3c059121df)

>The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares (another reason shorts are fuk)

This alone means if for not inflation adjusted terms we reached 9.8Bn or whatever the crayon chart says we should reach:

9.8/2.48 = \~3.95   3.95 \* $35.5 = \~$140. The share price now to reach old mkt cap is $140 fucking dollars. Thats a 4 bagger from now. It gets better.

from [statista](https://statista.com) :

>Considering the **annual inflation rate in the United States** in recent years, a 2.24 percent **inflation rate** is a very moderate projection.

If we take 2.24% inflation, the this share price target in todays money means we should reach $182 because of $140 \* 1.0224\^12, = $182 in adjusted. Thats more than a 5 bagger. basically we could see $10 GME price from short manipulation and buying more is basically a lottery ticket!

I really dont understand the bear thesis. The only bear thesis ( short term this one) was that margin would affect longs more but I looked at it on ortex and its basically bullshit. Buy shares with cash though dont use margin. Own your piece of GME dont borrow it. Bears just spout ""DigITaL"" or ""BlOCKbuSTER"" so much Ryan tweeted a shit emoji at them. All the bears think theyre clever. What the fuck makes those cucks special? How are they different now than the ones from $2, or $4, or $10.

**Bears are betting against:**

Ryan fucking cohen, buisness legend CHEWY from 100k investment, now 40 billion

Michael burry, Investing legend, predicted the housing crisis and is in GME since april

u/DeepFuckingValue , the new WSB god chad, now basically a whale

Reggie Fils-Aim√©, gaming and buisness legend, former COO of nintendo

Senvest, a mega fund thats actively managed

Norweigan sovereign wealth fund

Fidelity, Vanguard and blackrock own this shit and are never selling they literally dont give a shit

All of WSB has now formed a shield wall against the bears

Microsoft gave GME highly discounted azure deals and free office use for all employees and a revenue sharing agreement. Bears are stupid if they think MSFT didnt vet GME.

&#x200B;

Some valid bear thesis left now (the only ones left) ----> Ryan Cohen dies.

# 2. Now some analysis on the short squeeze and some technical data on puts and calls and ortex data.

Ok everyone on here and their cat, dog, bedbugs and wifes boyfriend  knows about the squeeze. Jimmy chill aka cramer even talking about it. Gamestop is literally the most shorted stock of all time and space. The squeeze makes every autist salivate because its basically free money while cucking big money out of like what 1% of their fund.

Although I know all you cucks hate shares, and hate holding, if the squeeze doesnt happen selling is probably the most retarded thing anyone could do. Its literally buy high sell low and you fucking disgust me. STONK ONLY GOES UP.

This squeeze is so monumental that its been sucking sharks in like fresh blood. Most of the funds where shorting this from 30-15 dollars before this year so they didnt really care. It all changed with 2 people. u/DeepFuckingValue and Dr. Michael Burry. These guys are as OG as it gets with GME. I think u/DeepFuckingValue may have even sniffed this trade out before the legend himself. Since then funds will have churned this through their rules and started jumping on this train. Ive been in since $13 with 125 shares. If I had more money Id be buying but im just some stupid student ok. Im merely a medium for this money made information.

**The stats for this stock now short wise are, from ortex:**

*Concrete* short interest as of 31 December 2020: **71 Million**.

*Estimated* short interest, *January 11th data:* (This isnt predicted, this is from data in flow, has margin of error) : **77 Million**

Short shares on loan 7 days ago: **50 Million**

Short shares on loan *now* (This breaks the bearish margin calls affect longs more thesis): 54.2 Million

% of known float short: **147%** as of 31 December 2020

% of know free float on loaned shorts: **108%** as of January 11th.

Some [guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyocql/updated_potential_holdings_of_gme/) on here took into account extra buying on wednesday, Institutions, Burry, RC's extra 7% and WSB ownership (something so stupendously  retarded no serious firm will do it) that float on short could be in the 100s of %. Total short float now I would say could be **200-400%** if the numbers are correct.  This pisses on all other short squeezes. Some countries ban shorting above 100% cos of how autistic it is.

The recent hike in interactive brokers available shares is probably a mix of sell off on friday (remember  some guys are now buying lambos with GME money. If they held they could buy 10), calls exercising and puts being covered and brokers ditching the shares. Nakedshort even reported 5 million naked GME shorts on friday. This is bullish as fuck because the best the shorts could do on a red market day was **-10%**.

Gamestop is still on the SECs threshold list for 27 days now.

[This shows naked short selling and downwards pressure hasnt capitulated](https://preview.redd.it/xsetax08pwb61.jpg?width=1083&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=172439b81f509ba01ed3e6489671d6f009298e84)

Ok so now if WSB owns an estimated 6-8% of the stock and we all know to move over to cash accounts now to avoid margin calls, we should be minimizing longs getting margin called. Every bear on stockwits is a clueless cuck who spouts ""blockbuster"" and these guys dont even know what margin even is so my bet is the colossal **54 Million** shares short on loan are gonna be affected by the margin calls more. Why? Because every long on margin is in the green, and now a true zealot/extremist/autist for ryan cohen so will supply their account with collateral to avoid margin call. Shorts are in the massive red zone. How do I know you ask?

Ortex data from Jan 4th 2021:

[This is the data from ortex for short interest for Gamestop for Jan 4th](https://preview.redd.it/urqb3c3zbwb61.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=d874cd908bad7fe3e8aa4486b5a294f5c1d5724e)

So this shows for jan 4th the estimated short interest is 66.98 Million shares. From the exchange reported 71 Million on december 31st this makes a lot of sense because the share price fell from \~21 to \~17 so shorts took profits. The shares on loan arent for longs too. This is all purely short data, and 47M  shorted at $17 this shows.

These shorts are in a circle of hell we cant comprehend and makes satan scared.

SHARES ON LOAN HAVE GONE UP.  BUT 87% OF LOANED SHORTS WHERE SHORTING AT SUB $20.

Cost to borrow is also up, estimated short interest is up to a cataclysmic amount.

Longs on margin need to supply collateral, but we are in the massive green zone, shorts are underwater. Margin calls will ravage the shorts and sting the longs. We also have the uptick rule in place until the end of the day, so shorts can only short on the way up.

**Seen a lot of talk about Gamma hedging and delta.**

You realize that the fucking bankers and brokers dont understand gamma hedging right? That shits up their with the black-scholes equation and feynman-kac solution. Forget about it. The retards claiming to understand it are either payed by hedge funds or lose money. The guy who took out outs thinking options exercising and gamma hedging would lead to a collossal sell off on friday lost money on his puts because **no one** except some quants in a goldman sachs server room know this shit. The idea is simple about neutral delta on options that people take out, but the simple system interacts with every other thing in the stock market, and wow who couldve guessed it, like nearly any other element of the stock market predicting something by the day is nigh impossible. That guy talking about Gamma , Delta and margin calls is on weeklies. Hes no more autistic and equally retarded as all of us. Hes a chill guy though so dont berate a fellow brother.

**Now weve established the likelihood of longs getting margin called is far smaller than shorts, on to the options distributions**

These two graphs, show before market close and after. As we can see the massiver 51000 put contracts didnt get rolled over and the chances that those were melvins july puts rolled up is very high. They expired worthless. Lots of calls are printing big time while huge amounts of puts are worthless and bleeding money.

Something else we can extrapolate from the charts is that massive options trades are not present on the scale we saw before (tens of thousands).

We are seeing a discrepancy in the number of puts/calls opening up at the higher prices with calls gaining fast. This could show that some funds are now becoming optimistic on the long or short term prospects of gamestop. There are also more puts than options and if we assume this for shorts vs longs on margin (without even taking into account that all shorts are borrowed shares and pay interest further bleeding cash) then shorts are likely on more margin than longs.

Regardless fellow autists my main point is two show that the bears are underwater and the bulls are flying high with regards to options.

**Now lets compare this possible squeeze with others.**

Bear in mind this is the most shorted stock of all time, but differences in free float change the share price differently.

Kodak went from **$2.16 to $33.2**

Volkswagen went from **\~200 euro to nearly 1000.**

Overstock went from **\~$21 to $123**

Blue apron went from **$2.31 to $18**

Ive been seeing some estimated that 1 million shares is roughly a dollars move in share price. This maths is about to be pretty autistic so bear with me degnerates.

$1 now is 2.81% of the share price. Everything in the markets is exponential and based on percentages. So if we assume a full squeeze of ortexs estimated short interest (This assumes no sell off and no new shorts, new shorts can be positive or negative depedning on when in the squeeze they happen) **$35.5 \* 1.0281\^77 = $299.** GME to moon. üåë .

This shit can happen. Hold on.

**GME has squeezed and been manipulated before and it always happens around the console cycles. Shorts never win and they wont win now.**

&#x200B;

[This post right here I found months ago and got me in the squeeze from the honourable and valiant u\/Uberkikz aka Rod Alzman](https://preview.redd.it/4ysv7bzclwb61.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=27ac6ac58b6366f81b53fa75966733b8a8d61d3c)

Basically the crayon chart shows green (outstanding shares) orange ( short shares) purple (Market cap) and cyan (Share price). In 2006-2008 the share price rose in tandem with short interest ( Like now ) Until console releases when you can see an abrupt squeeze happend mooning the share price.

This happend to a degree in 2013 with the xbox one but worse conditions for the company and a worse console launch lead to slow short covering but the share price still mooned.

Now we get to the best part. History is repeating itself for the third time and the shares sold short are literally higher than the outstanding shares, which have been decreasing since 2010. Short shares are also at the highest point ever and GME hasnt had a brighter future, well ever. Ps5 and Xbox Series X. are the two most hyped consoles since the Ps2. This is setting up the foundations for massive price movements weve never seen before. This shit has literally never happend, ever. Uncharted waters and we are the captain.

**For the insurmountably retarded autists who think that the squeeze has happend look upon this and despair:**

IHOR IS A MEGA WIZARD

Ihor I quote:

>**A long-buying tsunami ... is the primary factor for the price move**

Ihor Dusaniwsky is managing director of predictive analytics at S3 a firm similar to ortex. He told bloomberg that the squeeze hasnt happend yet and that this was long buying. If someone knows this shit its him. He was talking about the tesla squeeze in january 2020. He has access to resources we can only imagine. Barrons cut his comment that the squeeze hasnt happend yet out it was that fucking bullish. All the media ramming down ""Short squeeze has happend"" down peoples throats because bears are fucking scared.

The bots on stocktwits spamming bearish sentiment should show how rattled they are.

Edit: **You fucking degens just enlightened me that cramer pump is real, funds are ruminating over the long weekend, and stmmy bills pumps stonks and that stimmy bill buys many an xbox. See you at andromeda! Also more rockets.**

BB is looking good for a couple reasons.

1. Rumor of settled lawsuits with FB in BB's favor. Should have details within two weeks.
2. BB just sold phone patents to Huwawei. This frees them from their smartphone burdens and gives more capital for their EBIT.

Trades should not be made on the information presented below. You should do your own DD. Everything below is a matter of opinion and is subject to change, and should be verified. This is also my first DD, so I apologize in advance for mistakes that may be present below. If you do see anything, please call it out in the comments.

Twitter ($TWTR) appears to be on sale, with good signs of upside. Twitter's share price has fallen substantially in light of allegations of censorship and removing Trump from their platform. Other firms in big tech have also experienced similar scrutiny by taking similar steps in light of recent events (i.e. FB and the Zucc). This has left shares on sale, with some appearingly positive buy signals on $TWTR.

Bull Case: Recent price trends and technicals may give an indication for price projections in the near future. While WSB might not like TA, I think it can be useful for making price projections, especially when used in conjunction with evidence from times it has worked previously.

&#x200B;

[red = low where we are; blue = two other interesting lows](https://preview.redd.it/nojbl40jbyb61.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=e35f91ec51393a44e36e1a02981f35a80efd8ff0)

The stock has a strong up trend-line (support, blue) that is touched 3-4 times over the duration of the pandemic rally (March-Present). The two blue arrows signify two important times this support has been touched previously and reversal ensues. At these two points, it also touches or partially penetrates the ichimoku cloud, which can act as an additional support level. Both are also marked by a distinct local minimum in RSI (of roughly 40) in the purple pane. After both of these lows, a substantial retracement occurs, often reaching the value of the previous high rapidly.

Note: values below are estimated

The pattern in these two lows suggests that once the price hits the support, it rapidly retraces to the previous high and then price increases in excess of the previous high. In this first, this is represented by a high of roughly 35 in June, falling to a low of 28 in July where it touches the trendline, and then rockets back to 35 within 2-3 weeks and then exceeding that value in the next weeks (gain of approximately 20% with a buy at 28 and sell target at 35). Similarly, in the second area this is represented by a high of roughly 52 at the end of October, falling to the indicated low of 40 at the start of November (indicated by the second blue arrow), which then rises to 52 in roughly 6 weeks (mid December), and then continues to increase beyond that. This represents a gain in excess of 25% from the low around 40 with a sell target at 52.

At present (red arrow), the stock is poised with the lowest RSI that's been seen in the pandemic rally, falling below 30. This suggests that the stock is oversold, and it is likely to experience a reversal in the near future. Moreover, the price is sitting just at the ichimoku cloud and near the trendline, two supports that were observed in the previous two examples. There is also additional resistance caused by a double bottom, as a result of another candle that shares a low with the current low price. This evidence suggests that TWTR will likely see a big move going upwards in the near future. Buying in now (45.18) and setting a price target around the previous high (55.87) could be return a profit of roughly 23% based on previous patterns. The time horizon for this gain is relatively short, with expectations of around 2-6 weeks based on the two previous trend-line touches (blue). With the oversold RSI condition, it may even be able to reach or exceed the target in a much faster time than previously.

Disclosure of Concerns: Currently the price has fallen below the up trendline (albeit not by much). If the price does fall further, this could indicate the trendline has been violated and the share price will collapse. I think due to the oversold RSI, this is unlikely and that the price is more likely to reverse back into the trading range. Moreover, while the ichimoku cloud does tend to act as a resistance, the price being inside the cloud often suggests greater risk of the stock moving sideways (note how after the second blue arrow, price increases much more slowly when it is trapped inside the cloud). Confirmation of a movement upwards or downwards should be sought before making any trades on twitter stock in light of these concerns. The climate around Twitter isn't positive at present, and this could prolong the amount of time before the the move completes, or even drive down the share price if the situation does not improve. Even after the Trump presidency has ended, twitter is likely to face additional controversy over decisions it may make with the incoming administration. One example is the suggestion that Twitter might reset follower counts to 0 for official White House accounts once the new administration enters. This could put twitter under greater scrutiny once the new administration takes office, with accusations of unfairness already in the air.

TLDR; $TWTR appears to have positive upside. Projections may suggest a gain of over 20% over a span of about 2-6 weeks based on previous price patters. However, there are multiple concerns present in the current climate surrounding the stock and some concerns regarding the current technical position.

Positions in $TWTR: None. I made this DD for fun. If you are interested in purchasing $TWTR shares or calls, I highly encourage doing your own DD before you buy in. This is not financial advice.

**Disclaimer**

This is not investment advice and only serves to provides commentary on of the financial markets and a mosaic theory on what is to come with respect to GME.  Should likely be flagged as NSFW as for many this will be a masturbatory aid for many until the markets open.

**Pre-amble**

I had an epiphany last night and the world just starting make sense. Instead of being overcome by a wave of relief and calmness, I was crushed by a feeling of dread and experienced one of my restless nights of my life. Respite only came by drowning out my thoughts with a bottle of bourbon. 

This first post outlines why GME will experience a short squeeze in the very short term. Dread is the pending dead of this community - undue blame will come from the media with WSB and retail traders in general to take the immediate brunt of the assault. With the additional media attention will come calls for regulation of financial derivatives and further assaults on the ‚Äògamification‚Äô of investing. This post is just to set the foundation of the actual record on what is going to come.  

Those that are active in this community or have been lurking for the past couple years can attest to the increasing media attention that WSB has been receiving. This growth is now exponential with Jim Cramer basically leading a WSB public relations campaign and providing near daily commentary to his audience. There has been a material shift in dynamics in this subreddit over the past year. Many new faces of which quite frankly are financially illiterate. Please do your own research and understand how financial markets and derivates work ‚Äì I have made this as friendly as possible but if you can‚Äôt grasp it get your wife‚Äôs boyfriend to simplify it for you.  

Many of you will not with in the financial markets and not yet grasp the scope of the WSB community as a whole, which is collectively its own hedge fund. The userbase is the working class looking to break out and live some kind of semblance of normal life, chasing the American dream, which is only getting further and further out of reach. We are little guys and accordingly rely on free brokerages like Robinhood, which results in our collective trade execution being complete garbage. Buying into a position results in thousands of users spamming the ask price on Robinhood and driving up market price. If we were a proper hedge fund, the aggregate positions would be acquired through algorithms co-located with the exchanges and other than potential volume spikes would only be actionable through review of regulatory filings.  

We also maintain like the largest research group in the country with thousands of users undergoing financial research and compiling DD on potential new plays. This research is compiled, disseminated, and reviewed, and actioned in real-time which is why attention is picking up. 

We are fundamentally disadvantaged hedge fund and to the dismay of the existing financial community we are actually winning. 

Cramer ‚Äì giving the shifting demographics, I highly suggest you incorporate more rocket emoji‚Äôs into Mad Money or let us sponsor our own segment.   

**GME Short Squeeze**

**1. Why can insider purchases/sales move the market** 

Company insiders generally posses more knowledge of a company and when they buy it‚Äôs a signal the share price is undervalued and when the sell its overvalued. Capital is a scarce resource and directors of companies are human (or some kind of reptile, robot, human hybrids) and they need money to service their lifestyles. 

In WSB terms, if you are yolo‚Äôing funds for a down payment on your house (or to buy a much nicer house with a lambo in the driveway) do you realize your gains when you hit your goal? This can be a prudent financial decision to satisfy a basic human need (shelter and Lambo‚Äôs) and isn‚Äôt always a signal that you think the real estate market and Lambo‚Äôs are better long-term investments than the stock market. 

Insider trades are a potential signal only.  

**2. What happened last week.** 

From 08Jan2021 close to 14Jan2021 close GME increased 126% from $17.69 to $39.91 (ignoring intraday highs) with the gains partially retreating on 15Jan2021 to $35.50 resulting in a 1-week gain of 101%.    

As per media, the pre-market 11Jan2021 SEC filing with Cohen assuming 3-board seats (Cohen and his 2 Chewy pals Alan Attal and Jim Grube) spurred and increase in retail demand and set off a short squeeze with the Friday declines due to the sale of 810,000 indirectly controlled shares by director James Wolf. 

Media is partially correct in that the Ryan Cohen filing resulting in a material increase in retail investment and drove up the share price, however it wasn‚Äôt a short squeeze. The combination of the increased demand and the precariously low float set off a gamma squeeze, which further exacerbating the upwards price movement. 

The James Wolf divestiture for any other company should have been relatively neutral news and should not have resulted in the Friday declines ‚Äì these shares were indirectly owned shares by Hestia Capital Partners, LP with the sale to adhere to the maximum concentration guidelines for single stock investment of Hestia Capital. James Wolf and his wife personally own 50,689 shares (unchanged). James Wolf is on the board due to a proxy battle that goes back to 2019 and it is well covered on pages 13-15 of the 2020 Proxy Statement and is worth a quick read ([https://news.gamestop.com/node/17701/html#toc878410\_6](https://news.gamestop.com/node/17701/html#toc878410_6)). 

As a result, the Friday market reaction is very peculiar. If you manage a portfolio‚Äôs for others and the maximum single stock exposure that can be held is 10% for example with that stock increasing in value more than other positions, you need to reduce the exposure and rebalance to be within the investor policy statement thresholds otherwise it‚Äôs a breach of fiduciary duty. Majority of the disposal was on 12Jan2021 at share price of $19.99 with the remaining 11% (90,000 shares) sold on 13Jan2021 were at $31.08. The requirement to rebalance came before the price spike this week and James‚Äôs clients missed out on 50% one day gains.

Additional insider sales were noted on 15Jan2020 post market by the outgoing directors (not nominated for the 2021 Director Slate) as follows: Lizabeth Dunn (5,000 shares or 8.03% of holdings at $31.34), Raul Fernandez (34,619 shares or 51.36% of holdings at $35.27 average), Kathy Vrabeck (50,000 shares or 38.60% of holdings at $27.99). This represents an additional 89,619 in shares sold by outgoing directors and would be relatively normal given. This should cause an additional market decline on Tuesday absent any other information, however as above these trades should be relatively neutral signals and likely would have occurred with or without a price run up during the week.  

What is currently missing is additional filings for additional share acquisitions of Ryan Cohen, Alan Attal, and Jim Grube that will be forthcoming in the coming weeks and would displace the \~900,000 shares divested above. 

**3. What is a Gamma Squeeze**

This is going to be an oversimplification, as to understand a Gamma squeeze you need to understand the math behind option‚Äôs and the role of Market Makers (‚ÄúMM‚Äù). I am going to keep things simple and only focus on the key points as this has already played out.   

**Delta**: measures the impact of change of the underlying asset. Hopefully you retards understand what a share is and if the share price goes up $1 the price of the share will also go up $1 and shares have a delta of 1. The delta on options will constantly change as the price changes (this is measured by Gamma below), however what is important is that far out of the money options have a delta closer to 0 and deep in the money options have a delta closer to 1 (or -1 if they are puts). Hypothetical example: a call option that as a current delta of 0.7 will go up $0.70 in price for a $1 increase in the share price, as the share price increased the delta will also increase to say 0.71 and then 0.72 and so on. 

**Gamma**: measures the rate of change of Delta. This measures how much the delta will increase with every increase in the share price and will be the highest when the options are at the money. 

**Market Makers**: the MM‚Äôs trade for their own account and make money based on bid-ask spreads (stock and options) and will look to be delta neutral. MM‚Äôs create most of the liquidity in the stock market.  

With that out of the way, what happened with the gamma squeeze?  Well, this is thanks to our friends at Melvin Capital Management LP (‚ÄúMelvin‚Äù) who is well know and documented to death on this boards. As a special thanks to Melvin we should chip in with $100 when they set up their Go Fund Me account next week as none of this would be possible without their assistance. Cole‚Äôs notes are below.  

Melvin‚Äôs most recent filing dated 16Nov2020 disclosed a position of 54,000 put options and has been documented that the open interest was on 15Jan2021 24p.  ([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F\_X01/infotable.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml))  

The Put options would have allowed Melvin to sell 5,400,000 shares (7.83% of total GME shares) at $24 to a 

MM. The MM would have hedged the delta on this position by selling shares short. As the puts went from ITM to ATM to OTM, the market make would have continued to manage a delta neutral position through buying the stock (covering shorts), buying back puts, or buying calls all which would have created positive price pressure.  

Cohen‚Äôs board appointments set everything in motion, share price started spiking, and to remain delta-neutral the MM‚Äôs exacerbated the upside price movements as above (due to the changes in delta). Positive price movements and FOMO on a short squeeze continued to drive up the price (especially with WSB buying deep OTM options and volatility spiking). This defines the price movements on 13Jan2021 the previous downward pressure of the MM short position was unwound. 

**4. Synthetic shares and Regulation SHO**

When you short a stock you borrow a share, sell it with the intent of buying in back at a later date for a cheaper price. When the Borrowed stock is sold, there is now a synthetic share that has been created and you think of this as a legal IOU.   

Naked shorting is illegal with an exception for the MM‚Äôs, which as noted above, is completed to remain a delta neutral position on the security. For all other players that are shorting, they need to locate and borrow the share before they can short it. When there is a purchase or sale and the underlying share certificate is not delivered it is reported as a failure to deliver. Regulations are in place on short sales and a quick summary is available on [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) 

Threshold Securities are equities that have aggregate fail for 5 days, and they pop up on this fun list ([https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)). GME has been on the Threshold security list since 08Dec2020 or 29 trading days. 

The relevant provisions for GME right now are the below: 

Rule 201 ‚Äì Short Sale Price Test Circuit Breaker (or the alternative uptick rule). This was triggered on Friday due to the 10% price decline and will remain in place for Tuesday. At a high level, if the market crashes or continues to fall, this rule is in place to protect the long positions and allow them to exit before new short positions can be created. 

Rule 204 ‚Äì Close-out Requirement. If a security is on the Threshold securities list for 13 consecutive settlement days, shares must be immediately purchased to close out failures to deliver. This rule is supposed to be in place to protect against naked short selling and market manipulation, however it isn‚Äôt really enforced and OSTK (Overstock.com) is a prime example as they made it all the way to 669-days ([https://investors.overstock.com/news-releases/news-release-details/overstock-reappears-regulation-sho-threshold-list](https://investors.overstock.com/news-releases/news-release-details/overstock-reappears-regulation-sho-threshold-list))   

What is enforced is unfortunately enforced is protection for the short sellers, the institutions and hedge funds that are the 1%, and when Overstock tried to push out a dividend which would spur a short squeeze, they didn‚Äôt like this (lawsuit was dismissed and reopened Jan2021). [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/overstock-founder-tried-to-squeeze-short-sellers-then-sold-out-when-the-sec-cracked-down-2019-09-19](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/overstock-founder-tried-to-squeeze-short-sellers-then-sold-out-when-the-sec-cracked-down-2019-09-19) 

There have been rallies on WSB to engage the media and some people have sent in formal complaints, however there is enough information to infer that markets might not be fair as they seem. As per the pre-amble, the collective community has always been fighting an uphill battle. 

**6. Ryan Cohen‚Äôs Twitter Profile**

For any of you following Ryan Cohen on twitter, his most recent post was today with a meme of Dumb and Dumber ‚Äúso you‚Äôre telling me there‚Äôs a chance‚Äù

He is building a social media presence that previously didn‚Äôt exist and everything appears to be focused on aiding what was building up to be a proxy battle for GME. At this point the dude could tweet a video of himself having sex with a pig and I would buy more GME shares (direct reference to Black Mirror S1E1 ‚Äì The National Anthem)   

The historical tweets have generally referenced more share purchases or material pending discloses (board seats), however the underlying is giving fair warning to the short holders to exit positions. Some of the previously deleted tweets are not back and he likely realized that once posted there was no taking them down. 

**7. Short Interest Position**

Short Interest is the number of shares sold short that have not been covered or closed out. Short Interest is formally published to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) twice a month and daily reports published 2 hours post market close ([http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html)) 

[Above chart courtesy of u\/StarSwitch post‚Äô as I don‚Äôt have an OTEX account. Link to post: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/kx047v\/gme\_options\_update\_melvin\_put\_positions\_and\_volume\/  ](https://preview.redd.it/o6i5x4u0qyb61.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=43321f8ca4cf0c90b0e399c1bbf12f830e4b537b)

What is import on all of this is that the current short interest on the company is 79.52 million shares with only 69.75 million shares issued by GME. The 31Dec2020 short interest position was 67.98 million shares, so in 2021 the short positions have grown by 11.54 million shares and there was no actual covering last week. 

What we know is that if the price continues going up the shorts will at one point be forced to buy 80 million shares. 

**6. Volume Reconciliation and Price Volatility** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1l3xc375qyb61.png?width=2207&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e61fa16d0468900fb7f992198bf002bc6efe26d

The last 10 trading days (all of 2021) is depicted above. From 02Jan2021 to 12Jan2021, the average daily volume was 7.95 million shares with the respective volume from 13Jan2021 to 15Jan2021 being 114.50 million, 93.72 million, and 46.75 million shares. 

So, what the fuck is going on? Face appearance looks like volume has surged, and liquidity has increased (more buyers and sellers). 

So back in my pre-amble, I mentioned a fundamental disadvantage that WSB maintains on trade execution as the big players have trading algorithms on servers co-located with the exchanges. The massive increase in the short positions was used to defend a short squeeze, which by all rights should have been set off on 13Jan2021 absent this unfair advantage.  

The cost of the shorts defending their position was opening an additional 11.54 million short positions the long security holders gobbling up these securities. Why would they do this? Well, it‚Äôs their last stand, the magnitude of potential losses in a short squeeze would result in many of the short holders being liquidated and if they started covering their shares throughout the week the volume would have disappeared and the stock price would have been going up dollars each tick. 

In section 2, I noted that the price action on 15Jan2021 was peculiar as the news was neutral. Well, this is our friends is volatility at play, any news (or a tweet from Ryan Cohen like his Dumb or Dumber tweet today) will result in material swings in the stock price as there isn‚Äôt any float remaining ‚Äì the same shares being traded back and forth hundreds of times a day with additional long positions resulting in the 14Jan2021 and 15Jan2021 volume declines. 

For those like Crayons, I am not a fan of technical analysis; however, the last 3 days looks awfully like a bull flag in the above chart, when you considered the price suppression on 13Jan2021.  

**7. What will come**

As many are aware, many brokerages started increasing the margin rates on GME to 100% - Brokerages are afraid of their exposure and don‚Äôt want to get caught. 

Cohen lit the final fuse with his tweet today and we are going to lift off next week.

The short interest being over 100% is unprecedented and this should by all rights be the most aggressive short squeeze ever witnessed in the financial markets. 

I started writing this post yesterday as I was hoping to be able to reconcile a price target for exit. There are a ton of factors at play, however I truly believe now that some of the original posts about this being an infinity squeeze are correct. The $100 million shelf offering, will not be sufficient, and GME will need to announce an additional offering to provide the necessary liquidity for this to fully unwind.

My personal exit strategy: 10% of holding at $1,000, with an additional 10% to be sold every $1,000 price increment."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001738.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['GME', 'NSFW', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'WSB', 'WSB', 'WSB', 'I', 'WSB', 'DD', 'I', 'GME', 'WSB', 'GME', 'SEC', 'LP', 'I', 'LP', 'GME', 'MM', 'MM', 'ITM', 'ATM', 'OTM', 'FOMO', 'WSB', 'OTM', 'MM', 'IOU', 'GME', 'GME', 'OSTK', 'WSB', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'OTEX', 'GME', 'I', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'DD', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'OSTK', 'GME', 'GME', 'OTEX', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Okay, I first off want to say that I am stoked to see all the new degenerates that have decide to join this channel and dump their life savings into whatever one hot stock we are bursting at the seems with at the time. It's an absolute strength in numbers ""win"" for the sub, and it give me more hope for the momentum we build here. 

HOWEVER, I saw a lot of the new crayon casserole lovers, who've taken a break from watching their morning cartoons out there to dump your money into GME this week. Then coming on here and asking, ""I bought ""X number of shares at ""Y"" price, am I going to get rich now?"" 

As someone that has been doing this now for some ten plus years, this is a complete fucking rookie move! You want control over the situation, then use ""Limit Orders"" and assign the price at the proper support levels. You know who uses ""Limit Orders"" the bull with the 10 inch cock that comes over to fuck your wife every night while you sit in the corner chair and watch. Why you might ask? Because he's in control of the situation. He uses limit orders to buy the stock at a specific price instead of just sending the order to the markets makers to be assigned the highest price on the book for the day. So while you are buying that stock at $38.50, he's buying at a cool even $35.00, allowing him to capture 10% more on the upside. 

Perfect example is with GME, where the entire sub is screaming ""hold the line"" blah blah blah ""SPARTA"". You want to hold the line? Then place those future orders at support levels like 33 or 30. That way if and when the stock drops to these levels you get the price you want and you help the stock from dropping even further. So be fucking smart and be patient about this, this is your money so make it work for you and not against you.  

TLDR: Use limit orders if you really want to help control the underlying stock and make a smart investment. Be patient and wait for the price to come to you and so some fucking reasearch."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001733.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'WEVER', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'X', 'I', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME']

This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything.

kzon9z||Don't buy $BB calls, buy $BB shares - Here's why|t3_kzon9z|0.95|1580|1580|top|2021-01-18 09:05:01.000000|SilbergleitJunior|546|Discussion|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzon9z/dont_buy_bb_calls_buy_bb_shares_heres_why/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzon9z/dont_buy_bb_calls_buy_bb_shares_heres_why/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzon9z/dont_buy_bb_calls_buy_bb_shares_heres_why/|"I'll admit it. All this Blackberry pump got me hyped and I want to get some action too. BB has potential to moon, but I think a lot of you will still manage to lose money, because you are picking wrong strategies.

**The problem**

I know this sub is obsessed with short term OTM calls. However by buying these you are doing no justice to yourself and this community.

Let me explain. Have you ever wondered who sells you these calls? I'll tell you. Big guys and by big guys I'm talking billion dollar financial institutions that we call **market makers**. Market maker does not care which stock, what strike, how many üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ we put here - all they care about is to **make money by selling you calls.**

Market makers are very good at managing risk. Whenever they sell calls, they make sure they have the underlying stock. That way, they essentially sell **covered calls** instead of **naked calls**.

When you look at the option table, you will notice a column called **Open Interest**. It basically tells you have many option contracts are out there in the wild. Think about this as a number of retards holding these in their Robinhood account, hoping to get rich quickly.

Market makers love when there is a big hype around certain stock, especially certain strike and date. They sell these calls to you retards, and all they have to do as the expiration date nears is make sure **the stock stays below the most popular strike**, aka **strike with the most open interest**.

Why would they do that? Because they **make free money** by selling you these worthless gambling short term tickets.

How would they do this? By shorting the stock. Remember they are so big that they can afford to short the stock and suppress the price of the stock **in the short term** just in time for **your short term calls to expire worthless**.

I know some of you geniuses will tell me that market makers can't manipulate the stock in the short term; sure keep telling yourself that while you ride in your 2010 Toyota Corolla.

**You are easy targets**

Over 11,000 of you idiots, bought $12 February calls. Don't believe me? Check it yourself: [https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350903153433128967/photo/1](https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350903153433128967/photo/1)

All market makers have to do now, is make sure BB does not moon past $12 by February 19 and they are set. You lost your stimulus check money and have no means to play again.

March is even worse: [https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350910637451468801/photo/1](https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350910637451468801/photo/1). All of you piling into $15 strikes. Why are you making yourself easy targets? You are disclosing your strike and your date! What if BB moons in April? Can you sustain wasting money on these monthly calls with your minimum wage jobs?

**The solution**

Buy shares. They do not expire. There is no pressure to be right. You want to be on the üöÄ when it starts taking off, instead of being broke on the ground.

With worthless calls, no one will like you - even this sub will make funny of you.

Believe me. I've been here long enough to remember MSFT 03/21/2020 C $200 and PLTR 12/31/2020 C $30.

**TL;DR**  
Buy BB shares, not short term OTM calls."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001733.csv|StockTicker|['$BB', '$BB']|[]|['I', 'BB', 'I', 'I', 'OTM', 'I', 'BB', 'BB', 'MSFT', 'C', 'PLTR', 'C', 'BB', 'OTM']|['MSFT']

After a stratospheric year, Cathie Wood‚Äôs Ark Investment Management is ready to take it a step further: Into gourds.

The New York-based firm is planning to launch the ARK Agricultural Exploration ETF (ticker ARKZ), according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The actively managed exchange-traded fund will primarily track U.S. and global companies engaged in gourd harvesting, and related agricultural commodities. 

After massive inflows over the past year, the once-niche firm now oversees about $41.5 billion in ETF products, compared with less than $3.5 billion in the same period in 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ark recently became a [top](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/cathie-wood-s-ark-joins-top-10-etf-giants-with-tesla-heavy-fund)\-10 ETF issuer, thanks in large part to its $21.6 billion flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) that has [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US) as its biggest holding. While the vast majority of ETFs passively track indexes of stocks, Ark offers five actively managed U.S. ETFs, and Wood runs all of them.

After the close of regular trading, [Deere & Company](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/DE:US) soared -0.14%, while gourd futures skyrocketed on additional news that r/wallstreetbets user u/TheEmperorOfJenks was to be appointed Managing Director of the new fund."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001733.csv|StockTicker|['ETF']|[]|['ISHED', 'MON', 'JAN', 'PM', 'ARK', 'ETF', 'U', 'S', 'ETF', 'ETF', 'ETF', 'U', 'S']|['MON']

Smart move my fellow degens üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ strap in, cause you're in for a ride to the moons of fucking pluto.

TL;DR Blackberry/AWS IVY will be in every single vehicle produced after 2022. EV or ICE, self-driving or boomer driving, it doesn't fucking matter. It üöÄ will üöÄ be üöÄ in üöÄ every üöÄ single üöÄ one üöÄ Oh, and Blackberry QNX Neutrinos RTOS is fun too.

Before you start reading, I'd suggest grabbing a snack and a drink. Cause I'm about to drop a fucking novel.

You've probably heard Blackberry QNX a few times around other DDs but you're wondering wtf is it and who the hell is even using it. QNX is an Real Time Operating System (more on this later) meant for vehicles, and it's been around for a really long time. Currently there are at least 175m cars running around with QNX. As for what cars those are, I'll keep it short: Apple Car Play was developed on QNX.

So why haven't we heard more about Blackberry in recent years since there's so many QNX cars around? 2 reasons. 1: Dumbasses like you thought it was a phone company. 2: QNX is so ahead of the fucking game that boomer auto manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes were too stupid to use it effectively. For the last few years it's just been used to turn on your car's radio. *But things have changed now.*

**Zombie cars and QNX**

QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. *What the fuck does that even mean nerd?* For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.

Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.

Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot *program* but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?

What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both [Canoo](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/blackberry-to-power-autonomy-systems-in-canoos-next-generation-electric-vehicles) and [Hyundai](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/hyundai-autron-selects-blackberry-qnx-to-power-next-generation-adas-and-autonomous-driving-software-platform) makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. *But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.*

You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moonüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Linux is also an open source OS and this becomes a huge problem when we talk about zombie cars.

That's right. *Motherfucking zombie cars*. You know that scene in ""Fate of the Furious"" where Charlize Theron straight up just hacks all the cars in the city and starts slamming them into buildings? Yea, this is a legitimate fear of the U.S. government and Linux is not going to pass any safety regulations. And you better believe after SolarWind and FireEye hacks, Cybersecurity is the hottest topic right now when it comes to national security. You better believe the U.S. Government won't just allow open source OS flowing around millions of autonomous driving cars that can be hijacked at any time of day.

You know who does have MULTIPLE government certifications already though? Blackberry bb. I won't get it, but you can read [u/josh\_moworld](https://www.reddit.com/u/josh_moworld/)'s post right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/) to get a better idea Blackberry's history with the U.S. government and security.

The best part about it all is, Blackberry designed QNX to be 100% POSIX compliant. In dumbass terms it basically means any LINUX based program can be ported over easily. Come join the dark side, Elon.

Now that you're pretty much caught up to speed on QNX, let's move over to IVY and why I believe IVY will be Blackberry's return to the throne üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

**Blackberry x AWS IVY**

IVY is a co-development between Blackberry and Amazon and it is a 50/50 partnership. That's right; Jeff Bezos, the second richest man in the world and king of predatory business practices chose to partner with a company that has a $5.5b market cap. All hail, John Chen üëëüëëüëë

So what is IVY? Basically IVY cloud-based software that OEMs can install into their QNX vehicles (or any OS) and read sensor data from the vehicle's DCUs (domain controller units). These are basically sensors that give you data such as: times that you unlocked and locked your car, your car's wheel speed sensors, wiper arm sensors, tire pressure etc. In a Tesla, which is loaded with sensors, you will also see: sentry mode data, when an small object hits your car while parked, how hard you step on the accelerator, how hard you brake etc.

IVY basically captures this data and in real time sends it to OEMs for them to analyze. Cars are going to be fitted with more and more sensors (regardless of if they have autonomous systems or not) and the data that IVY provides is very helpful. This allows OEMs to see their customer's car preferences or driving styles and can further develop their future vehicles to match customer's interests. Also, since the data is transferred in REAL TIME, things like horrible weather conditions, traffic updates, and icy roads can be communicated to all vehicles within the OEM network so that people can be notified ahead of time.

But you know which industry would *love* this? Insurance companies. OEMs can gather all the safety data that IVY delivers and actually PROVE to insurance companies that their cars are safer. You know how Tesla had to come up with their own auto insurance? That was because Insurance companies were charging crazy high rates for Tesla's that had auto pilot. They didn't know exactly how to rate the risk, or who would take the blame. With Blackberry IVY, OEMs and insurance companies can partner together and have reliable data to work off of.

Best part of it all, IVY is extremely scalable and is a subscription based service. There isn't an exact price announced yet, but you know if Jeff Bezos is involved then there will definitely be a lot of profits flowing in from IVY.

For me, I'm long-term on $BB with some options to take advantage of the recent hype. I plan on holding shares until I see an actual competitor to QNX and IVY... which I've looked all over the internet and I can't find any. And honestly, Blackberry's security suite has so much to offer this isn't even the complete DD. I've just been typing for too long and figured it was a good time to stop. Maybe I will write another post in the future."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001723.csv|StockTicker|['DD']|['DD']|['$BB', 'DR', 'AWS', 'IVY', 'EV', 'ICE', 'QNX', 'RTOS', 'QNX', 'QNX', 'QNX', 'QNX', 'QNX', 'QNX', 'QNX', 'RTOS', 'A', 'OS', 'OS', 'EV', 'OS', 'OS', 'SONY', 'QNX', 'QNX', 'XPENG', 'XPEV', 'QNX', 'DESAY', 'NIO', 'NIO', 'DRIVE', 'QNX', 'RTOS', 'I', 'US', 'QNX', '$BB', 'OS', 'U', 'S', 'U', 'S', 'OS', 'TIPLE', 'I', 'U', 'S', 'QNX', 'POSIX', 'LINUX', 'QNX', 'IVY', 'I', 'IVY', 'AWS', 'IVY', 'IVY', 'IVY', 'QNX', 'IVY', 'IVY', 'REAL', 'TIME', 'OEM', 'IVY', 'PROVE', 'IVY', 'IVY', 'IVY', '$BB', 'I', 'I', 'QNX', 'IVY', 'I', 'DD', 'I']|['EV', 'ICE', 'EV', 'NIO', 'NIO', 'DD']

He had 2k twitter followers just a week ago. Who do you think he's tweeting to with emojis and gifs? Us. 

He can't come out and bluntly discuss all of this. The SEC would be on his ass. His lawyers have already made him delete a tweet that was just a picture about a roller coaster.

Imagine that shit. And now he tweets a ü•ú and retard at us. He is excited and literally can't contain it.

But that ain't what I'm here to talk about today.

The squeeze is going to happen. It is in GameStop's best interest for this squeeze to happen.

Y'all keep asking what is the optimal price target to exit. **No one fucking knows**. 

This is gonna go past $100. After that, I have no idea where it goes and no one else does either.

Remember [this shelf offering](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312520312805/d67321d424b5.htm) we learned about at the last earnings call?

The immediate reaction was bearish. The stock dipped. Our retardation was in question. Paper hands jumped ship because management was clearly too stupid to realize a squeeze was on the horizon.

Turns out, management ain't as stupid as you think they are.

**The optimal play for GameStop is to let us squeeze to the moon and then deploy the shelf offering at the top.**

It'll maximize tendies for all parties involved.

What does this mean for us?

The squeeze is coming because **EVERYONE BUT MELVIN** wants it to happen.

Imagine the news coverage GME would get from a historic short squeeze as it moves forward into a new Cohen World Order. GME wants this and prepared for this with their shelf offering.

**My advice:** I don't know if it will be possible, but keep track of all GME news and if news comes out that the shelf offering is being deployed, then I recommend selling. As that may signal the top.

**TL;DR:** Ryan Cohen and GME leadership know about the squeeze. This will trigger. They will deploy their shelf offering at the top. If you hear about it, sell to maximize tendies.

**Positions:** 3300 shares at $16. Loads of 35c 4/16 options.

This is an extension of my [DD last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) in which I shared some research on short positions, GME‚Äôs debt, and some speculation on institutional investing. Since that post, GME is up 75% and there‚Äôs been lots of good [bullish](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyuu13/gme_margin_changes_and_their_implications/) / [bearish](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyoixl/gme_option_margin_and_other_factors_for_trading/) DD on the short term.

In this post, I‚Äôm going to cover 3 topics, focusing on the mid-to-long term prospects for GME: 1) Cohen, 2) GME‚Äôs market cap potential, and 3) potential investors that could continue to pile in.

**TL:DR;** You need to think about GME differently. Not as a trader. Not as an investor. You need to think like a venture capitalist. This is an **unprecedented** opportunity, and the first time I‚Äôve gone all-in - *I‚Äôm more bullish now than when the stock was trading sub $15.* If you‚Äôre in GME you need to get in ***with conviction*** otherwise you‚Äôre going to lose by selling when it drops.

# Quick aside - my history and positions:

I‚Äôve been a passive investor for many years. This is literally the first time I‚Äôve taken an interest in becoming an active investor. I opened an RH account in August to start speculating on GME. My [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/isn2g0/cheap_gme_calls_for_a_potential_lottery_win/) called out some cheap lottery plays that took my speculating account from $5K - $20K in 3 weeks. I‚Äôve since posted a few times on GME, [even trying to tell you to buy the post-earnings dip](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9c95d/gme_earnings_thread/gf4g5vn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and added more to my active trading accounts. I‚Äôve taken $10K -> $130K on RH and $230K -> $480K in IBKR since slowly adding to GME since September.

**UPDATE**: I have deleted my positions in this post - will explain why in my next post. I'm still holding. 

All that being said, thus far I‚Äôve been thinking about GME as a *trade* \- trying to get in at the lowest cost I could for the maximum upside on a near-term exit, but **I‚Äôve switched completely** into thinking of GME is a **ridiculously asymmetric investment** with massive potential in the next 2-3 year timeframe - even at $35. Even at $45, $50, $60. That‚Äôs why I added roughly 2500 shares on Friday at around $36 despite adding very cautiously when GME was below $20. I‚Äôm also completely all-in on RH with options (mostly deep ITM, a few fds) - $0 buying power left.

Grab a drink, sit down. Let me tell you why I‚Äôve gotten more aggressive, and probably why you shouldn‚Äôt worry about what price you pay right now, as long as you‚Äôre willing to **believe and hold.**

# About Cohen (and friends)

From the [recent 8K about the board changes](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18396/html) (which you should **definitely read** if you‚Äôre putting serious money in):

*As part of the Agreement, RC Ventures has agreed to* ***customary standstill provisions***\*, which provide that from the date of the Agreement until the earlier of (a) the date that is 30 calendar days prior to the deadline for the submission of director nominations by stockholders for the Company‚Äôs\* ***2022*** *annual meeting of stockholders and (b) the date that is 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the 2021 Annual Meeting (such period, the ‚ÄúStandstill Period‚Äù), RC Ventures will* ***not, among other things: (i) acquire beneficial ownership in, or aggregate economic exposure to, directly or indirectly, more than 19.9%*** *of the Company‚Äôs outstanding common stock; (ii) make any proposal for consideration by stockholders at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company; (iii) make any offer or proposal with respect to any extraordinary transactions; or (iv) seek, alone or in concert with others, the appointment, election or removal of any directors in opposition to any recommendation of the Board, in each case as further described in the Agreement. As part of the Agreement, the Company has permitted RC Ventures to acquire, whether in a single transaction or multiple transactions from time to time, additional shares of the Company‚Äôs common stock to the extent such acquisitions would result in RC Ventures having beneficial ownership of less than 20.0% of the outstanding shares, without triggering the restrictions that would otherwise be imposed under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the ‚ÄúDGCL‚Äù), and RC Ventures has agreed that upon acquiring beneficial ownership 20.0% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company‚Äôs common stock, the restrictions under Section 203 of the DGCL would apply to a potential business combination with RC Ventures as an ‚Äúinterested stockholder‚Äù (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL).*

This is critical: **This agreement was the result of a negotiation** between Cohen and the existing board.

1. After his [activist letter calling out the board](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf) and then [13D](https://fintel.io/doc/sec/1822844/000119380520001571/e620151_sc13da-gamestop.htm) buy after the earnings dip rocketed the stock up from 12 -> 20, it was clear to everyone that RC was the reason GME‚Äôs stock was heading up. The GME board was afraid of a hostile takeover / losing their jobs. This agreement allowed Cohen and 2 others on the board as long as he didn‚Äôt attempt a hostile takeover.
2. Cohen wants it all. In the activist letter, he publicly said ‚Äúno‚Äù to just one board seat. He then publicly bought more as soon as Sherman threatened a shelf offering to dilute him below 10%.

In addition to getting added to the board, Cohen brought along [2 execs who built Chewy with him](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/11/2156168/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Additional-Board-Refreshment-to-Accelerate-Transformation.html):

* Alan Attal - the previous **COO and CMO of Chewy** (2011 - 2018)
* Jim Grube - the previous **CFO of Chewy** (2015 - 2018)

He‚Äôs not fucking around folks. He wants to build another Chewy, and he‚Äôs bringing the people who helped him do it the first time to do it again.

As a result of the agreement, he‚Äôs limited to buying up to 20% of shares until 2022. **Why not 13%? Simple - Cohen wants the option to buy more.** He‚Äôs not happy with a single board seat; he‚Äôs not going to settle for simply getting added to the board; and **he‚Äôs not going to settle for 13% ownership.**

Also, remember that **Alan and Jim have üí≤ to buy in** as well. I haven't seen their holdings yet. Their time is worth more than their money and they've already decided to put their time in.

## Cohen is not an exec - he‚Äôs a founder with an all-in mentality

Go read this [bloomberg Cohen interview](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo) to understand his mindset.

1. Cohen himself is an all-in person. Key quote:
   1. *‚ÄúWhen I find things I have a lot of* ***conviction*** *in, I go* ***all-in***\*.‚Äù\*
   2. Cohen is a founder that has gone through the successful creation of a startup. **When you are startup founder, most of your NW is tied to equity in your company.** You are trained to have skin in the game. You‚Äôre not allowed to think you have a safety net. You give up years of your life and bet everything because you have to believe in what you‚Äôre doing. **Founders typically have 30-50% ownership of their company.**
   3. *‚ÄúCohen uses the word ‚Äúconviction‚Äù a lot. He says it‚Äôs something he learned from his father, who ran a glassware importing business in Montreal where Cohen grew up. ‚ÄúHe taught me how to block the noise from the masses,‚Äù says Cohen. ‚ÄúTo have a point of view and have conviction and not waver.‚Äù*
2. He only sold Chewy rather taking it to IPO because of his Dad‚Äôs health. He cut his entrepreneurial career short and he‚Äôs itching to get back in.
3. Cohen sold Chewy for $3.35B, with estimates stating he personally walked away with about $600M after taxes.
4. Cohen has a lot of capital to buy more. After selling Chewy, he went all-in on Apple & WFC, which as of June was **up 40%**.
   1. *‚Äú Cohen says his portfolio, when including dividends and a few other stock holdings, has returned more than 40% over the past 3 years, beating the market.‚Äù*
   2. Aapl **was his largest holding, and** **is up another 50% since June 5** when the Bloomberg article was published.
   3. Cohen lives in FL - with no income or capital gains for individuals, unlike other founders who live in CA which taxes all cap gains as ordinary income.
   4. I‚Äôm going to estimate *his net worth (minus his GME holdings) is around $800M-$1B.*
5. Cohen‚Äôs 9,001,000 (it‚Äôs over 9000! üê≤üèê) shares have thus far been purchased at something like an average of $12/share, for a total investment of around $110M.

So Cohen has put in $110M out of his $1B into GME. **Does that sound like he‚Äôs all-in?** Absolutely fucking not. Cohen‚Äôs **going to buy up to the max he can this year** (20%), likely by selling some other holdings prior to [cap gains tax law changes](https://www.wealthmanagement.com/high-net-worth/guide-potential-tax-law-changes-under-biden). He can **add more next year** after the standstill period is done.

## What will lead to Cohen‚Äôs next purchase of GME

Thus far, every RC purchase has been *about sending a message*.

1. Prior to Q3 earnings, his purchases were signaling an intent to the board that he was serious about wanting to get involved. He also rubbed it in their faces that the stock price was largely appreciating because of him. From the [activist letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf):
   1. ‚ÄúWe recognize that the Board may feel it is insulated from stockholder scrutiny after adding new directors this past spring and seeing a recent stock price uptick **(which only came on the heels of RC Ventures filing its 13D)‚Äù**  (what a *fucking burn*).
2. If there was any doubt about RC‚Äôs impact on the stock price, it was put to rest after Q3‚Äôs earnings, where the current leadership‚Äôs hubris and threat of diluting RC led to a drop of almost 30%. RC then bought the dip, shoved it in their faces, and the market GME again rocketing GME to 20 in a massive post-earnings recovery. Message sent again - ‚ÄúThe market wants me. Let me the fuck in.‚Äù
3. Now that Cohen and the Chewy folks are on the board, he‚Äôs going to angle for CEO. He‚Äôs not looking to **advise** GME. He wants to go all-in, to run GME. *He‚Äôs holding the optionality of buying more based on the success of his attempt to take over GME through non-hostile means.*

**If you see Cohen buy more GME, he‚Äôs sending another message.** This time it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs clear to him he‚Äôs going to be CEO and wants to max his skin in the game. **If you see Cohen buy, it‚Äôs ‚ÄúCEO talks going well‚Äù - you fucking buy.**

# GME‚Äôs market cap potential

1. Cohen sees a [$200BN+ total addressable market cap for gaming by 2023](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf). For contrast, Chewy was playing in the pet food/supplies market, which has a total addressable market (TAM) of [under $50BN annually](https://www.americanpetproducts.org/press_industrytrends.asp). **GME‚Äôs potential is at base 4x that of Chewy.** This **does not even account for the pc gaming hardware market**, which is another $[35BN](https://www.statista.com/statistics/269244/graphics-hardware-market-value-in-the-gaming-segment-since-2009/#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,by%20the%20end%20of%202020.)\+.
2. Chewy‚Äôs market cap is [$44BN](https://www.google.com/search?q=chewy+market+cap&oq=chewy+market+cap&aqs=chrome..69i57j0j0i22i30l3.6432j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) on [$6BN](https://s23.q4cdn.com/610444331/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/3Q-2020-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL.pdf) of annual revenue.
3. Chewy‚Äôs Q3 quarterly income was up 45% YoY. While GME‚Äôs quarterly income was down YoY, [its e-commerce revenue was **up 257%** trouncing Chewy‚Äôs growth rate](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-third-quarter-results-positive-start-fourth).
4. GME‚Äôs Q4 early sales preview reported [**300% E-commerce growth and annual run-rate of $5BN**](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results)

In other words, *even if you give GME‚Äôs physical locations no value*, GME‚Äôs ecommerce business is **growing 5x faster than Chewy** and already has 75% of online revenue.

**Summary:** Chewy is priced > 7X times its annual **total revenue**. GME is priced at .45 **its annual ecommerce revenue,** despite GME having **5-6 greater TAM** and growing its ecommerce business **5X as fast Chewy.**

What. The. Fuck.

I‚Äôve never seen a stock more mispriced.

People talking about $100 price targets are suffering from a *fucking lack of imagination.*

Even if you *completely* discount

1. GME‚Äôs physical business
2. its rev sharing partnership with MSFT
3. its 5x faster growth and 5x TAM

and give GME the same P/S multiple that Chewy has on its ecommerce business, **that puts GME currently at a fair market cap above $35BN.** That means GME should be **at least $500/share.**

In pictures:

**$35/share is a fucking steal.** Who cares about the short-term dips as shorts try to weasel themselves out of their positions. The market will eventually wake up to this sleeping beast. In a year you‚Äôre not going to care if you got in at 4, 12, 20, 35, or 50. You‚Äôre going to only care if you‚Äôre in or not.

# Potential Investors

An asset is only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it, right? So are the potential buyers of this growing company?

Here‚Äôs a list in decreasing order of likelihood.

1. **Elon** (Least likely, completely improbable, but cataclysmic event). Elon hates shorts. Elon, with TSLA, went through the pain that GME is going through. TSLA almost went bankrupt because shorts were pushing the price down so it was difficult to raise the cash they needed to survive. Sound familiar? ***Elon‚Äôs wealth swings more in a day than GME is worth in entirety.*** Elon could **buy all the fucking float of GME with what he makes in 8 hours**. One call from fellow entrepreneur and [aspiring twitter-meme-god](https://twitter.com/ryancohen) would absolutely wreck the game.
   1. **If you are short gamestop**, you are one meme purchase by the richest man in the world away from a fucking cataclysmic event. ""Hey son, I heard you like games. So I bought you gamestop. All of it."" üöÄ
2. **Buffett** (More likely, still improbable). I‚Äôm actually amazed that while Buffett & co were lamenting that there are no interesting stocks to invest in and moving to cash, that they absolutely missed the boat on GME while it was at its lows. It‚Äôs a complete value play right up his alley (in a business he can understand). My only hypothesis here is that the market cap is too small and he could not make a meaningful investment. Once GME grows to a more respectable market cap ($10b+) I can see Buffett stepping in and making an investment.
3. **Cohen‚Äôs connections. (Highly likely if Cohen is CEO).** This is the big one. And I mean absolutely nail in the coffin re-pricing of GME for the foreseeable future. [Go read this Harvard Business Review piece](https://hbr.org/2020/01/the-founder-of-chewy-com-on-finding-the-financing-to-achieve-scale) on Cohen specifically on how Cohen puts importance on raising money and the people that backed him.
   1. Look, I‚Äôve started a startup before in the valley (unsuccessfully unfortunately). However, you don‚Äôt start a company without making a shit-ton of venture capitalist & angel investor connections. Cohen has stated that when pitching Chewy he was rejected by [over 100 investors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=4e3c77f95840). I can absolutely-fucking-guarantee you that every single one of them remembers their mistake and would not miss the opportunity to invest in Cohen again. And don‚Äôt forget all of the investors who DID invest with Cohen and reaped the benefits with Chewy. While venture capitalists don‚Äôt generally make investments in public equities, this is a **truly unique situation. Cohen is treating this like a rebirth, a new venture bootstrapped from GME‚Äôs bones.** If VCs as a firm will not invest, you can bet your ass that those individuals will throw their personal money at Cohen. **However this only happens if he‚Äôs CEO.** As soon as he‚Äôs CEO, a single long weekend trip to the valley might mean 100+ investor meetings with the strategic pitch.
      1. My biggest fear here is that VCs/PE band to take the company private at some small multiple (2-3x) and then reap the benefits while Cohen turns the company around only to re-list it to us 5 years down the road at 30X the valuation.
   2. Thus far, it‚Äôs been us retail retards vs the wall street shorts. HFs shorting this thing have the advantage in both tactics and capital. However, **if Silicon Valley money starts pouring money into this the game is over.** You cannot believe the amount of money that gets thrown into startups with 90% of it burning up into thin air. $3B market cap? That‚Äôs nothing. Folks with Silicon Valley money & risk tolerance would have no problem betting on a serial entrepreneur making something amazing out of a company that already has a customer base, revenue, distribution - all in the same business (e-commerce) the entrepreneur already proved themselves in.
4. **You, and every other retard that believes.** Look, this was my point at the beginning. You need to think like a VC here. VCs are the ultimate YOLO autists making million dollar bets and not seeing a penny of it for years. They are the ultimate üíé‚úãü§ö. **You need to decide if you have conviction** for the long term and then buy in. üíé‚úãü§ö doesn‚Äôt mean selling at $100. It doesn‚Äôt means selling at $200. **It means not selling at all this year no matter the price, and at least until you learn for sure whether Cohen is the new CEO**. It means believing so hard that you 20-100X your investment in 2 years when the market wakes up to the ridiculous mispricing.
   1. Remember that if Cohen is elected CEO he can (and likely will) buy more than a 20% stake in 2022.
   2. Remember Buffett‚Äôs actual quote: [**""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2018/01/30/winning-in-the-market-with-the-patience-of-the-wright-brothers-and-warren-buffett/?sh=26303ec3633b)

**I‚Äôve put every dollar I can** into shares in IBKR, minus some April calls. I hold no covered calls except for some call spreads I had in RH prior to recent bump. I have April calls because I will put more cash into GME after taxes are done, and I know much cash I have to use. Calls let me cap the price I would have to pay now.

This is personal research. **Do your own DD.**

A wiser investor than me gave the advice of ***‚ÄúDon‚Äôt aim to maximise profit, minimize regret.‚Äù*** If you‚Äôre not in GME yet, ask yourself how you would truly feel if what everyone here is saying panned out to be true, and you weren‚Äôt participating.

Oh, and of course: üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

**Update 1:** I'm still holding today, but I realized I made a pretty big mistake on the ecommerce revenue analysis. GME's 2019 e-commerce revenue was 1.35B (not 1.35B for the quarter), so divide my price target by 4 - $125/share or $8B market cap."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001727.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['DD', 'I', 'GME', 'DD', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'RH', 'GME', 'K', 'K', 'GME', 'K', 'K', 'RH', 'K', 'K', 'IBKR', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'RH', 'ITM', 'K', 'RC', 'RC', 'RC', 'RC', 'RC', 'DGCL', 'RC', 'RC', 'GME', 'COO', 'CMO', 'CFO', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'NW', 'IPO', 'B', 'M', 'WFC', 'FL', 'CA', 'GME', 'B', 'M', 'M', 'B', 'GME', 'GME', 'RC', 'RC', 'RC', 'RC', 'GME', 'GME', 'CEO', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'CEO', 'CEO', 'BN', 'FINAL', 'Y', 'Y', 'X', 'GME', 'GME', 'X', 'MSFT', 'TAM', 'GME', 'S', 'GME', 'BN', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'DID', 'CEO', 'CEO', 'PE', 'X', 'B', 'VC', 'YOLO', 'X', 'CEO', 'I', 'IBKR', 'I', 'I', 'RH', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'DD', 'A', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'B', 'B', 'B']|['DD', 'GME', 'DD', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'IBKR', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'COO', 'CMO', 'CFO', 'WFC', 'FL', 'CA', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'Y', 'Y', 'GME', 'GME', 'MSFT', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'PE', 'VC', 'IBKR', 'GME', 'DD', 'GME']

In a few hours, the market opens, and the flood gates will begin. I'm all for GME, both for the MOASS and the long-term outlook of the company. I have been theory crafting all weekend, reading every fucking DD, Discussion, and Shitpost since August 2020 post to this god-forsaken Subreddit and there is one simple fact that is currently not being discussed. I'll start off with a TL,DR and then go from there.

TL,DR: Bears are undeniably fucked, You control the power, GME is not going to the moon, but to the edge of the fucking observable universe.üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Let's go, Gamestop has a NEGATIVE Float. There is likely not an original Gamestop issued share left on the market. What do I mean? Per my last post, I told you that there are approx 69.75 million OG shares, and approx \~75 Million shares owned by insiders (board of directors)/top 10 institutions\[1\]. meaning the likelihood of the shares that you, me, and DeeEffVee own are a shorted share. What I failed to emphasize, is the ABSOLUTE SHEER MAGNITUDE of the situation. There is no way that shorts can get themselves out of it. They're only going to be buying back their shorted shares which, since they are above 100%, there is no way to do that, unless institutions sell off everything they own into the open market. Which is unlikely, as institutions are in it for a long haul, but there may be some trimming on the way up. 

I've commonly simplified this potential squeeze as 100 PS5s(common shares) and 134 PS5 buyers(shorts), but I've had an epiphany that it is wrong. The 100 PS5s are already purchased, sitting in the institution/insider's homes and more than likely, the shares that are out there being traded have been created by the shorts. Where the fuck am I going with this? THERE ARE NO PS5s LEFT AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU AND I ARE PLAYING WITH IS A SHORTED SHARE. THERE IS NO TRUE FLOAT LEFT, AND NOW WE ARE PLAYING AROUND WITH FUCKING IOUs. We still have legal ownership, and voting power with our shares, but they've been created out of the borrowing process of shorting a share, and not a genuine OG share. I reiterate, Gamestop is essentially in a Negative float % position.

Now, what does that mean for the outcome of the situation? bringing up some data that u/TitusSupremus provided on his last post, we can see that of the 79,519,042 shorted shared, 68% or 54,168,330 of all shorted shares are shorted on margin. Some of which are naked shorted shares, which of course, is an illegal activity when not covered within a 3 day timeframe. (we are at trading day #27.) With many brokerages starting to increase their margin requirements, and maintenance %'s. Brokers will force a buy-to-close on short positions on behalf of the shorts. This is going to cause a snowball effect, coupled with the SEC 201 (Up-Tick Rule enacted until EOD Tuesday 01/19/2021).

I have two theories of what may happen tomorrow/this week

1)Margin call happens, we have an increase of buying pressure due to all you loyal GME DiamondHands, along with retail and investment F.O.M.O., ALONG WITH MARGIN CALLED SHORTS WHO CAN'T CLEAR UP ENOUGH CAPITAL TO COVER THEIR POSITIONS, all the buying pressure means that price goes up and our friend SEC 201, more brokers are going to buy-to-close, etc. etc. taking us well beyond $420.69 and into the territory of whatever price you want to sell at. 

2)We remain fairly flat, since shorts can only sell on the up-tick, throughout the day, as brokers are allowing shorts to clear up capital on other investments to cover their margin call. More illegal shorting occurs, and shorts double down on their position even greater. Wednesday and beyond, just spikes and dips like we‚Äôve seen since last week on an upward trend. 

Positions: 1000 shares @ 15.84

TLDR at Bottom

I'll get straight to the point.  MIK is extremely undervalued right now, and is going to moon due to its statistics indicating a stock much below industry average, strong earnings outlook due to circumstances, and VERY HIGH possibility of a short squeeze.

    MIK‚Äôs P/E ratio is much further below industry standard at (during time of writing) 10.93 compared to general retail‚Äôs current P/E ratio of 23.23 (according to NYU).  Including MIK‚Äôs strong earnings outlook, this indicates a very low P/E ratio, forcing the stock higher.  Following the current trends of Retail, and assuming Michaels was at the current general retail P/E ratio, it would not be a stretch to assume that the stock could double by the end of the year, and go up a very sizable amount in the short term.  This follows the trend set by the stock price since march.  This trend is set to continue and the reasons why will be explained in the next paragraph.

    Excluding 2020 Q2 (for hopefully obvious reasons), as the year has gone along MIK has beaten earnings by a good amount.  In 2020 Q3 by 0.38$,  2020 Q4 by 0.27$, and with 2021 Q1 coming with a substantial earnings estimate jump along with it being $1.43 compared to 2020 Q4‚Äôs $0.59 estimate, shows great growth for MIK.  With many new strains of the coronavirus showing up, MIK‚Äôs classification as an essential business, and many people doing/ trying arts and crafts at home, along with school projects also mostly happening during the 2021 Q1 period, this shows a great earnings growth possibility, which will spike the stock, especially compounded with what is mentioned in the next paragraph.

    A retail short squeeze similar to what is happening with GME and BBBY is also likely to happen to MIK very soon.  At Dec 31 2020, MIK had a short percentage of float of 33.25% (extremely high is 20%), along with the average time to short expiry being 3.44 days, a short squeeze is imminent, and along with the high possibility of growth, the imminent short squeeze will only spike the stock higher.  Note that while the short percentage of float is lower than BBBY or GME, the average short expiry time is also much lower, showing that those who are shorting are starting to get forced to cover at higher and higher prices.

TLDR

Good statistics and an imminent short squeeze are sending MIK to the moon! üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Here's another position for ya.

FB is the most undervalued mega tech growth stock on the market today. Period. I've heard the most insane statements with respect to the future of facebook as a company. ""This is the end!"", ""Everyone's deleting their accounts!"", ""The scum of our society!"", ""Trump will teach them!"", etc....

No one gives a fuck about your conservative right wing viewpoints. No one gives a fuck that you deleted your account (you have zero influence on the global population). This company will continue to steal your wife's boyfriend's daughter's soul and print cash to the cows come home.

Are you still not listening? This company has data on 40% of the global population. If there is nothing else to take away from this. Trust that this company will monetize that data over and over and over again. They will figure out how to make you an addict. Like heroin to the vein. Like you getting cucked by Jimbo the plumber.

Social media is officially a VICE. Same shelf as sex, drugs, gambling....I'll put my money behind these categories every day of the week.

Anyways. Take a look at growth. This company's earnings are ripping YoY. PEG ratio under 1. Forward P/E is trading like a boomer stock in today's environment.

SHUTUP and buy facebook before you realize you were a fucking idiot for not buying facebook.

""BUT ANTITRUST!"" Shutup. Buy facebook.

**Position: 55x Jan 2023 $300C.**

UPDATE: Earnings are next Wednesday, if you want a cheaper and riskier play, buy $265-$275 with term that straddles earnings. I would buy into Feb/March. Rockets.

LGI Homes is a home builder that is (i) focused on entry level homes with an ASP of $240k, (ii) in the fastest growing markets including Texas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas and (iii) has the highest gross profit and EBITDA margins relative to its larger peers driven by the aggressive commission style comp structure.

This is one of the smaller public home builders at a \~$2.5bn market cap, and is positioned perfectly for the trends the housing market will see over the near and long-term.

With existing home sales going crazy and prices skyrocketing, new builds / developments are positioned perfectly for those new home buyers, especially with interest rates at zero and stimmy checks going out.

Why the fuck do you think a company like PLTR has a 50B MC? This thing does similar numbers to BB but loses more money and is evaluated at 7-8X the current price of BB. It‚Äôs because it IPO‚Äôd in the middle of the EV/TSLA crazy and had all eyes on it.
 
BlackBerry, however, is a fucking dinosaur! You ask someone on the street that knows nothing about EVs what BlackBerry does and they confidently tell you they make old cell phones. You fuckheads and wetdicks would say the same shit a month ago. That‚Äôs not who they are anymore, they just don‚Äôt have an IPO to get everyone‚Äôs attention which is why you can still get it at such dirt cheap prices.

The past 3 trading sessions were the FIRST 3 trading sessions that this thing has started trading as a speculative play, as it should! It has a new Cybersecurity suite to compete with CRWD, new partnership with AMZN to be a huge player in EV/AV. Huge partnerships with countless OEMs and carmakers, potential to partner with Tesla and it‚Äôs about damn time you autists caught on. Instead of trading like the dinosaur company it‚Äôs been, it‚Äôs starting to trade like the future technologies company it is and will be in the next 3-5 years.

Long time WSB lurker and I've learned a lot here, so I'd like to give back and hopefully add some value to this sub.  I think it‚Äôs worth spending a little time laying out my thoughts on why I‚Äôm investing in GME as an active early stage VC, and hopefully my insights can help people not paperhand before the real gains are made.  I'll try to provide new insights that I haven't seen on this subreddit yet.

Full disclaimer- this is my personal money I‚Äôm investing.  Positions are 678 shares at a $39.81 average as a starter and looking to open a more significant position in the next few months once a few questions have been answered for me on things I‚Äôm looking to see (which I‚Äôll discuss below).

Obligatory rockets: üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ.  If a few things happen, this goes to the moon regardless of a short squeeze.  I'll explain why below.

First, a quick overview at how most VC's do due diligence.

**How VC's Invest**

When we do due diligence on early stage investments (our Fund is a pre-seed and seed Fund with a few Series A deals), there‚Äôs a few things we look for, especially when evaluating growth companies in tech are as follows:

1) What‚Äôs the market size? There are three types of market sizes investors look at; TAM, SAM and SOM.   Feel free to look up how sizing these markets works if you aren't familiar, this is a long post so I won't waste people's time.  The important thing to remember here is that **the larger the TAM, the more room for growth and competition and the more interest there is to invest in a space.**  This is very important for GME and we will come back to why later.

2) What's the CAGR?  (Compound Annual Growth Rate).  Basically, is the market expanding or shrinking, and how fast.  Again, google this if not familiar.

3) Experience of the management team- have they actually been there before and demonstrated an ability to scale and exit a company in this space?

4) Unit economics- do the numbers make sense as this company grows?  Is it actually going to be profitable?  Every firm looks at these different.  We look at CAC/LTV ratios and doubling time with tech companies.  The TLDR of this is ""how much money does it cost me to get a new customer, how long will they be my customer before they leave, how much money will they spend while they are my customer, and how fast can I double the money I spent on advertising to get that new customer "".

There are a lot more things that obviously go into determining whether something is a good investment or not, but if there are red flags in any of these core areas a tech company is almost always uninvestable.

**Now onto why after recent developments I think GME is shaping up to be one of the most attractive investment opportunities that investors have seen in these markets in years, but why many of you will miss out on the majority of the gains long term.**

1 and 2) Market size and CAGR.  As a gamer myself in spare time and a tech investor this is a market that hasn't even scratched the surface of how large it will get.  Gaming is a market worth hundreds of billions, with an explosive CAGR as more young people grow up with gaming being a socially accepted activity and in many people's lives the center of their social experience.   Most of you are familiar with this already, so nothing more to be said here.  

Now the question in the past was, is Gamestop capable of growing their share of this market?  Until Ryan Cohen, the answer was no (and this is why the share price went down to where it was).  Again, you all know this.  But this leads to the second point of why it is now an attractive option

2) Ryan Cohen.  Not from an ""excited about a memeing CEO"" perspective, but from the most important thing to institutional investors- does he have a proven track record scaling and exiting profitable e-commerce businesses?  Yes he does.  

Again, you all know all this and it is how the stock price got to here today.  Everyone is sitting waiting and watching to see if there is a short squeeze (myself included), and there is a lot of hype and excitement.

**But this is leading everyone to miss the forest for the trees because of the 4th point:**

GME's Unit Economics have the potential to be best in industry, yet shares are priced at an extreme discount to revenues currently.

I'd encourage everyone to check out this article talking about how companies with strong growth are normally priced by tech investors by one of the A16z partner.  [https://a16z.com/2020/08/17/role-of-entry-multiples-in-valuations/](https://a16z.com/2020/08/17/role-of-entry-multiples-in-valuations/)  The article is titled ""why entry multiples don't matter"" and helps entrepreneurs understand how valuations of companies can make sense for tech investors.

The short of it is for all the WSBers who can't read: if you have more growth, you get a higher multiple because you will have the potential to produce far more dividends faster, especially in high margin tech companies.

So what is fascinating about GME?

**If I was presented a new company that had just driven it's e-commerce revenues 300%!!!!! YoY, operating in a several hundred billion TAM, backed by investors and management who had grown a company in the same vertical to hundreds of millions in annual subscription revenue, and with a strong balance sheet and distribution footprint and a widely recognized brand, 20x topline revenue in the early stages would be considered a steal to invest at.** 

Instead, GME is priced at a $2.8B market cap, less than half of annual revenues.

This is an unheard of valuation for a growth company to be trading at a discount.

So why is GME underpriced, and why did so many people (myself included) not see or continue to not see this opportunity until now?  If it's such a good opportunity, why are shares so cheap?

**Most investors are looking at the legacy Gamestop business that has existed for the past decade instead of treating GME like a new startup (CHEWY for Gaming).**

If Ryan Cohen can transform GME into a subscription-based membership model where in exchange for your monthly fee you have a one stop shop to all things gaming discounted, you have a company that could easily be valued at a 10-30x multiple on top-line revenues.  However, because most investors outside of this subreddit still view it as a traditional brick and mortar play vs. a subscription focused tech company with omnichannel growth strategies, they think a bubble is forming and are shorting it instead of buying in.

**So why am I not all in yet but why am I excited?**

The most important thing yet to be understood is what does the customer value proposition look like under the new direction Ryan Cohen takes GME.  Most large investors will be waiting to see how over the next year the balance sheet is strengthened for growth, what new revenue models can be implemented, and to see if there has been a true pivot from brick and mortar.

This is a company that if management can execute on correctly, most large institutional investors will be clamoring to get a significant stake in and grow it because the gaming market is here to stay and grow.  Bear arguments that digital game sales will hurt GME miss the entire point of the pivot.  Ryan understands this and wants to instead bring the whole gaming experience in house- everything you buy you want to buy from GME because you're part of their membership program (again think Costco).  Those programs are insanely profitable and if the unit economics show that to investors as the company pivots the valuation will soar immediately as people realize it's Amazon Prime, not Blockbuster.  However, it is yet to be seen if they can execute on this vision, which is why I am not all in yet.

There is still long term risk which is why this stock is still low.  Not a lot but there is some.

Maybe the company doesn't grow?  Maybe they reject Ryan's vision?

But here's the bottom line.

If a shift to digital first does occur, and GME becomes a subscription first omnichannel gaming company, the market cap will conservatively be 10x topline revenues.

Let's say that stays flat next year at $5B.  

This market cap (matching industry standards) **should for an appropriate valuation for a growth stock be $50B.** 

I know this sounds insane.  But if Ryan can complete the transformation he is hoping for this is a very conservative valuation.

A $50B market cap would be $800 a share right now.  Again, this assumes Zero topline revenue growth.  If revenue begins to grow again 10x will be unrealistic and the multiples will get far higher.

This is why the short squeeze is distracting many.  **In 5 years if you diamond hands this company, the fair value of shares can range from $800-$2400 and not be in any sort of bubble or unjustified by fundamentals speculation.**

TLDR; this company if Ryan does what we believe he will may be one of the most undervalued companies this subreddit has ever discovered.  Even if you take profits in a short squeeze, don't forget to keep shares for a long position because opportunities like this rarely come around.  I imagine the short squeeze will allow them to issue more shares to  strengthen the balance sheet, and the company has a fantastic launch pad to start from with the size of it's existing customer base, brand awareness, and revenue. If it becomes clear that GME will be executing on Ryan's vision even at a $10B market cap this will be a steal and I will open a full position then.  I am waiting to expand my position to see what happens with the pivot, as this all goes out the window if GME rejects his strategy.

As always, do your own DD but I have learned a lot about options from this sub and hopefully this helps a few people understand why selling shares may end up being the biggest regret of their life.  **GME's business model has the potential to look just like Amazon's with a focus on the gaming industry and these shares are only at this price because the market is still looking at the old company and not the new startup that GME could become.**

**Don't paper hand this one.**"|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001723.csv|StockTicker|['A']|[]|['WSB', 'I', 'GME', 'VC', 'I', 'A', 'TAM', 'SAM', 'SOM', 'I', 'TAM', 'GME', 'CAGR', 'LTV', 'TLDR', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'CAGR', 'CAGR', 'GME', 'I', 'Y', 'TAM', 'GME', 'B', 'GME', 'GME', 'CHEWY', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'B', 'B', 'I', 'A', 'B', 'I', 'GME', 'B', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'DD', 'I', 'GME']|['GME', 'VC', 'SAM', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'Y', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'DD', 'GME']

Rule in place was essentially that they can only short when on an uptick

**Why didn't the squeeze happen on 1/19?**‚Äã

Squeeze did not happen today because of a couple of reasons:

1. There were outstanding shares for Citron/Melvin/short sellers to continue to short to push the price down. At this point, we can see that there are barely any shares left for them to short.
2. Paper-handed autists who panicked-sold when they bought in at 43-34 and saw it drop to 38 without understanding it was going to happen due to the shorts.

They [timed their tweet and simultaneously shorted close to 2.2m shares](https://i.imgur.com/MMb3i5n.png) but people were relentless in buying them all up. As we can see, the trackers eventually stopped tracking the shares available to short, as it went from a million down to [8,000 to 7,000 bouncing back up to 100,000](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/773545837212598284/801303927215226901/dq6ajcxm7bc61.png) before it went radio silent.

‚Äã

Yet even with their efforts, people still bought and they barely tanked the stock price at all. It even tested the 42 price limit once again just prior to power hour.


**How did those 100,000 shares get freed up?**

Yes, you got it, paper-hands who are selling their shares & refilling the shorts' ammo.

Also brokers who borrow shares from people's account on opting to pay them interest for the melvins & citrons to short (please explicitly call your broker to say you do not want them lending shares out)

They are done, unless there is a mass exodus of people who sell their shares(we can clearly see that's not the case, any dip is immediately bought up and we go right back to challenging any price limits of 41, 42, 44) ; the interest rates for them to borrow shares to continue to short their positions will eventually kill them. We are already at 57% interest over the weekend, we are so very close.

‚Äã

For the squeeze to occur, many people must understand what is actually going on.

‚Äã

If you do not, then seeing it fall from 43 to 38 in a couple of hours will definitely scare you. But there's a reason why we call it diamond-handing, because none of these actually matters. There will still be dips, there will be always people paper-handing their shares but once it squeezes, it will be glorious. There are people who got in over a year ago and have made millions who will not let go, because they fully grasp the situation.

‚Äã

Don't let your heart rule over the sensible minds who know this inside out for a year or 2 in this one, because if you are afraid the squeeze is not coming and decide to sell your shares, just know that the same way it gets continuously bought up at 38,39 there will be people who still go in.

## **tl;dr:**

## **1. BUY SHARES WITH CASH. TURN OFF SHARE BORROWING.**
## **2. STOP PAPER HANDING GME!! DIAMOND HAND ALL THE WAY. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

It's quite clear that they are all scared. And it's impossible for them to cover without booking loss. Call premiums signal that.

They aren't against WSB. They realized people here won't sell. So what's the other way that can exit this position? They are trying to get more short sellers on board that can **take their positions**. And these new people will disproportionately be retail. These companies are not for public good.

Well here‚Äôs a fairly precise not too technical guide as to who the fuck these roaches are, so that the average retard on r/wsb with IQ in the -ve range can understand. Listen, english isn‚Äôt my first or my second language, i tried my best, suck it up if it ain‚Äôt good enough.

**Citron Research** is a shady as fuck stock commentary website operated by Mr. **Andrew Left**. Now a bit on this autist. In short, Andrew‚Äôs a üåàüêª, in long he‚Äôs a self proclaimed ‚Äú*activist short seller*‚Äù. He was married to Ms. Andrea Left, *her username checked out*. His internet newsletter has been running for 17 years now, and apparently has 50 cases in the company‚Äôs favor since 2001, do the math and you find out that he can fuckin time travel. Now, there‚Äôs a lot of stock commentary websites, newsletters, tv shows and podcasts. Why has Citron Research become such a beacon to attract controversy?  

Why has Citron Research become such a beacon to attract controversy? Well, dear autists, the self proclaimed ‚Äú*activist*‚Äù we‚Äôre talking about here, who sees himself as a messiah against corporate fraud and market manipulation is reported by NYTimes as follows : ‚ÄúHe can make a killing in a bear market while everyone else on Wall Street suffers.‚Äù His methods of investment are rather questionable and has come under much of the financial world‚Äôs scrutiny.

Now, fellow autists, this part is very important. **This is his strategy**. Reported by NYTimes once again ‚ÄúAfter he places a bet against the price of a stock, he then publishes research designed to torpedo the company‚Äôs value, often by airing accusations of fraud or abuse. This is entirely legal, as long as what he publishes is not itself fraudulent. Left takes short positions in companies across a whole range of industries.‚Äù Keep in mind we are talking about a man that shorted Tesla stock in 2018 and got mad when it didn‚Äôt go his way. So mad that he sued Tesla and Papa Elon for stock manipulation. [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/short-seller-andrew-left-files-class-action-lawsuit-against-tesla-and-elon-musk.html). 

SERIOUSLY, THIS DUDE FUCKING SHORTED TESLA AT **$177**, ITS AT **$4,325** TODAY (Pre-Split price). If this wasn‚Äôt enough wait to hear the companies in his ‚Äú*ambitious track record*‚Äù. 

Since all of you lack basic correlation skills to connect the dots, let me do it for you fucking losers. What is he doing with GME. Are we not seeing the same pattern here? He is publicly short on GME and is tweeting it. He is known for this kind of manipulation. When he noticed the price had crossed the $43 wall he made it public that he is short GME. He could‚Äôve scheduled the meeting immediately, but no. He scheduled it a day later, now this is perfect for the üåàüêª because, he is literally buying time. Buying time when alot of GME holders are in with their life savings on r/wsb. **24 HOURS IS ENOUGH TIME TO SOW THE SEEDS OF DOUBT AND CAUSE PARANOIA TO PEOPLE WITH THEIR LIFE ON LINE.

**SCANDAL #1**. Here‚Äôs a notable event on this aucstivist. In 2016, this üåàüêª was banned from the Hong Kong stock market for 5 years over a 2012 report on the firm China Evergrande Group as a result of releasing a report containing ‚Äúfalse and/or misleading claims‚Äù about the above-mentioned company. Forced to pay a little over $720,000 as fines on the profits and legal expenses. He‚Äôs on his last string in HK, after his warning, he could end up in jail for violating once again.

**SCANDAL 2**. This guy is what he swore to destroy at this point wait till you read this. Jumia Technologies ($JMIA : NYSE) is an online e-commerce platform founded out of Nigeria in 2012. They gained a fair amount of traction and went public in Apr 2019. It was received very well and rose from around $25 at opening to $41 within a matter of a few weeks. Everything was well until Shitron Research adopted a short position and saw nothing of its potentials. The report came in accusing Jumia of fraud, torpedo‚Äôing the company downwards. It dropped till approx. $2.80. BUT GUESS WHAT, SURPRISE! SHITRON AND ANDICKREW üåàüêª said they‚Äôre LONG ON THE STOCK. AND THERE‚ÄôS **NO WAY** THEY‚ÄôRE SHORTING AGAIN.

We will be hit badly again, the boomer investors cannot take Citron‚Äôs cock out of their mouths, so we expect a sell off, DO NOT GIVE THE BEARS A CHANCE TO BUY. Today could even be a red day, **BUT FEAR NOT**. We will hopefully emerge victorious. I AM SO PROUD OF EVERY LAST AUTIST ON HERE üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ.

**NOTE** :

Holding our shares doesnt cost us anything ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

The short sellers pay high borrow fees and will eventually get margin called if the price rises further.

A red day doesnt matter at all as we are not selling anyway üíéüíéüôåüèºüôåüèº its just a question of time until the next good news hit and it will explode üî•üöÄ

TL;DR : Citron‚Äôs been doing this for a long time. The stocks they short do go down only because boomer investors suck them off dry. Time for a revolution. HOLD ON TO YOUR STOCKS WITH DIAMOND HANDS üëêüëêüëêüëêüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíé. HOARD AND HOLD. EVEN A RED DAY OR TWO WON‚ÄôT EXTINGUISH THE FLAME IN WSB. LET US FUCKING TAKE OFF AUTISTS üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ.

Edit #1 : Citron really just chickened out of the livestream that was taking place lmfao. THIS IS WORKING EVERYONE HOLD üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001730.csv|StockTicker|['A', '$GME']|['GME']|['IQ', 'OUSLY', 'THIS', 'DUDE', 'CKING', 'ORTED', 'TESLA', 'AT', 'ITS', 'AT', 'TODAY', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'HOURS', 'IS', 'NOUGH', 'TIME', 'TO', 'SOW', 'THE', 'SEEDS', 'OF', 'DOUBT', 'AND', 'CAUSE', 'ANOIA', 'TO', 'EOPLE', 'WITH', 'THEIR', 'LIFE', 'ON', 'LINE', 'BUT', 'WHAT', 'ARE', 'WE', 'GONA', 'DO', 'WE', 'ARE', 'GOING', 'TO', 'CKING', 'HOLD', 'TO', 'ATEST', 'PDATE', 'AM', 'EST', 'THEY', 'NEED', 'MORE', 'TIME', 'THE', 'HORTS', 'ARE', 'ATING', 'THIS', 'IS', 'RKING', 'GUYS', 'HOLD', 'ANDAL', 'HK', 'ANDAL', '$JMIA', 'BUT', 'GUESS', 'WHAT', 'PRISE', 'ITRON', 'AND', 'CKREW', 'LONG', 'ON', 'THE', 'STOCK', 'AND', 'S', 'NO', 'RE', 'RTING', 'AGAIN', '$JMIA', 'I', 'OSSAL', 'JUST', 'GO', 'AND', 'SEE', 'THIS', 'ITS', 'RTANT', 'TO', 'GET', 'A', 'ROPER', 'RTANT', 'GME', 'BABLY', 'I', 'ANNOT', 'WAIT', 'TO', 'PROVE', 'WRONG', 'NOW', 'TARDS', 'KEEP', 'ADING', 'CAUSE', 'DO', 'NOT', 'GIVE', 'THE', 'BEARS', 'A', 'HANCE', 'TO', 'BUY', 'BUT', 'FEAR', 'I', 'AM', 'SO', 'PROUD', 'OF', 'EVERY', 'LAST', 'UTIST', 'ON', 'HERE', 'A', 'DR', 'HOLD', 'ON', 'TO', 'YOUR', 'TOCKS', 'WITH', 'AMOND', 'HANDS', 'HOARD', 'AND', 'HOLD', 'EVEN', 'A', 'RED', 'DAY', 'OR', 'TWO', 'T', 'GUISH', 'THE', 'FLAME', 'IN', 'WSB', 'LET', 'US', 'CKING', 'TAKE', 'OFF', 'TISTS', 'THIS', 'IS', 'RKING', 'RYONE', 'HOLD']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'HK', 'GME', 'TWO']

&#x200B;

Before I get into this, I need to say two things first. One, shorters will keep shorting, they're in too deep. Second, they will also do their absolute best to make ANYONE ELSE sell or short too, and they've had years of practice on how to manipulate people and to use the media to do it (including paid news articles).

# Reason 1: GME is a mall-store blockbuster (no future), will cite earnings reports

Please see this [very extensive Due Diligence (DD)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/) along with this [fascinating new development](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/). Also definitely worth an extensive read is [this amazing DD, on its own website](https://www.gmedd.com/).

GME is on a trajectory to do some pretty cool things, even without the short squeeze that has everyone excited. Long buyers are in. **News people are starting to pivot more and more as of Wednesday, they cannot deny the trajectory in the face of continued shorting.**

&#x200B;

Most likely things they will cite are:

1. Total sales declined 3.1% in the holiday sales report
2. Large 3rd quarter sales declines (pre-covid vs post-covid the most likely cause).
3. Closed 11% of stores (which they did to cut underperforming stores, and because their stores are FAR too dense, especially given an increased focus on E-commerce)
4. Unavailability of consoles (as if this has anything to do with Gamestop)

&#x200B;

Most likely things they will intentionally leave out:

1. Comparable store sales increased 4.8% in holiday report (so, decrease above likely because of store closures)
2. E-commerce is at 34% of company sales, equivalent to Best Buy percentage (and growing rapidly, and more rapidly than Best Buy)
3. Regional sales in Australia/New Zealand (no covid) went UP 31%

&#x200B;

# Reason 2: Insiders are selling

This is true. But here are the facts that they will leave out:

1/12/21-1/13/21: Hestia Capital (whose managing member is Wolf Kurt James) sold 945,550 shares of GME for this reason ""in order to better align with the maximum concentration guidelines for single stock investment of Hestia Capital"". The fund still owns 91,000 shares and Wolf Kurt James PERSONALLY AND DIRECTLY still owns 50,689 (including 20,000 of his wife's shares).

Also,

1/13/21: Dunn Lizabeth sold 5,000 shares of GME. She still owns 57,258.

1/13/21-1/15/21: Raul J Fernandez sold 31,119 shares of GME. He still owns 29,289 *\[updated\]*

1-13-21: Kathy P Vrabeck sold 50,000 shares of GME. She still owns 79,537.

The forms regarding the previous 3 people's sales were all filed by Dunn Lizabeth, suggesting that they sold as a coordinated choice. Also, all three of those people are NOT on the Board of Directors as proposed by RC Ventures (and conditionally agreed to by Gamestop, an agreement they'll almost definitely keep given the huge increases in share price upon RC Ventures' buy-in and policy changes that RC Ventures has strongly suggested/recommended)

Source: [SEC Filings](https://sec.report/Ticker/GME)

&#x200B;

# Reason 3: Some form of WSB bashing

1. They will likely ascribe most if not all of the upward trajectory of Gamestop to WSB. This is not entirely false: this subreddit, the repeated DDs on it, and people's ""rabid"" attention has indeed contributed to the upward trajectory. This is the age of the individual investor though, and the way media works has changed. There is nothing shady or inappropriate about large groups of people believing in something and then pursuing and/or betting on its success. This is exactly what the MM's do, the difference is that they have few people moving lots of money, and WSB has lots of people each moving a little money.
2. Y'all have been rude AF. Not saying anything against it, I'm just saying that there will be backlash to the kind of savagery we've seen against Citron and Melvin in the past few days. They will call you rabid, they will call you crazy idiots, they will call you insane gamblers, they will imply (but never say on air) that you are ""autists"" and ""retards""...and in ~~some~~ most cases, they'll even be right. However, I hope that anyone reading this who isn't a WSB fanatic will recognize that the movement of this stock, while inspired by such fanaticism, is not based on some rabid fanaticism alone (See #1, see the hundreds of tickers posted here every day).

&#x200B;

# Reason 4: The short squeeze has already happened

1. Now here, I expect them to throw up some fancy crayon data analysis looking at shares shorted or available to short or short interest % of daily trading or fees to short and try and pretend like that number really means that the shorts have already covered. Here's the important data (there's some in the DD in #1 as well).

First, [Short interest was higher than float as of EOD Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzwo2z/gme_short_interest_declined_to_71m_and_some_other/), and [still higher than float at EOD Tuesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l18jvw/gme_short_interest_update_703m_shares_short/), meaning there is an absolutely obscene # of shorted shares (a ""high"" number is often cited as 20-30%, we're at 100%). We'll see updated numbers for EOD Wednesday in the early morning. Short interest actually INCREASED during the Wed-Thurs time that Citron was originally saying was the short squeeze. Now, these are Ortex estimates based on the self-reported shares short at a large aggregate of brokerages, but have been very reliable  when compared to the official SEC data that comes out every half a month.

**Important Update here based on re-analysis.**

**The # of shorted shares from Wed-Fri was approximately 71.4M (approximately the current # of shares short). Citron's analysis will say that shorters have COVERED their original shorts, and what we are seeing now are NEW shorts at higher price points (less pressure). I think they are partially correct. However:**

**1) Shorters will have wanted to drive down price on Wed onward.** This means that the shorted shares are not necessarily new opened shorts that are still open, but may have been temporary shorts that were covered on the same day. We have seen a lot of temporary shorting in the past few days, so at least some of the shorts were due to this. In fact, I expect that a very large number of those 71.4M shorted shares were temporary shorts, based on the number of shares sold short each day over the past few months (millions per day) and the overall changes in the total number of shorted shares over the same period (almost none, relatively).

**2) Shorts have been re-opened.** The difference between their loss on a new short after covering an old short, or from holding the original short is the difference in price between those two shorts (could be as high as $20, but that's only for some of the shorts). However, **the fact that a similar level of % short/float exists today means that the EXACT SAME potential for a short squeeze is present** even if these are new shorts, but the pressure is somewhat lower as the current price MIGHT be closer to the short price.

**3) With GME's current trajectory (even if we discount Wednesday's meteoric rise and just look at the last 6 months), even those hypothetical higher price point shorts are still in significant danger.** If they weren't, we wouldn't be seeing this huge pushback from media and such aggressive market manipulation (see Tuesday's 2x1M share sell-offs).

BONUS) It's important to note that the borrowing fees, while not insignificant, are reasonably trivial for a large institution. It amounts to something like $0.03 per day per share, even at 30% on a $40 stock. They can hold for a month and if they make $1 per share, they're still up. However, this adds up. Also, eventually, the broker will need to fill real share buy orders and can force an immediate sale. Finally, if trajectory continues to go up, it just stops being worth trying to short it and someone will start a selling chain, driving up price.

&#x200B;

# Reason 5: More shares traded on some days than are short. Meaning days to cover is not close to accurate.

This is absolutely true. Days to cover is based on an average of the daily volume over the past few days. What they will say is that because daily volume is higher then shorts can cover very easily. Here's three reasons I disagree:

1. the volume shorted over the past week has consistently been around 20%+ of the daily volume. Therefore we can discount 20% of the volume as that has no net effect on the number of shorts.
2. any increase in volatility of a stock will lead to increased trading. That means more sellers, but also more buyers. **The days to cover metric is based ONLY on volume. That means that it assumes that every share bought is bought to replace a shorted share. That is unlikely to ever be the case, especially in today's market which is saturated by retail investors because of trading apps. They're using 1900s math in 2021.**
3. Trading volume has actually been decreasing since last Wednesday, while % short hasn't changed, so current volumes will mean more time to cover again compared to last Wednesday (even though days to cover isn't the greatest measure). So this is less and less in the shorters' favor as volume decreases, and we have a similar % short/float.

# So what will happen?

**THIS IS A GUESS. But, based on the sudden vanishing of shares available to short at IKBR at approximately the same time as the Citron announcement on Tuesday, I suspect tomfoolery. In addition, Citron just started doing these ""twitter Live"" things two days ago. Yes, GME wasn't the first one, but it's still a very recent new thing. At the same time, GME has had some barefaced manipulation these past few days on this sub and elsewhere in the media, not to mention the likely** [months of naked shorting](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky9mu0/gme_comrades_115_update_27_consecutive_days_on/). **Citron also conveniently decided to delay their twitter live for the inauguration, as they were hoping for a higher viewership (or potential viewership), which makes perfect sense, but still seems strange that on the SECOND LIVE TWITTER THEY DID (for the good of their viewers), THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE ELECTION.**

None of this happened yesterday because yesterday was a slightly lower volume day than usual, and their strategies to drive down price require maximum exposure. If they're very aggressive and trigger SEC Rule 201 again, they're limited in their shorting options on the next day.

Option 1: we have a repeat of Friday where shorters will try to immediately and early smash down GME price in hopes that it will keep going down after starting that trajectory. They can do this because SEC Rule 201 is not active (so they can short on a downtick again).

Option 2: Shorters will first allow stocks to rise as they did Tuesday. Then at around 11:30 (+/- 1 hour), GME will start to tank rapidly (potentially due again to some big 1M share sells). If it was me, I would time it and hit it very hard so it hits -10% for the day (the furthest they can push it by shorting on downticks) as close to the Citron announcement as possible, with the hopes that that livestream will then push retail shorters to short more or paper-handers to sell. Remember, due to puts expiring Friday, there is likely significant pressure on shorters to drive price below $35 or as close as they can asap.

Option 3: Small but steady downward pressure, in the hopes of making retail investors get bored and leave so that the stock price goes down.

Gamestop will also announce an influx of new consoles sometimes tomorrow. This helps push stock up, and I bet they time it to be right before Citron's twitter live if they can, and my personal hope is that there's something unexpected about this influx of new consoles (perhaps a larger number than usual due to a new deal?), but I don't expect this to have a super huge effect.

I‚Äôm working on another DD to add to my GME EndGame series ([part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/), [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/)), but I wanted to take an aside to share my speculations on the obscene amount of manipulation happening this week by the shorts, and try to give all of you advice on how you can be more successful on GME.

**TL:DR;** GME has tremendous potential and the only reason it‚Äôs not trading at $80+ is because of active shorting. Be aware about how your positions may be helping the shorts without you knowing.

# How shorts manipulated GME this week

I‚Äôm going to preface this by saying this is speculation based on events transpired and what I know about short tactics. Consider this a narrative of how a shorter could have orchestrated all of this. I will share data where I have it. For an understanding of some of those tactics, read this [great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l11ww7/legacy_of_wsb_jim_cramers_crash_course_in_gme/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by u/mirkan__2.

Imagine you‚Äôre one of the big shorts on GME. You‚Äôve been shorting this thing since 2017, 2018, 2019 and watched its stock price drop from 30 -> 15 -> 4 to a low of $3 in 2020. If you‚Äôre Bank of America, your analysts are telling you (and others) this [thing is going to $1](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/04/15848735/gamestops-short-term-sales-boost-to-power-down-soon-analyst-says).

But then things get out of hand, very quickly, with GME climbing from $3 -> $20 in 9 months and then in **ONE WEEK** doubling to $40. You were not prepared for this. It‚Äôs a disaster.

What do you do? You leverage every tactic you can to drive the price down.

**1) Attack retail investing capabilities:**

* Bank of America owns Merrill Lynch. Merrill Lynch has a retail brokerage. Since you‚Äôre short GME, you have your risk department over at Merrill Edge **increase the margin requirements on GME** strongly and suddenly on all retail buyers.
* **This causes a chain reaction**. Brokerages generally mimic the margin changes on other brokerages, because they don‚Äôt want to be the ones where all the ‚Äúrisky‚Äù traders go to. So other brokerages start increasing their requirements. Pretty soon, Schwab, Fidelity, Ameritrade, IBKR have all increased their margin requirements to the point that many buyers cannot buy more shares, or if they had bought on margin, need to liquidate or provide more capital.
* Meanwhile, the big guys - banks and hedge funds that are short - use [prime brokerages](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-prime-brokerage-4165497), and since I don‚Äôt have access to one I can‚Äôt confirm, but *very much doubt had any margin changes to GME.*

**2) Manipulative shorting:**

* On **Friday (1/15)** you take advantage of the fact that most call buyers on GME are not going to take assignment, so as they sell their calls which are now worth huge sums of money, Market-makers (MMs) are going to sell the shares they‚Äôre using to hedge the calls. So you short the stock as hard as you can, driving it down as low as 14% at one point, but it creates too strong of a sell-off triggering a short-sale restriction.

Great, at this point, you think you‚Äôve killed some of the momentum going into the 3-day weekend. Hopefully investors will realize more of their mistake and sell off their foolish investment in the next Blockbuster. But then things go awry. Retail buyers are not shaken. In fact they‚Äôre enraged, and the GME movement grows more popular than ever, becoming the [most mentioned ticker](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1ey7e/heres_a_visualization_of_the_tomorrows_moves/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and even getting a stickied thread each day.

The US markets are closed on Monday. Doesn‚Äôt matter. Europe takes the mantle, driving the price up from 35 at close on Friday in the US to 40, then 44. **Mexico** picks up the baton, where it hits 1000 pesos, or **$50/share on Monday at 11:30 a.m.** before coming back down a bit.

&#x200B;

You‚Äôre about to get squeezed and you need to do something fast. You can‚Äôt short the price down Tuesday in US trading because of the short sale restriction, and the momentum behind GME is palpable.

So now you get more aggressive.

**3) Orchestrated media attack & shorting:**

* Here‚Äôs what you have to work with. There are **at least** **1.2 million** shares available to short in just IBKR, and more in prime brokerages thanks to all the retail buyers buying shares in Robinhood. [‚ÄúRobinhood Securities earns income from lending margin securities to counterparties.‚Äù](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/how-robinhood-makes-money/#:~:text=Robinhood%20Securities%20earns%20income%20from%20lending%20margin%20securities%20to%20counterparties.) At a **54% borrow rate,** that‚Äôs quite a nice return for RH for holding your shares.
* You call up a famous shorter known for impacting equity prices - Andrew Left of Citron. Offer him tons of money to put out a hit piece on Tuesday after markets open. It doesn‚Äôt matter that he doesn‚Äôt have shit prepared and you need him to do this tomorrow. He‚Äôs just going to threaten an attack to kill the momentum.
* Tuesday market opens. GME **rockets up 25% to $45/share** within the first few minutes. Then comes the orchestrated attack.
   * Minutes before Citron‚Äôs tweet, you buy thousands of OTM puts.
      * **1000** 1/22 40p - **26 minutes before the tweet**
      * **472** 2/29 20p - **24 minutes before the tweet**
      * **2200** 1/29 30p - **11 minutes before the tweet**
      * **424** 1/22 40p - **10 minutes before the tweet**
      * **449** 1/22 40p - **5 minutes before the tweet**

[Biggest option trades on the day of Citron‚Äôs tweet. Note that almost all of the large, long option orders are longer term, but the puts are all short term, with many coming minutes before the tweet. Keep in mind, while all this aggressive, OTM, short-term expiry put buying was happening, GME was rocketing upwards. It‚Äôs pretty obvious this was planned and not a response to price action. ](https://preview.redd.it/a9naysrkxmc61.png?width=939&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac257a1212129b1aa7d234a77cb563498a4d4fd8)

* At 9:58 a.m. eastern (I‚Äôm on the west coast so timestamp is different), comes the tweet

https://preview.redd.it/jupelyppxmc61.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=08dc187be8fdd580bd418c43f682e526e5c346d1

* Note the language here:
   * Citron‚Äôs not revealing anything until tomorrow, when short sale restrictions are done. *I.e. you better not buy today!*
   * Price target of $20 **matching exactly the lowest strike price of the puts purchased just minutes prior**.
   * ‚ÄúI understand short interest better than you‚Äù - i.e. ‚Äúthe shorts are paying me and I know who they are, and why they‚Äôre shorting‚Äù
   * ‚ÄúPoker game‚Äù - ***he‚Äôs calling you a sucker, while at the same time tweeting a poker bluff***\*\*.\*\* He doesn‚Äôt actually have anything ready or substantial, but the shorts paid him off to threaten the market.
* Andrew Left fired his shot. Now comes the coordinated shorting.
* In about an hour, **all 1.2 million shares** in Interactive Brokers are used up.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f6do9e7txmc61.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=1017e67af75f3f85fc98425aa5b6154b255cd5c1

* Probably, prior to this, shorts used the invisible shares available from brokerages like Robinhood.
* Wait, shorts can‚Äôt short on restricted days, right? **Wrong.**
   * **They can short on the ask.**
   * When there‚Äôs fear in the market, organic sellers lower their ask to exit their positions.
   * Shorts high-frequency algos move their ask to match the lowest organic ask.
   * Organic seller really needs to get rid of these shares! Citron is coming! Sees he‚Äôs now not the lowest ask, so he moves it down.
   * Guess what? The algos match his ask and short at the lower price now.
   * **This cycle repeats as long as organic sellers reduce their asks to sell.**
* While all this is happening, **market makers are shorting/selling shares in response to the puts placed prior to the tweet,** helping push down the price.

Congratulations. **In a matter of less than an hour, GME has now dropped from $45 to $37/share - an 18% drop and an** ***absolutely incredible reversal of momentum.***

Citron didn‚Äôt even have to do shit. The next day they canceled their livestream claiming they *forgot about the fucking inauguration.*

# How to be smart

As you can see, there are a number of dirty tricks here. It‚Äôs sophisticated, coordinated, and the odds are stacked against the retail investor.

There are some things you can do to trade smarter.

* **OPEX.** Imagine if every trader out there took profits of their calls at expiration. In that scenario, MMs sell the shares they used the hedge the calls, leading to a downward drift in price. If instead people rolled forward winning calls, for example, MMs would not necessarily sell the hedge (depends on delta). Selling calls before expiry if you just want to take profits sometimes means you can avoid a drop on OPEX.
* **Robinhood lends your shares and doesn't pay you for it.** Some other brokers let you choose to lend your shares. I know I can choose to lend shares or not in IBKR. It‚Äôs up to you to lend or not, but don‚Äôt let your broker lend for you and earn all that free lending money.
* **Don‚Äôt sell on dips.** You‚Äôre only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when it‚Äôs heading up. *Sell high, not low retards.*
* **Save dry powder to buy on dips.** Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities. Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points. GME has incredible daily volatility. Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill. **Have patience when buying.**
* **Don‚Äôt buy calls on rips.** With everyone expecting a squeeze *at any moment* option premiums that are already high rocket to insane levels in minutes. When Citron canceled their livestream GME started to recover, call premiums skyrocketed. You‚Äôre absolutely fucked if you buy calls on rips, even if you‚Äôre right. Look at this call premium price history for today and *imagine just how fucked you are if you buy calls on rips*:

[Good luck profiting on calls if you buy on rips. ](https://preview.redd.it/hsofwiv5ymc61.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b7ee04c148c095e1f47613ded22844460fe768c)

* **Don‚Äôt advertise when you‚Äôre going to buy. Just buy dips.** There were so many folks saying ‚Äúwait for 11:30 to buy!‚Äù. Well, look what happened! Just when you thought there‚Äôd be a dip, and you were all ready to buy, there was this magical, temporary rapid price spike. Congratulations, advertised to every predatory trader out there when you all were going to buy. Double-win for them: If you fomo‚Äôd in at 41 you‚Äôre probably gonna paper hands your way out when the shorts push it back down.
* **Don‚Äôt buy more than you‚Äôre willing to lose.** You need to hold through the dips, and be ok with the extreme volatility. IF you put too much into this all at once, you‚Äôre going to get scared when the price goes against you.
* **Consider exercising DEEP ITM calls.** I love u/DeepFuckingValue but he could be making more from his portfolio. He has $2.6M in cash from prior GME winnings but also 1000 April 12 calls. The april 12 calls **are trading at intrinsic value.** Exercising those calls right now would use up $1.2M of capital and add 100K shares to his account, but 1) it would not change the PnL of the portfolio, 2) would increase the liquidity (you lose on spreads when you try to sell deep itm calls), and 3) **would allow him to choose whether or not to lend the shares.** Right now, MMs have hedged his calls with 100K shares, **but they're lending them to shorts and making free money.** In the case of DFV, that's about **$6000 per day** in free money given to market makers for the privilege of lending his shares to shorts. **If you have the cash, and the options trading at intrinsic, consider exercising.** Whether you lend is up to you, but **don't give MMs free money.**

[u\/DeepFuckingValue's Portfolio. Exercising the April 12 calls would not impact his PnL, would increase liquidity, and would give him the option of lending shares \(and earning money\) or not. ](https://preview.redd.it/37hwj00gymc61.png?width=2804&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf3bb9864aee06d5d8c379b3413da2d6a7c7071a)

&#x200B;

* **HOLD.** There is so much upside in GME, *that it doesn‚Äôt matter what price you buy now if you have patience.* There are so many potential catalysts coming and if all of this dirty behavior is any evidence shorts are scared and looking for cheap buys to get out. **Don‚Äôt give up your shares for cheap.** Here‚Äôs a quick list of potential catalysts that could happen at any time and any of which would spell more pain for shorts:
   * Share recall for a vote on major issue
   * Cohen becomes CEO
   * Alan, Jim (chewy directors added to board) purchase shares (they are not limited in how many they can buy)
   * Cohen could buy his remaining 7%
   * New higher $ investors pile in
      * In my [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) I talked about how vc investors were going to start piling in and lo and behold a couple days later [one VC explained why he was buying gme](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/) with a potential price target of **$800/share**
      * [This guy](https://twitter.com/KjetillStjerne) who is invested in GME and claims to have 9 figure wealth (might also be [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/l17ic7/gme_145m_shares_not_selling_go_longs/)) [convinces billionaire friends](https://twitter.com/KjetillStjerne/status/1352084214162849803?s=20) to buy into gme now for both the sheet asymmetric nature and to fight back against citron
   * Debt upgrade
      * GME‚Äôs 2021 bond is done is March, the removal of which has many restrictive covenants
      * Getting to profitability and reducing debt may trigger a debt upgrade by Moody‚Äôs and unlock more institutional ownership

All of you need to have faith. **Even after all these shady tactics, GME is still up 9% from close on Friday.**"|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001738.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['DD', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'ONE', 'GME', 'IBKR', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'US', 'US', 'US', 'GME', 'IBKR', 'RH', 'GME', 'OTM', 'OTM', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'OPEX', 'OPEX', 'I', 'I', 'IBKR', 'GME', 'GME', 'IF', 'DEEP', 'ITM', 'I', 'M', 'GME', 'M', 'K', 'L', 'K', 'DFV', 'L', 'HOLD', 'GME', 'CEO', 'I', 'VC', 'GME', 'GME']|['DD', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'IBKR', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'IBKR', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'IBKR', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'VC', 'GME', 'GME']

The issue here is that the creation of a single identity will be our destruction. There's people framing us as if we prop up stocks, or are attempting to (as if we make gains?). They're exploiting our collective strength and we're playing right into it. I heard He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named saying that we are going to ""attack"" Citron with a planned surge of purchasing right after their livestream.

While this is fun to think about, and it's amazing we can go against the best, they're just setting us up to get taken down. I don't want WSB to be seen as an organized entity, which we really aren't. We need to stay loose like my wife after my mom's boyfriend is done with her. I'm worried that the spotlight we're getting with the strength we've developed will really just be the end of something amazing.

SO what can we do?

STOP saying stupid shit.

STOP acting as if we actually affect the market.

First, u/trap_zack mentioned:

>**ELY** **pt raise from $30 to $40, reit Buy @ JEFF -** US rounds played have continued to accelerate through the back half of '20, and we expect robust demand for the sport will continue for the foreseeable future as consumers' leisure time and spend face lessened competition. Recall, key to this strength in golf participation has been a surge in beginner play, of which the benefit to equipment sales likely extends over the medium-term as these new players invest in the game over time.

u/Throwerofrock mentioned:

>Callaway buys back old sets of clubs from their customers, gives them a credit towards new sets of clubs, and sends/sells the old clubs to be used at TopGolf. This is quite literally the best business model I can imagine. I've been playing it like an idiot since it dipped, now I'm in for shares. Fuck it.

u/MisterSlippers did some personal investigation:

>I have a golf course in my back yard, I see at least 8 dudes golfing outside right now, if you figure 12 callaway clubs per bag 8 \* 12 = 96 EOM.

VIAC is the pick of the year!|t3_l21526|0.55|9|9|controversial|2021-01-21 18:56:35.000000|greggo92|74|DD|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l21526/sound_the_alarm_viac_is_the_pick_of_the_year/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l21526/sound_the_alarm_viac_is_the_pick_of_the_year/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l21526/sound_the_alarm_viac_is_the_pick_of_the_year/|"I‚Äôve been trying to inform the great community for the past 2 months. VIAC is the next big pick for WSB and the markets are taking notice before the WSB can get in on the fun. 

Yes I‚Äôm trying to help! Yes I want the tendies! And yes you probably think this is stupid, what are you talking about GME all day bro. TSLA to the moon bro. 

No stop it. I‚Äôm talking about one of the most undervalued stocks in the hottest market segment, no this is not a motley fool boomer pitch, this is Viacomcbs. This is the fucking rocket ship. We are looking at a 4-5 x return once streaming potential is even partially realized.

Little secret, VIAC is n third place in streaming with 18 million paid subs. Other plays are stuck with their botched launch, VIAC has 2 services that have been profitable and open for 6 plus years. CBS All access soon to be paramount plus and showtime. 

The biggest play for the company isn‚Äôt paid streaming although it will be a huge piece of business. No the real opportunity is in Pluto TV which is the leading FREE AD SUPPORTED STREAMING TELEVISION. FAST. 

Fast is free tv paid for by ads. It‚Äôs basically the internet‚Äôs version of a 2005 cable box from Comcast. 

You have so much old content that can still generated revenue. Look at the recent Netflix VIAC deal
For narcos on Pluto or look at the library content they have. 

I am trying my best but it‚Äôs hard to break through the loud voices of GME right now. 

I would hate to see y‚Äôall miss this boat, it‚Äôs finally becoming safe enough for me to want to mention it. The turnaround is finally underway for real and we are still at the beginning. 

The Investor day is 2-24-2021 and that‚Äôs the big trade right there. 

I‚Äôm about to buy more options for 3-19 45c 50c 52.5c as well as leaps and some equity. Almost all in over 20k at risk. 

This is your moment to break the shackles of your losses. If you are sick because you missed GME or TSLA or any other big profitable moves this is your chance. 

I can‚Äôt help but feel like no one is gonna pay any attention until it‚Äôs too late to buy but y‚Äôall can‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt try and raise the alarm. 

All traders need to pay attention and look for new ideas. Not just OTM calls on TSLA and GME. 

I am using OTM calls for this as well but it‚Äôs much safer with ITM calls."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001800.csv|StockTicker|['VIAC']|[]|['VIAC', 'WSB', 'WSB', 'I', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'VIAC', 'VIAC', 'CBS', 'TV', 'FREE', 'AD', 'ORTED', 'AMING', 'ISION', 'FAST', 'VIAC', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'I', 'I', 'OTM', 'TSLA', 'GME', 'I', 'OTM', 'ITM']|['GME', 'TSLA', 'CBS', 'FREE', 'FAST', 'GME', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'GME']

People who are downvoted get their posts and comments hidden and eventually get muted, and Karma does motivate people to seek upvotes. The best examples are how r/politics become completely blue dominated with no alternative views, or people will post things on r/nottheonion and the comments get dominated as if it is r/politics. Alongside this, you see a gradual reduction in nuance, which in r/politics became ""mango bad"".  You see this throughout other subs on non-political topics once a tribal identity forms, and there is a strong tribal narrative on one side of an issue, and then people passionately downvote anything not in agreement.

On WSB, the mods banned political comments to prevent this kind of tribal BS seeping into the sub. But, we are starting to get extremely tribal about specific meme stocks to the point where it's very difficult to get quality DD on the other end of the issue. An awful lot of top posts do not have humor value as memes, and are basically - <ticker I YOLOed my entire account into>  üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ  followed by trash talk about some skeptic somewhere. I feel like arguing with people about a hot ticker now is like arguing with an anti-vaxxer friend about Moderna, or a blue friend about Mango's actual governmental actions, or a red friend about vote counting. It's really hard to be constructive or for anyone to get smarter.

If the goal of this sub is to collectively pump particular stocks, I guess this is true to form, but if the goal of this sub includes discussion to inform better trading outcomes for participants, this dynamic is greatly reducing the quality of trading discussion. Right now, the feed is almost exclusively just two tickers, and those threads have very few contrary views, even well thought out ones. When well thought-out comments are added that are not rockets and buy buy buy and either correct inaccuracies in the post or provide a reasoned alternative perspective, they get downvoted out of visibility. Even 4 or 5 months ago, I felt this sub was a lot different than stocktwits, but it's hard to tell the difference sometimes now.  I really want to be part of a community where we consistently find insight and trades that everyone else thought was dumb but was in reality brilliant, and that holds up some time later. The GME value thesis at $5 is one of those. So too was BTFDing the pandemic, and shorting it too.

I think this current tribalism is going to lead to worse trading outcomes for the sub in the long run. When we front-run a big wave of increasing bid on a stock, and then that price becomes stable or we exit before it's not, we outperform the market. That happened big time last year with Coronavirus, and has happened repeatedly with TSLA. In other cases we try to forget, it's been the opposite, like multiple times ahead of AMD earnings, PRPL, and over-exuberance with PLTR into the 30s. Basically, if we pump the stock, and then the broader community of investors doesn't come around to the point of view, we are stuck with the bag. And a lot of these outcomes come from when we are all-in and super emotional about it, which I think we all know is NOT how to trade if you want the best results.

We should stop downvoting posts and comments that are well written, and instead leave them alone or up vote them. By all means, downvote bullshit troll posts and straight up haters, but if you downvote quality contrary views, you make everyone here a worse trader, and increase the echo chamber that leads the sub to over-extend."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001727.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['WSB', 'BS', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'TSLA', 'AMD', 'PRPL', 'PLTR', 'I', 'NOT']|['DD', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'AMD']

I started in 2017 with like 30k of my own money and over the course of 3 years, spent probably a couple hundred hours learning about stocks, options, doing ""research"" etc. Today, I am down 8k since i started in 2017.

Proof: https://imgur.com/8zoihg7

(shows -60k but I was down -30k yesterday already on the calls)

That was money I planned on using for a downpayment on a house, and for paying my taxes on gains from last year. So once February comes around, the 20k I have left is basically going to taxes on gains from last year which are now gone. I am effectively broke :-)

Im not that upset because I have a decent paying job.. but god damn, I was literally just contacting real estate agents last week because I was planning on buying a house. I could still buy one, but it will probably take me years to get back to 100k in savings.

I should have just stuck to selling puts like I was doing for the past couple months. The gains aren't huge, but selling 100k worth of puts every week is enough to make you a couple G's every month with not a ton of risk. I could have made my future mortgage payments just selling puts.

I am trying to look on the bright side. Having 100k made me spend somewhat frivolously. Like eating out twice a day, buying clothes i didn't need, etc. Now I have to go back to scrimping and scraping, which is good I think. I was getting a little ridiculous.

Also, I have been finishing up my degree online but have had no motivation since I already have a decent job and decent money saved. Im feeling the pressure now to hurry up and finish my degree so I can get a better job (100k+ a year).

I went all in on $390 1/22 SPY calls yesterday. I did the math; if we would have had a 1.5% day today, I would have made about 500k.. but it was pretty flat so at open, I was already down a shit ton. Figuring there was no chance left, I pulled out what was left, about 47k. I saw ford was going up crazy and figured that was pretty much my only chance to get back to where I was. Basically bought calls expiring tomorrow at the top, started going down, I pushed out and sold. So now I have 20k.

I'm not super depressed about it or anything because I know ill be fine, but I already miss the coziness of having 100k stored away. Knowing that if I lost my job or something, id be okay. But like I said, Im looking on the bright side.

My goal at the moment is to just save as much money as possible, pay my taxes in February, and then start over.
Not even gonna lie, if I didn't need the 20k to pay taxes on last years gains, Id probably yolo it into something crazy. It's better to feel like this than nothing at all. Kinda fucked but whatever man, life is just boring.


***EDIT*** Honestly guys, I could go all in GME shares but even if it goes up 100% this year, I will only be at 40k.. which is already far fetched. Do any of you seriously believe GME is going up 500% this year? Maybe. Maybe you're right.. Maybe I need to go all in shares, defer paying my taxes for as long as possible, and hope for the best. God you guys give me hope.

***EDIT 2*** 

**ALRIGHT, so im going all in shares on something and just holding long. Half of you faggies are saying GME, half are saying BB. Which fucking one is it? I can't risk any options plays at the moment**.


***EDIT: Went all in GME this morning, already up 50% to 30k.

To begin with, I am truly impressed with all the hard-work you guys put in whilst creating quality memes, due diligence posts, twitter messages and online presence.

But all being said, in the past couple of days we can notice the mentioning of /r/wallstreetbets come up in various ways within the social media - like twitter and benzinga, CNBC, youtube. The fact that we created a twitter account and collectively try and display our voice as an individual plays a huge downside to us. Now we are one, now we are acting as an institution, as a fund, as a united society - keep in mind guys that these notions are easily manipulated in the social media and it is way easier to target a single unified voice than it is to target a bunch of random individuals. When it comes to our beloved stocks like $BB, $PLTR, $GME it is important to highlight the fact of our **individual purchases**, **individual subscriptions** to their services, individual DDs and so much more. By silently increasing our positions as separate human beings, by silently promoting companies we are able to dish out more fire power which cannot be harassed online as we are under a cloak of shadow.

Pardon my broken English, but I hope you get the notch - WSB should not be a team or a gang - it should be all different individuals just sharing the same vision. **We must not respond to online media callouts**, we must not pay too much attention to news portals and videos calling us out. It only gives a negative outcome and makes us more vulnerable, thus allowing bears and other dipshit analysts to use WSB against their own stocks - detract other individuals/entities that may be interested in the stock by displaying us as a gang of monkeys.

I hope this message reaches some of you out, I have seen similar messages already hanging, but wanted to share my voice and remind you all - **we achieved such astounding results by acting separately** and based on a solid DD, **not by acting as a single unit**. Thank you and god bless this community.

**EDIT**: a very nice way to put it is to compare us to a beehive. It is way easier to eliminate a whole group of bees when they are in a single unit, however it is way more difficult to act against bees that are roaming free within the nature and may sting from various angles. **The unseen weapon is the deadliest.**"|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001723.csv|StockTicker|['WSB']|[]|['IGHLY', 'STOP', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'CNBC', '$BB', '$PLTR', '$GME', 'I', 'WSB', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'DD']|['GME', 'DD']

Go easy on me fellow WSB. I also put a lot of üöÄüöÄüöÄ here but pleaseeee do your own DD if you're gonna buy $BB)

**Intro:**

Most people look at Blackberry (formerly known as RIM) as a dead cellphone company. A company that‚Äôs basically a prehistoric dinosaur at this point with a small cybersecurity portfolio left of their business. Their inability to adapt against cell phone companies such as Apple & Android vendors has caused their main revenue driver to plummet into non-existence. However, their business has been able to keep afloat in the past few years due to their competitive advantages around cybersecurity. Many government officials & corporations till this day still use QNX from BB as their mobile/security platform due to these advantages.

**Word on the street:**

Around last year summer, word on the street was that BB is looking to partner with Amazon on a EV platform around data sensors, automation, and cybersecurity. Stock prices at the time was around $4-6 CAD. Just looking at financials alone and the amount of $ revenue they bring in compared to the industry standards, $BB stock price seemed quite undervalued in comparison. However, this made sense since $BB has failed to deliver and disappointed shareholders over the past years.

Whether we‚Äôd like to believe it or not -- EV (electric vehicle) is the future in the next 5 years. Whether that is one day where we run out of fossil fuel‚Ä¶ or people moving towards environmentally friendly options, there is much to be explored and the market is relatively immature.

In today‚Äôs world, every automotive company is chasing EV currently and wants to avoid becoming the next ‚ÄúBlockbuster‚Äù prehistoric company. The question we need to ask next is, ‚ÄúDo they have the necessary tools & solutions to help them transition in that journey?‚Äù To answer this, I will give a quick example. Most farmers do not build a tractor to farm their crops. They instead go out and buy one than to waste precious time seeing their crops die. I believe this holds true for automotives as they lack the necessary skill sets to develop a platform that can run cybersecurity, data sensors, and automation for their cars. If you didn‚Äôt know already, popular car services such as Apple‚Äôs CarPlay and Google‚Äôs Android Auto all already operate on top of QNX today in our cars today. Amazon‚Äôs partnership will only help accelerate that movement as QNX will be linked to their public cloud to do over-the-air monitoring, upgrade, security, collision crashing assistance, autonomous driving, AI machine learning, and many many more.

**What‚Äôs happened recently**:

Well‚Ä¶ their partnership with Amazon came true around December. In addition to this, they‚Äôve sold off their üí© cell phone patents to Huawei so they can finally focus purely on Cybersecurity and EV.

Icing to the cake, they‚Äôve recently won a settlement against Facebook so they gotta pay up that $$$ to $BB which hasn‚Äôt been reflected in their quarterly report yet.

SpaceX, Zoom, Qualcomm, governments, and many more are working with $BB as we speak today. Sony recently just announced their partnership with $BB for their next upcoming car last week. Overall, lots of exciting news back to back.

This explains the excitement around $BB and why it‚Äôs been taking off recently. I believe they will continue to do so as the EV and Cybersecurity market continues to evolve from its infancy. (With other digital ""currencies"" growing, would there be a bigger cybersecurity play for $BB? Who knows)

**So.. what are the Risks:**

3 things I can think of currently:

1. No Revenue Growth despite all of the above
2. EV doesn‚Äôt take off as much as it should. COVID is impacting sales of cars or sales of anything in general. Self-explanatory there
3. Someone creates a better platform over $BB

This all depends if $BB is capable of hiring great salespeople to execute on their job. Only time will tell.

**TLDR; In Conclusion**

Most boomers will avoid $BB because they think it‚Äôs a cellphone company. Anyone that‚Äôs googled it recently will know that this isn‚Äôt true. I personally think $BB is very undervalued and with the reasons I‚Äôve explained above, I feel there‚Äôs much potential for the company to grow. Lots of people are going to be selling it when there‚Äôs a bit of a profit but I think the company‚Äôs barely scratched it‚Äôs potential.

Finally, the ret‚Ä¶.s WSB from reddit are using lingos such as ‚Äúto the moon‚Äù and ‚ÄúRockets üöÄüöÄ‚Äù for $BB so we all know people are dumping hard on this to make it the next big thing.

I think I did the title right, and now I'm supposed to open by saying, listen up retards, here's why INSG is THE play to make.

Technicals (chart below if you want to look):

Two +20% days in the last 2 weeks, and RSI still just below 80. Closed above previous resistance at $18. Still good amount of room to run.

Volume is thicc. Avg volume over the past month has substantially increased.

MACD just crossed signal line on increased volume.

Volume by price shows increase in buy:sell volume ratio at recent price levels.

Fundamental indicators (is this where I say for the üåàüêª):

EPS increased by at least 10% every quarter in the past year. Consensus EPS estimate for 2021 is .17, significant because it's the first positive annual EPS and also 400% higher than 2020 consensus of -0.6. News below should explain why.

YoY quarterly revenue growth of 43.9%.

Price/sales ratio of 3.38 last reported quarter. Low as balls.

Let‚Äôs start with the summary.

# Tldr;

* VW-like MOASS is likely to happen regardless of whether we üíéhand or not; and whether we keep stocks in cash vs margin. Pussy üßªüñêare not going to make the squeeze any weaker but rather they will just miss out on the best part.
* The true float is not enough to cover all shorts. (not new, but detailed holding breakdown below)
* The most violent part of the squeeze is likely to happen on the last 1-2 days of the squeeze, not the beginning. 
* The end (peak) of the squeeze is not in our hands as much as it is in the hands of large institutional holders, insiders or a company offering.
* üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

**Disclaimer**: I‚Äôm a simple retard trying to understand the mechanics of the market. This is not advice on what to do. If you have input your feedback is welcome.

# Float deep dive

Previous DDs suggested that the violence of the squeeze depends on the ratio between shorted shares and available shares they can buy to cover. 

I wanted to understand exactly what this ratio is like right now and going into the squeeze. The purpose of this exercise for me was to gather data available on all holdings (institutions, insiders and mutual funds) to find out exactly how much float there is.

## True float 

Before looking at the data, let‚Äôs talk about float vs true float. True float is a word I came up with to help myself understand how many shares are available for shorters to purchase.

As mentioned in previous DDs, each 1 share sold short creates another synthetic long share. This explains why the total shares in the market are larger than the number of shares issued by the company.

Thus, the true float = share float + synthetic longs from each short

= share float + short interest = \~117M

Now, let‚Äôs take a look at how much of that true float is available to trade. I‚Äôve compiled this sheet below to break down the holdings of insiders, mutual funds and institutional holdings. Note that this doesn‚Äôt account for WSB holdings.

&#x200B;

## Observations

* Insiders and institutional holdings alone account for more than 100% of the company issued shares. 
   * In other words, the shorts simply cannot cover their shorts from the market alone. 
   * This is what previous DD‚Äôs referred to as negative float.
*  The share/float ratio currently is roughly 2.3:1

# Why I don‚Äôt think holding in cash vs margin makes much of a difference

The premise from previous DD‚Äôs is that holding in cash accounts and not margin means shorters can no longer borrow the stocks to short further. This is absolutely correct. 

Essentially, my understanding is shorters can borrow any share from the ‚Äútrue float‚Äù  (including synthetic longs) to short sell it again. They can just keep shorting the stock forever pretty much if they have infinite money.

Eventually, some of those synthetic longs created by shorting will arrive in a üíéhand cash account, which reduces the amount of borrowable shares from the true float.

Thus, available to short for shorters= True float - cash account üíéhand shares.

When the shares available to short are reduced, they become hard to borrow and brokers raise borrow rates on them. This makes shorters bleed faster.

While I agree that holding in cash account makes shorters bleed faster, I don‚Äôt think it makes a difference in the eventual occurrence of the squeeze because:

1. Shorters don‚Äôt have infinite money to keep shorting it forever. 
2. I‚Äôd expect brokers would raise borrow rates regardless of borrow availability since shorting a fast climbing stock has a high risk and the stock is climbing very fast.
3. It‚Äôs obvious that the sentiment is shifting very positively in the favor of GME. Anyone trying to short it further at this point is playing with fire and risking bankruptcy.
4. Once the squeeze starts, it should get very violent. Shorting this stock during it‚Äôs squeeze sounds like suicide so I‚Äôm speculating no new shorts will be open during the squeeze until news of an offering or something comes out.

In other words, buying on margin seems equally good to me if you‚Äôre considering it. But if you can keep your shares in cash, go for it as it may bleed the shorters sooner rather than later.

# Why I think VW-like MOASS is still likely to happen even though the current short:float ratio is not like VW

The short:float ratio is not constant.

Since insiders, institutions and mutual funds hold over 100% of the float, it seems to be the case that the entirety of our shares are synthetic longs created due to shorts.

As shorts cover, synthetic long shares disappear from the market. As the true float grows smaller, the ratio between the remaining shorts needed to cover and the remaining float will change.

To imagine this, I created a chart to try to visualize what happens to the short/float ratio during the squeeze for different possibilities of days to cover.

Since it‚Äôs hard for me to predict how many shorts will cover exactly each day, I made some basic assumptions:

* Let‚Äôs assume that for D days to cover, each day will see (SI / D) shorts covered. In other words, the shorts will be covered evenly over the days to cover.
   * This probably isn‚Äôt very accurate. In reality I expect the shorts covered to start small then increase dramatically each day due to margin calls.
   * If anything, I‚Äôd imagine this means reality should be more violent than this chart.
* Let‚Äôs assume insiders and institutions will sell 20% of their holdings prior to or during the squeeze
   * 20% makes it more of a worst case scenario.
   * I see how it makes sense to think that insiders and institutional holders would want to take advantage of the situation and sell more.
   * However, if those people have anything close to even a fresh grad intern working on this, they should understand that by holding longer they are creating fortunes for themselves.
* Let‚Äôs assume no new short positions will be opened during the squeeze
   * This seems straightforward. Can you imagine someone shorting VW during its squeeze? They would be out of their mind. 
   * Even if someone is that crazy, I‚Äôd expect brokers would have skyrocketing fees.

Following the above assumptions, I created the following tables. Each table represents the outstanding SI, the available to trade float, and short:available ratio respectively.

To visualize the data above, let‚Äôs put it on a chart. Y axis is short:float ratio.

&#x200B;

 

Observations

1. The short:float ratio becomes somewhat exponential as time passes due to supply shortage.
   1. NOTE: It looks like the lines end early at small values. Don't fret, this simply means there are no shares available anymore after this day, aka the line tends to infinity.
2. The squeeze becomes way more violent, more violent than VW, on later days (especially past 2-3 days) for all of different hypothetical values of days to cover.
3. In all scenarios, there will become a point at which there are simply no shares available (negative) for short positions to purchase to cover.

Point (3) here is what makes this squeeze an infinity squeeze like a previous DD called it. Essentially, at this point remaining short positions are at the mercy of insiders, institutions, mutual funds or a company offering. Heck, even the offering of $100M may not be enough shares to cover the remaining short positions when the price skyrockets.

I‚Äôm just a retard trying to wrap my head around this to arrive at this observation. However it‚Äôs safe to assume all of the above entities should be completely aware of this situation and the possibility of an infinity squeeze. I don‚Äôt see why they wouldn‚Äôt want to take advantage of this situation to name their price. Institutions could sell out and make deals with Melvin and shorters but they would be acting against their self interest; I'm assuming they can just get paid by brokers even if Melvin et al. go bankrupt.

My conclusion - 

The infinity squeeze is somewhat inevitable. It may likely start small. Once it starts, it will keep getting more violent each day. If shorts start covering and the stock skyrockets, chances are it will skyrocket aggressively further each day for the next 2-3 days until institutional holdings sell or the company announces an offering which seem unlikely to start early.

Positions: \~8,000 shares, no limit orders set. Company fair value in my book is >$100 without a squeeze.

**The questions you should be asking...**

People have left out all the fund traded shares that are owned (likely locked into place unless it moons and they have to rebalance). You're leaving out all the synthetic shares floating out around because of the shorts, and the facts the institutions or their allies are front running those shorts likely. Citron has also ignited a fight with some funds that have a bone to pick.

You're leaving out that the shorts also ARE NOT GETTING DELIVERED. Just because a broker has the shares on their books to short does NOT mean those shares are delivered.

How do I know? [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

GameStop's been on it far too long.

But brokers don't give a fuck, because SEC doesn't give enough of a fuck to do anything about it. They also don't give a FUCK about you. They only give a fuck with someone that matters enough does something wrong enough that someone else who matters enough gets hurt. Why did Elon get charged? There were a few institutions betting against it, remember?

&#x200B;

**Questions for you**

Have you checked institutional inflow estimates? Have you checked L2 aggregated orders? Have you peeked at the bulk order flows?

Do you actually have any idea how fucked the shorts are? Because if you did, you'd second mortgage your fucking house and put it on the line (do **NOT** do this you fucking idiot, it's a figure of speech).

&#x200B;

**General thesis as of today:**

* Institutions are fighting each other, not just us
* Enough people have enemies within Wall Street, they're willing to pad their bottom lines after a year like we've had if the risk is minimal and greater for the other side (because one side has to give in first, humans can only take so much punishment)
* Citron is obviously, blatantly manipulating the stock via the methods I describe below (note, today there were shares available to be loaned, and right before his stream, there was a massive short attack and then VIOLA there were no more shares to borrow. I don't know if this is coordinated with institutions, but the fuckers only worth $5M, he doesn't have the money to do what is going on by himself. **It could easily be algorithms just picking up news** on the wire and inappropriately acting on it.
* Institutional inflows, bulk orders, and dark pools allow the type of wars we're watching (explained below)
* I think there's just general interest in the stock, the added upside is that Citron and Melvin get fucked in the process of us owning a revolutionary gaming company
* Cohen is going to change things, and hopefully he goes on Benzinga tomorrow to give commentary

&#x200B;

**On how the volume is behaving and what is going on likely:**

As far as institutional inflows those and bulk order flows sometimes go together. Also, some dark pools aggregate their orders so what looks like a bunch of 1000, 500, 250, 50, 90, 110 share lots when people are selling are actually a single lot of 2000 etc.

These dark pools are used as back channels for some private funds that have broker access to the street, and help to disguise institutional movements mostly for hedge funds and speculative funds.

By looking at inflow estimate reports (you have to be in the industry to get access to most of this, it comes from extremely expensive research firms that brokers pay, or they have a team in house doing it) along with bulk orders, and trying to match those to the T&S tape ticker, you can start to see perhaps who is moving what.

If someone transacts let's say, 1M shares, and you can attribute it to a single individual somehow (if the pool didn't aggregate their order into another order to mix it into the execution cycle which normally they do to try and hide it) you can get an idea of what the true tradeable float is (if you don't get why, it's because you don't buy a million shares of something to day trade it, those are sitting at home for awhile, a long while).

Those institutions buying those shares will let the price fall, then throw 50-100k of their shares through. You don't just execute a buy or sell of 1M shares @ $40, it's a thousand here, thousand there and the algo tries to get you the best price possible. Often you'll see dips, massive buy spikes, then buy/sell walls go up at price points where their average is to try and build a retail base also. Considering originally there was a low percentage of outstanding shares traded per day, building that base will take time because institutional ownership is so huge. Once that is built, they just have to counter act any shorts, and see even 50 basis point increase in volume could set this entire thing off.

Those short attacks will stop once the shorts get out of their position but the base will remain and the hunger for the shares will remain. If the short float falls a bit, it actually will help us believe it or not, because the people that are going to get fucked here aren't the institutional traders - it's the big retail whales and 9 figure individuals betting against this. The big firms are already hedged, I promise you.

With the short volume being met by institutional buying volume, I estimate the actual float to be much, much, much smaller than the numbers we're seeing. Institutional ownership is over 100% -- this is ONLY possible by buying synthetic shares that are shorted.

All of this combined shows me that we have firms going at each other. A couple retail whales come in and upset that balance of power, and we're going to see this thing rip upwards. What you're likely seeing is firms day trading calls on swings (yes, calls, not puts) and forcing those swings to help them profit some, then cover some of their shares and slowly reduce the delta of their positions. They're not trading puts because that just exaggerates their delta, they trade the calls in case the thing fucking flies to the moon, their losses are capped as it sits now, and they're likely trading portions of their share position. 10% at a time, and if they have enough capital, they can drag this fight out for a long fucking time. There's no benefit for them to unwind all at once, it could set this thing into the stratosphere. It's potentially possible many of them have various dated $20 calls to help cover their short (and by possible, I mean likely, because the algos probably hedged as soon as it saw the price/volume explode when it moved off the $20 mark and identified the possible buttfucking their short position was about to give them) and they're just slamming volume around trying to create volatility because that's the best for the people writing the options (them and their friends). For all we know, some of these shorts are completely hedged just building it up to profit off the squeeze. If the shares rip up once they get out of the position, they don't care, because they'll hold to expiration for hedge, exercise, take the gains, and tank the stock again and short it on the way down while hedging the upside again. If the stock goes down, they can dump the calls and just let their short ride back down a ways. The calls are their cap -- similar to people buying a debit spread instead of long calls.

But with Melvin's puts likely expired and not re-upped in any identifiable way, that means we know one guy is really under the heat and already way fucking down on his position, which causes desperation. Humans can only take so much. Match that up with Citron's extreme fucking failures over the course of the last two years, we got a couple guys with reputations and millions on the line.

&#x200B;

* **When is the short squeeze going to happen?**

I have no idea when. Whenever the institutions are happy with their positions, probably.

Days to cover means shit, for every person that covers, at this point, someone else is going to take their spot because enough firms think that it's going down and they would love that because they want a better entry on the long term. Believe it or not, regardless of Credit Suisse's way off price target, there's numerous VC firms and big whales looking at this right now wondering if WSB got something right, and if they understand the industry better. Most these guys don't understand gaming, it's a new, growing industry.

The catch is that someone has to be the first one to jump, like cliff diving into water you don't know the depth of. If one firm jumps, others may join. But if they jump and are wrong, they're tied into that investment and can't be non-directional if they're making an investment based play since that would be bad to suppress price for the company they're invested in and a violation of fiduciary responsibility.

This is part of the reason that long term, we could benefit from a pullback. Let some of the assholes off the hook so the real price can be determined by the market.

* **Meta: How do I learn to be good at trading?**

Learn the market first, learn how to trade without any of the finance knowledge. This knowledge really doesn't help me trade all that much, it helps me understand why I win or lose, but knowing how to pick entries/exits and how to control my emotions is the best thing I've learned although I'm unhinged on Melvin and Citron

How I Made $2M In The Stock Market by Nicholas Darvas, then review Bill O Neill's shit with a grain of salt, don't follow CANSLIM to the T, but some of the ideas are sound like how to identify growth companies.

After that, mess around trading shares and just make a goal to profit. If you're down, analyze the position and thesis and decide if you will get a profitable spot later, if so, learn discipline and hold. If not, cut it loose and start another trade.

Do it about 50,000 times over 10,000 hours and you'll get good at it.

&#x200B;

***In Conclusion:*** If you're in the industry, you have access to shit others don't (not implying I am, or how I know these things). You should be able to watch a price/volume chart during the day and instantly identify institutional activity.

Fuck Melvin and Fuck Andrew Left and Shitron. It's one thing to be in a firm and short a stock for fundamental reasons. It's a whole other thing to let your ego get in the way after you drove the price down to $3 and go for the jugular just to make yourself feel better. The guy deserves the fucking $200-$300M loss he's about to eat at the current price, probably more considering the options he had expired and he's likely got some other hedges in place that won't work out for him.

This isn't to flex knowledge, it's to tell people you should be careful just spreading info around this board and getting people on board with a thesis. We're all mostly right on the idea that there's a squeeze coming, but it isn't for the reasons that we're saying.

&#x200B;

* too much publicity

WSB was originally a small community of autists wanting to make big gains with smart plays. Today WSB is more like an open discussion board, that's all over the news, and everyone can join and try to make some gains.  It's good to have a decent amount of players here but let's keep the information to ourselves and off the newspapers and CNBC. There is only a limited amount of gains to be made, let's keep the gains to ourselves and the boomers away. Also, what was the point of expanding to Twitter?

* too many new wannabe autists

WSB is on the frontpage of reddit like every other day with memes, and it attracts a lot of new members. Those new members aren't true autists and they clearly have hard time adjusting to our culture. This has caused attacking certain parties that we don't agree with, pump and dump schemes, lots of stupid posts and upvoting them, that nobody would have upvoted 6 months ago and so on. In general this is much more like a meme subreddit now, even when we are approaching the most important earnings week of the year. A good portion of the new members don't even understand the last sentence.

* this isn't WallStreetMemes, this is WallStreetBets

Anyone who's been here longer than 3 months, knows that we used to have much more useful posts or gain/loss porn in the frontpage of WSB, now it's mainly memes. It's fine to have memes here and there but most of them are just low quality karma farming memes and they get old real fast, unlike loss porn. I bet anyone who has been here longer than a year, would like to see people tattooing stupid shit, drinking piss, GUH their wife's boyfriend's savings away, and just see people act like the true autist they are, rather than these boring new memes.

&#x200B;

**How to fix this?**

1. We had the rule for not allowing posts to be in r/all for like a whole 10 minutes back in the days, and I think we need that back. If someone is a true autist, they will find their way here regardless.
2. Keep the WSB inside the WSB. No Twitter, no news, no sucking Cramer's dick to get to CNBC. We already have enough autists here to be a big player in financial markets. We don't need SEC to do us what your wife's boyfriend does to your wife.
3. GME to the moon
4. WSB needs to be kept under control. True autist never attacks anyone, we just troll people, make tendies and jerk to loss porn. It's pretty simple and if you can't accept it and follow the rules, you deserve to get banned.
5. Let the new members become true autists, absorb our original culture, and I think WSB can be like it used to be. But if we constantly have a lot of new wannabe autists coming in, they are gonna take this sub over and there's nothing we can do.

QNX is a very good RTOS, stable and reliable. However the biggest problem for BB to turn QNX into revenue is that the QNX is really at the very bottom of the systems, there is no way that they could charge it like SaaS. Can you imagine you have a car, if you don‚Äôt renew the system, you won‚Äôt be able to drive it? That‚Äôs a joke right? The only way BB can charge the car manufacturers is one time royalty per car, however it‚Äôs very hard for BB to increase the price, because there is another option that car manufacturers could use, the Automotive Grade Linux. Tesla and Li Auto‚Äôs systems are based on AGL, although some people argue that AGL is not as safe as QNX, Tesla is really a good showcase that QNX is definitely not the only option. Toyota is also moving away from QNX for some of their models starting from 2017. The management of BB realized this problem, they are really concerned and proposed the concept of IVY, but really it‚Äôs just a concept, Amazon wants to use it to expand their AWS business, but there is definitely big uncertainty here, as there are a lot of ways to store the driving data, it would be interesting to see the product of IVY on real car.|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001759.csv|StockTicker|['QNX']|[]|['BB', 'I', 'QNX', 'QNX', 'RTOS', 'BB', 'QNX', 'QNX', 'S', 'BB', 'BB', 'AGL', 'AGL', 'QNX', 'QNX', 'QNX', 'BB', 'IVY', 'AWS', 'IVY']|[]

&#x200B;

Just wanted to update this mornings trading so far made new highs (during NYSE on-hours) on low volume relative to previous volumes.

&#x200B;

I can't see off market volume in relation to open hours charts. Take that into consideration.

&#x200B;

TLDR = Relatively low interest at highs = no ceiling yet for rockets

&#x200B;

Please tell me if this is annoying or if this is interesting. I'm doing it for myself anyway and will stop posting if no interest.

&#x200B;

Some significant volume at what COULD be a high. Volume the highest over the last 3 days of trading, but not exactly climactic in terms of the last two weeks of trading.

&#x200B;

If this is indeed a high, I would expect a retracement and then look for buying interest to come back in, hopefully.

UPDATE 12:20 PM

This is what significant volume looks like. 

However, as I am typing this price just broke this high volume candle.

Volume coming in but overwhelming demand it looks like steamrolling. Some big dick boomer just hit buy because his son on wsb convinced him.

By concentrating enough WSB autism in one point in the form of $60 call options, you created a previously unproven distortion of the fabric of vol/price/time known as a Degenerity, where vol became price, green became red (for dealers) red became green (for option holders), bears like me get excited for bulls, and the market broke, spawning a wormhole to a new universe where GME is somehow above it's ATH, and spraying out a massive field distortion via degenerons, which are now being detected on CNBC.  It's like a black hole, but with options. I look forward to those with PhDs in physics and finance expanding upon this theory. Expect additional unforseen repercussions such as*** r/investing ***advocating a 10% allocation to ""YOLO"" in their now 4 fund portfolio (domestic stocks, global stocks, bonds, YOLO).***

**TLDR: I think Market Makers got completely screwed today by this sub's unprecedented call buying yesterday. Expect some people to get fired. They normally can hedge their calls they sold you buying stock as price moves, but there wasn't supply for them to buy the 15m shares they needed in the 3 hour period this AM, and realy, a good 8-10m of that need happened in a few minute period which was when the market broke. I suspect MM's are going to be in the hole $100-200 million today. And yeah, some people are getting fired. You guys did it - you made the Degenerity! GME hit an all time high price (but not all time high market cap)**

&#x200B;

**Not a short squeeze:**

I don't think this is a short squeeze primarily. I think we are actually seeing a gamma squeeze in which dealers could not hedge as quickly as their short calls lost value, and citadel and other market makers are losing hundreds of millions today as a group, which almost never happens, especially at this scale.

Shorts don't HAVE to cover until there are 0 shares to borrow and they get bought in. They may get margin called before, but institutions diversify. And there are shares to borrow to an extent, rate still 22% on IB. I'm sure some of this happened, but you can't really force this until the many hundreds on a typical hedge fund book.

On the other hand, looking at options, OI went up a lot overnight - I sadly did not check this AM. You now have 80K calls expiring today at 55 to 60 bucks, then another 70k next week, and another maybe 50k at longer dates. That is what we call...  üöÄ ‚õΩ

That's 200k, or 20m shares!!! To hedge that at 63+ you need... about 20m shares.  Of course, some are thetagang short options, so call it 15m shares. Keep in mind, dealers had 25-30m shares before this going into today, so they now want to hold 40-45m shares (on 110m sythethic float of loaned shares + real shares) üöÄ ‚õΩ üöÄ ‚õΩ üöÄ ‚õΩ

When the ramp started around 55, dealers had to rush to buy shares, but could not get 15m shares between $50 and $60.  When it hit $60, there was a HUGE amount of options all at once, and market liquidity was insufficient (""The Degenerity""). At the writing of this post in the morning during the halt, it means they are losing $10m per dollar move in the price, and will pay any price to stop the bleeding. I'm sure some guys in their risk mgmt department are getting fired over this, as the writing was on the wall, and they still sold you guys calls - they should've been charging $10 a call yesterday to protect themselves, or offering much higher strikes to tempt money into that and away from over-concentrating at $60. I suspect when the dust settles, we will find out that the better market makers BOUGHT calls from other market makers, and would not be surprised if there's an 8-k from a market maker tonight about exceptional losses. You may actually bankrupt a small one. Because the mass of calls at $60 got so heavy, it became impossible to hedge in real time.

In terms of gamma conditions from here, there's no remaining real ramp once you are at around 63.

**Edit #3: Previously said we would see stagnation right under $60 because dealers have an interest in a $60 close and probably own 40m+ shares at this point offsetting the huge short calls - and had to unload 6m shares in ITM calls ending today. But it looks like they either don't care or are losing control with this hot close at $64.75. Going to be a lot of share delivery into Monday, maybe as much as 10m.  That'll be interesting to sort out.**

**I'm a bear, but seriously, congrats bulls, you did break the market, but maybe not in the way you think you did. I really think the guys you screwed today were MMs, probably on the order of $100-200m... I have profound respect for what you did. Yes, my puts sucked, I'm down $35k all together on trying to play this one. You are welcome, you deserve it.**  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

And I'm really dumb for not checking open interest this morning. Writing was on the wall due to all the calls you guys bought yesterday. It's infuriating when you know you could've seen it in plain sight and were too busy doing something else to check.

I do think MMs will be more careful on this moving forward and make this less likely to repeat. This epic failure on their part is going to attract CIO level oversight. Unlike the meltup last Wednesday where they got to hedge smoothly, they were not able to hedge here.

Also, wanted to link you guys Martin Shkreli's comments on the GME situation from YESTERDAY via people who have access to him I guess by phone (since he still has about a year of federal prison left)? Very interesting. Looking forward to his read as someone who's squeezed someone before:

Looking to open up a discussion thread about today's GME Short Data. I'm attaching an image from ORTEX after today's beautiful share price action. You bet that GME will be making news rounds all over the world after today, over the weekend. We're only getting started. If any of you have read my MOASS price target post from around a week or so ago\*\*, you would know that I kept on hammering the term 'zero point' over and over. It just means it's the starting point (whether it's your portfolio value, or the share price, or both) prior to a face-ripping MOASS. Well, if you've held on to GME the entire time since that post, congratulations. Your zero point has just grown a substantial amount, **especially** after today's close @ +51.08% (as per Yahoo! Finance GME closing price). GME today even touched \~+-80% intra-day @ $76.76, breaking the previous Share Price ALL-TIME-HIGH of $63.77 (dated Dec. 7, 2008) from ***\~13 years ago*** (data gathered using TD-ToS trading platform), *and then, closing at the new share price ALL-TIME-HIGH closing price @* $65.01 (as per Y! Finance GME). It's some fucking tendie-town shit.

All the mathematical power and beauty of consecutive-day compounding interest is now to GME LONGS' advantage. The inverse is true for shorts: they're getting seriously fucked by many things; face-ripping, ass-gaping, wife-fucking compounding interest only one among them. (Also, RIP to Citron Research AKA. Andrew ""Left for Dead"" Shitron.) Yeah, you read that shit right: SHORTS are about to get inflicted with MAXIMUM MATHEMATICAL PAIN. It sounds nerdy af I know, but ain't that the truth.

I don't claim to be an expert on GME short metrics & data, and so I leave it to the experts to hopefully analyze what I'm attaching here, hence a discussion thread. *AKA. WHAT DO THESE CRAYONS ON THE SCREEN MEAN, DADDY?*

However: based off off what I see on the data attached, I have come to believe that shorts have started to unwind their positions, albeit ***only slightly***, relative to the entire short position. (I could be wrong, and if so, let me know in the comments. Let's discuss.) Still, as the data presents below, it seems that the SHARES SHORTED still stands at a HISTORIC >100%, at 102.29%. *Goddamn. My asscheeks just clenched a little writing and thinking about all the trapped shorts (RIP). What an absolutely titanic and colossal failure of risk management.* Can't complain though lmao. *Tendies all day, everyday, bitch!*

Again remember, on WSB, we take into account TRADEABLE % of FLOAT, where, according to some DDs posted in the sub, is estimated to be running at around 200%+, due to (we, at the very least, assume) '*fixed'* massive institutional and insider ownership, that cannot/will not/*might not* sell, *all while* the shorts are fucking drowning and thrashing around, desperate to get some breathable air--in the middle of the goddamn *Atlantic Ocean* with no boats nor ships in sight. It's like *Titanic*, but they're Jack, and you're *the sexy-ass rich bitch* named Rose. Only one survives. *(Spoiler alert: It ain't Jack.)*

All said, I think we have a ways to go before all the shorts are fully covered (*we're talking potential MULTIPLES of current price, and, ergo, your DADDY-AS-FUCK GME PORTFOLIO)* e.g. more tendies to come. Focus, get ready, and have a plan. This could be *THE* trade of your lifetime.

Rod is--among many titles--the Prime Author of the GME DD website, accessible to anyone curious about GME-GameStop Valuation Targets : [$GME DD](https://www.gmedd.com/) ) He was live on BENZINGA this morning, giving a NON-RETARDED & INTELLIGENT REPRESENTATION of GME LONGS and Retail Investors alike ([$GME With Rod Alzmann & CJ Trades | ZingerNation Power Hour - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLzTU87MJMM), starts at around 18:39); and I watched as the MARKET FUCKING RIPPED THE SHORTS TO SHREDS (EVEN INFLICTING MULTIPLE TRADING HALTS) WHILE HE WAS BEING INTERVIEWED LMAO. Even the Benzinga hosts couldn't fucking believe it themselves. Appreciate the good work, brother. Fucking cheers!! Maybe Ryan Cohen next? üòé

**Positions**: 100% GME. Diversified at 2/3 in Shares, 1/3 in April calls, and I rode these fuckers to war even during and after the **Q3ER** share price crash, due to paper hands and heavy short-seller action. **#WeRemember** and **#WeWillNeverForget.** **NOW, it's time for the Shorts to pay lmao.** (Current Value in $ : *more than tree fiddy,* and *more than enough* *to finance* Andrew ""Left for dead"" Citron's onlyfans as a tax-deductible charity expense.)

edit 4: added an important comment, thanks to u/otto989.

>u/otto989: *Hold up it says Thursday, Jan 21 at the bottom right of the chart. I'm as curious as all of you about SI after today but want to make sure these numbers are right.*

>u/fieryskyes: *Hey man, good catch! Actually, the numbers CHANGED while posting this entire thing, RIGHT AFTER today's close. I literally had to re-type the data. The graph, I will agree, however shows Thursday 21st. Not sure what to make of that exactly. We will keep updating on this for sure. But from what I remember, the ""%FREEFLOAT ON LOAN"" data changed from 98.68% to 102.29% (as it stands now). Good comment. I will include this in the post itself.""*

Yea, the ""%Free float on loan"" actually increased by \~3.5% while I was posting/writing this, as the CLOSING BELL struck (I use TD Ameritrade's Thinkorswim platform like a real trading daddy should, and it rings the bell at close 4PM EST SHARP. So ya I fucking remember that moment like a Pavlovian bitch.) It *could* mean that the ORTEX data reflected up-to-date data then. Fucking coincidence, amirite? Regardless, WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO before all short positions are covered, if they even have started to cover today in the first place. So chill, daddy, it's all under control and shit. Sit back, relax, and continue to jerk off to your KINGLY GME gains.

Don't worry my brothers, I will keep on watching ORTEX data, even on Monday. We will track this bitch in every possible way. *Shorts will not get out alive.* Also, you can get ORTEX data yourself, with a free 7-day trial period. Not affiliated with them in any way. Just consider it if you want the raw data for yourself.

Emerging addict here. Let me tell you why I think today‚Äôs closing price is a sign that GME is yet to rocket!

Why do you think the spike dropped to $60 and stayed there the rest of the day? Because the fuckton of $60 option calls that just expired. /u/PlayFree_Bird explained it well [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2txra/that_was_a_margin_call/gk87z17/). Today wasn‚Äôt a margin call, it was a gamma squeeze. The four-hour war at $60 is huge evidence of this. Basically, as the stock price increased, call writers realized they might have to provide stocks for the $60c option owners. Greedy bastards didn‚Äôt want to payout. What do they likely do instead? Fucking borrow more GME and short-sell the shit out of it to drop it below $60 and keep it there the rest of the day. If they succeed, they don‚Äôt have to provide shit on the butt-ton of 1/22 $60c options. If it closes above $60, they get fucked. For four hours today, every time the stock jumped above $60, call writers bought MORE SHORTS to drop the price back under $60.

Again, today wasn‚Äôt MM dumping shorts, it was options contracts buying MORE shorts attempting to save their ass (at least that's what my dumb ass thinks). But guess what? The stock closed at $64.75! Fuck! They lost!

So **why does this mean GME üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ in the future**?

1) This wasn‚Äôt the short squeeze, old shorts are likely still there bleeding fuck and filling the rocket with fuel.

2) Short holdings probably INCREASED today because the gamma squeeze above. More rocket fuel.

3) They lost the fucking bet on number 2, and have to fulfill the calls that expired today. More rocket pressure.

Notice: Aftermarket is up to $68. No more panic-pressure to keep it down.

It seems to me that GME is actually in a better position to rocket AFTER today, not worse. To the moon you retards! üöÄüåö

I don't know about you but, for me, it's more fun to **guh** *WITH* the retard than *BE* the retard who lost their tax money YOLOing on FDs.

According to this sub there are three things going for $BB that cause it to be undervalued:

- Cylance Acquisition 

- Blackberry IVY partnership with AWS

- QNX 

## Cylance: I'll start with the one I don't know shit about 

This is a crowded space (anti virus). That's all I have to say about that.

## Blackberry IVY partnership with AWS:

AWS is fighting hard to get market share in the edge computing space. Perfect example of this is AWS Greengrass and IoT core.

What is [AWS Greengrass](https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/)? It's IoT device management. AWS is going to do the device lifecycle management for QNX deployments on vehicles. (speculation) Essentially, this looks to be AWS Greengrass integrated with BB QNX.  

Why does AWS want to partner with BB QNX? Well to me, this looks to be a classic extend embrace extinguish play by Amazon. AWS has products such as IoT core that can manage telematics flow between OEMs and vehicles, what they don't have is products for in vehicle development. Once they understand the market, they will introduce AWS products along side IoT core to replace QNX piece by piece in the vehicles. 

## QNX

Ok WSB. Y'all keep saying that QNX will take $BB to the moon because all these upstart EV nobodies are using QNX to bootstrap their infotainment systems. 

Enter automotive linux: https://www.automotivelinux.org/

Automotive linux is a partnership with a TON of traditional OEMS to build an open source software (linux) stack for vehicles such as infotainment, edge compute and telematics. 

This is effectively the nail in the coffin (IMO) for QNX. If these EV upstarts gain marketshare, they have no reason to continue paying $BB for a closed source, price-y QNX. They'll migrate to automotive linux for F R E E. No more niche QNX developers, get a generic dev with some linux info and they'll be up to speed in no time. 

If QNX dies, so does the IVY partnership. In fact, since AGL linux based and open source, no doubt Amazon will make amazing AWS client libraries to integrate with Greengrass, IoT Core, etc. Once Amazon gets its fingers into AGL, IVY is dead in the water.


So where does this leave us? Cylance. In my know nothing option $BB's only asset is Cylance in a highly competitive space. Once virus protection entities get big enough, hackers start developing FUD (fully undetectable) solutions to the most popular virus protection software. Back in their day you think McAfee or Norton was shit? No. They became popular and had hackers develop against their software.

----

GL WSB on $BB. I hope you succeed. I have no position on $BB. I'm all in $GME üöÄ

Here's the fun part - while I never thought I'd make this much on the trade, when I entered it I promised my Maker I'd give 20% of whatever gains I had to charity and folks affected by the pandemic. I thought maybe it would be $10k or maybe $20k - who knows, $50k if shit got wild. 

So far, post taxes it's around $150k. Wow. We researched charities in our area and I found one that focuses on preventing evictions and helping kids in crisis. We called them this week to tell them what we plan to drop by next week and they were shocked. It costs a lot less to keep a family in their current home than to find them a new one, and in a lot of places, the average eviction is over less than a thousand bucks. They estimate this will keep 100 families in their homes - the majority of whom have kids under 5.

l2zk5e||A hedge fund managers perspective on GME|t3_l2zk5e|0.97|8690|8690|top|2021-01-23 02:09:53.000000|Robertf1032010|1323|Discussion|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/|"I am a hedge fund manager (long-short, derivative mixed equity fund primarily value focused with some growth). In the past we have been value holders of GME three other times and started a small position today nears it's intraday high and will likely add to this next week should the stock fall.   Previously all my Reddit comments have involved my e-Skate collection or my landing of my airplane in challenging conditions (see: [https://youtu.be/Rn7XoYKlZl0](https://youtu.be/Rn7XoYKlZl0)) However, I can't resist commenting on the fascinating technical factors that likely will continue to propel this issue higher - perhaps significantly so over the next few weeks.  Andrew Left's mocking derision of retail investors may prove to be his waterloo.  Why would a value focused fund manager buy a stock that based on classic fundamental value analysis appears significantly overvalued?  

GME appears to be a very interesting example of individual stock reflexivity.  What is reflexivity you ask?  This is the theory, originally promoted by George Soros that the stock market itself can cause the economy to either rise of fall (as opposed to the classic teaching that the economy affects the stock market).  An example of market reflexivity would be the great depression whereby a crashed market brought down an economy that was only in an ordinary recession, or the recent improvement in the economy, not withstanding Covid, which has followed a rising market.  In GME's case the rise in the stock price itself will likely result in fundamental improvements to the underlying economic metrics of the company.  Why?

1. As the price of the stock rises, GME finds itself in the enviable position where it can use it's stock at currency to buy complementary businesses it could not otherwise afford - monetization of the current short squeeze by the enterprise will lead to fundamentally higher revenue and profits of the enterprise should they find good strategic acquisitions to further monetize their large retail customer base (which has real and to date largely untapped value).  The company is likely right now on the hunt for a major acquisition that could fundamentally alter the companies future prospects with that acquisition largely paid for on the back of short seller covering.
2. Monetization of the short covering increase in share price via issue of a secondary .   The $500 million in debt (net of cash) the company currently has could be entirely extinguished with a secondary that is dilutive of only 10% of the equity base.  In fact such a secondary will, despite this dilution, likely result in a significant price rise for the stock (versus the usual fall in price after most, but not all, secondaries).  Bankruptcy risk will largely be eliminated with this secondary as will interest rate risk and financing costs ultimately increasing cash flow per share.  A 20% secondary will leave the company in a strong cash positive position with this cash available for expansion of sales efforts, cloud offerings, acquisitions, etc.
3. Directly increased sales and revenue by virtue of the large amount of attention this epic short squeeze has brought to the company.  I suspect most long retail stockholders have explored the companies web offerings and are considering becoming customers.  This is free advertising to people with money who are tech savvy and the exact demographic GME would target with paid advertising.  
4. Retention and efforts of existing management now becomes easy.  Every manager there wants to see this continue.  Operations at companies with sinking share prices typically suffer as management and employees leave the enterprise or develop anger and lassitude (think Sears Holdings).   The opposite is occurring here with every manager trying to beat their numbers to see the squeeze continue.
5. This issue remains extremely heavily shorted.  Despite the squeeze that has already occurred, other ""value"" based investors have dived into short positions as the price has risen.  The short positions of this issue appears (although I can't be certain) to exceed 100% with all available shares already lent out from marginal accounts and probably a lot of naked shorting going on as well.  Although I don't yet have the current data on todays short position, I can say for certain the stock remains very heavily shorter, perhaps more so now than at any previous time.  Today, I called my broker asking about the availability of shares to short and the borrow costs.  We have one of the larger accounts at our brokers firm and I was able to speak directly to the ""hard to borrow"" desk.  No borrowable shares are available at any broker, anywhere, at this time, even for high borrow costs or even from other brokers.  This extreme short against a small common float, made more extreme no-doubt by naked shorting, could end very poorly for those short this issue.  As they are forced to close out their positions, the stock will continue to rise and continue to exacerbate the positive effects the rising price has on the above 4 issues.

Impossible to know really where the stock goes from here as there does currently exist a disconnect from fundamentals. However, the extreme short position against the unrestricted common float here suggests to me there is a much greater chance of GME's price continuing to increase, perhaps significantly so, and this chance is far greater than the now fearful pundit in hiding's proclamation that the stock would soon see $20.

For what it's worth, over the past 13 years of this funds life, we have significantly beaten both the overall market and the dow,  (12.2%/year margin over DJIA inclusive of dividends since 2008).  We  have had plenty of losing issues despite this beat but also way more big winners, some really big.  Right now my money's with the retail investors who are long GME.  We only have a small position here but this may prove a big winner for us also.

Jokes aside, this $3 billion market cap \[edit: now 6B\] had $300m in cash flow at peak. I don't care that the stock has gone from 4 to 40--I'm interested in where it goes from here. A turnaround (can you call it that? a return to normal...) could bring cash flows to their old peak, but I suspect the continuing demise of retail and other headwinds probably make peak achievable cash flow closer to $200m. So, you're paying 15x for a turnaround/return that hasn't happened yet. That's not outrageously expensive, but it's not for me. Plenty of cheaper stocks out there.

¬†¬†One more thing--trying to game short-selling--a bit of a metamarket approach--rarely works in my experience. I've seen all kinds of ""squeezes"" like \[CENSORED TICKER\], Volkswagen/Porsche, etc. While there are functional market mechanics that are worth knowing and watching, trying to 'battle' in the marketplace doesn't make sense. Look at HLF, etc. At the end of the day, the value of the company will be what matters, which is generally a function of the cash flow of the company. There are other dynamics, of course, that's what makes a good trader a good trader. I'd rather ignore that stuff and be a decent investor, since I think there is limited causal reasoning in the former. Intuition rules the trader, and we're in a very non-intuitive environment.¬†

¬†¬†Anyway, I think GME is more of a long at $20 and more of a short at $60-80. No need to get upset about one's opinion. I have been around Internet message boards on stocks since they began, and geez, people get emotional, way more than r/wsb. I have really ticked people off my entire life on stock message boards (and come to think of it... everywhere else) pointing out the obvious. See some old posts of mine on \[CENSORED TICKER\], CYTX, ONTY, NFLD and many more. All of those stocks disappeared with failure. GME is a real company with valueable assets. It's not a short from what I can tell. But that's just my opinion!"|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001805.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'I', 'SORED', 'HLF', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'SORED', 'CYTX', 'ONTY', 'NFLD', 'GME', 'I']|['GME', 'HLF', 'GME', 'CYTX', 'ONTY', 'GME']

While we are all extremely excited that a lot of people are making money these days, and right now you can almost throw a dart at a dartboard and land on something that will  üöÄ, if you do not know what you are doing, you are playing a HIGH RISK GAME AND YOU WILL LOSE MONEY.  AND POTENTIALLY LOTS OF MONEY.  MAYBE ALL OF IT.  It's happened throughout history, over and over again.

The folks that play this game and consistently make a ton of money at it are very good at what they do.  They have a lifetime of experience, understanding, and tools at their disposal that we do not have.  I am a finance major, a business owner, and over 15 years in basic investing, and I still get walloped from time to time.  I've got nothing on those guys, or the brilliant minds on this thread.

Please make sure you are messing around with money you can afford to lose.  Yes, I am in BB, GME, and a bunch of others, but I'm playing around with money that won't hurt me if I lose.

Some of the folks on here are putting up their rent money, college money, life savings, and grandma's disability check on BETS without understanding how much risk they are actually taking.  While we all want Melvin to suffer, look out for your fellow man.  There's nothing wrong with owning SOME index funds, and the ones I own are making money as well.

EDIT 2:  WOW!  I did not expect this to get a lot of attention.  I'm glad that a few people took note and for everyone else looking out, that's one of the reasons I like this sub!  I want to reiterate - if you understand the above, if you understand the roaring 20s and the Great Depression, and you accept the risks with your YOLO, that's fine!  This is for the ever growing crowd that thinks 10-15% gains is NORMAL, and that they can leverage themselves to the teeth to become the next DFV overnight.  These people clearly DO NOT understand the risks, and therefore deserve a quick heads up.

I've received some messages asking where to start.  That's great.  Here's what I would suggest:

Youtube and Google are your friends.  Anything you read that you don't understand (Calls, puts, shorts, float, squeeze - Google IT).  Start with WHAT A SHARE OF STOCK ACTUALLY REPRESENTS, and that you are paying a price for a small percentage of ownership in that company and its current (or potential/eventual) profits.  Start with BASIC company valuation - learn about market cap, PE ratios, P/S ratios.  Learn how to read an income statement and balance sheet.  Make sure companies have a path to profitability if they are not making money.  With this knowledge, you can start to understand for yourself if a company is potentially over or undervalued.  Start with what companies you know and understand what they are selling, along with trends that you know and understand. When you start getting into stuff that you don't understand or see the vision for, you're just along for the ride.  Trial by fire and just getting into it is fine (I learn constantly from my own mistakes and practice makes perfect), but make it a very small percent of what you have. Buy partial shares. Also, realize you will need to probably buy and hold many stocks...it won't just happen overnight. Recent MEME stocks are an exception. When that happens, awesome. But it's rarely like that.  GL and have fun with it too.

If you think BB moon‚Äôd after this week, you‚Äôre a rough brained retard. Our astronauts John Chen and Tom Eacobacci are literally in the break room; Chen‚Äôs unpacking some homemade Yangzouh Fried Rice from his wife, Tom is microwaving stale coffee and asking Chen if he‚Äôs going to change his name to Cha Ching after he becomes a Billionaire in 2023. Chen smirks as he cracks open his wheel of fortune cookie... the point is, rocket is still fucking grounded. I repeat, the rocket is grounded. 

Listen retards, did you miss AMD? Did you miss NVDA? Did you miss trash ass Cringecoin? Hell, did you even miss TSLA? Are you seething with FOMO up to your ears and out of your assholes watching these stocks mint fresh millennial millionaires while you twiddled your thumbs thinking ‚ÄúGeE WiZ tHeY haVe To CoMe DoWn EveNtuAlLYyyyYyyYy‚Äù 

Pro tip: they never came down...

These rockets went to the fucking moon and left your ass behind on planet Earth, living a shitty wage life flipping burgers, while the retards that boarded these rockets are on the moon laying on beach chairs, sunglasses on, and rubbing sunscreen with SPF 9000 on their smooth brains because they got front row tickets to the sun... FRONT ROW TICKETS TO THE FUCKING, SUN... this is the present state of affairs. 

There is, lucky you, however, another rocket with the inscription BBC fueling up and selling tickets to the moon AS WE SPEAK.

Current position: missionary with 10,555 shares and reverse cowgirl with some calls. I‚Äôm holding unrealized profits of about $110k and realized profits of about $100k. 

However, if you ask me 10 years from now my biggest regret in life... I will tell you two things: 1, not getting my wife her bf earlier on, and 2, booking $100k profit too soon in BB. 

May Lord Chen forgive my moment of weakness. Learn from me. Buy and walk away. Buy and hold. Do not be tempted to sell before the moon. Do not sell when the rocket is still in the stratosphere. 

Moon is $50 IF THE STOCK JUST TRADES ON PAR WITH ITS FUCKING PEERS, MOON CAN EASILY BE $100+ IF YOU FACTOR IN VERTICALS, ECONOMIC MOAT, and a $450-750 billion Auto Data Market as stated in Mckinsey and Company‚Äôs report on Monetizing Auto Data. Yes that‚Äôs not a mistake, the overall revenue pool from Global Auto Data monetization could be as high as $750 BILLION in 2030. This is the market BB has cornered and is about to squeeze by the balls. QNX was always the crown Jewel of all their verticals. This was always the master plan for the turnaround. We are on the fucking cusp of one of the greatest turnarounds in history. 

Listen, I don‚Äôt think some of you rough brained retards realize what is happening: 

Ask yourselves: why is the EV sector so hot? Why is every large tech corporation trying to get a piece of this Auto pie? 

You wanna know why? Because when the computer first came out it took up entire fucking floors in a building to do simple calculations... when the cell phone first came out, you needed a fucking brief case just to carry it and you looked like an absolute tool making a phone call, stopping everything you‚Äôre doing, laying down your suitcase, opening it, taking out the brick, extending a massive antenna, LMFAO, what fucking tools boomers were... now look at the modern laptop and smartphone. Look at the revolutions these products went through to become cemented into our lives. Look at the markets these products opened up for us. 

Now, what current item is undergoing this type of revolution? You guessed it, you smooth brained criminal you, the Automobile. What was once dinosaur machinery unironically running on dead dinosaurs, is now making the revolution on the scale that computers and phones went through to become what they are today. 

And guess who created a business moat anticipating this move 10 years in advance? Guess who cemented their ISO SAFETY CERTIFIED AUTO OS into 175 million automobiles as of today, hint hint: it‚Äôs the same company that‚Äôs so criminally undervalued and just took on AWS as their partner to scale up their business for next phase of the turnaround: Revenue Growth. 

Blackberry. It‚Äôs Blackberry. Babe berry. Member berry. The blacker the berry... the sweeter the juice boys. 

‚ÄúwhAt aBoUT GoOgLe aNd APpLe or TSLA TaKiNg OvEr the Auto OS mArKet‚Äù 

Listen retards, BlackBerry‚Äôs MOAT is bullet proof. You know why?

Because what‚Äôs the one thing Google, Apple, and TSLA have in common? They‚Äôre actually in the fucking auto business. 

You think Mercedes or Toyota wants to cede even more profit in the auto business to competitors by adopting their OS and giving them a boost? Do you know how cutthroat and ruthless the corporate world is? As soon as Apple announced they‚Äôre entering Auto, Papa Musk publicly called Tim Cook a pussy on Twitter. That cutthroat. 

Let me demonstrate with the ol‚Äô lemonade stand analogy. Let‚Äôs say you setup a lemonade stand outside your house and all the kids are going nuts for your lemonade. Next thing you know, Jimmy from next door opens a lemonade stand, and throws in a Jolly Rancher inside each lemonade he makes. You‚Äôre fucked. Jimmy just took your business, your friends, your girl and her bf. 

You need to level the playing field by adding Jolly Ranchers to your lemonade... so how will you do this? Are you gonna go up to Jimmy‚Äôs stand and straight up buy Jolly Ranchers from your mortal enemy? Is that what a smooth brained person would do? 

NO, you would walk your ass down the street to a neutral third party convenient store, buy fucking Jolly Ranchers from them, and while you‚Äôre at it, buy some cough syrup and add that as well to your lemonade. Because fuck Jimmy, that‚Äôs why. 

Speaking of lemonade... 

‚ÄúwHat iF ShiTrOn TaKeS a ShIT oN BB?‚Äù

Andrew Left although the gayest bear of them all, actually saw BB potential years ago calling it the next NVDA. He was early on that call, but he was right. 

Back to the lemonade moat: 

Listen retards, Blackberry is not a competitor to any auto maker the same way Apple, Google, and TSLA are. You think auto makers are going to use their competitors OS? Or you think these non tech, legacy hardware automobile dinosaurs like Mercedes and Toyota are gonna reinvent the wheel and create their own OS? Fuck no. BB went from hardware to software after years of pain and turmoil because they had to, and now you think any ol‚Äô dinosaur hardware auto company can easily whip up a software division and create an OS? How thick are you? Don‚Äôt be so rough brained and fall for that gay bear ‚ÄúDD.‚Äù 

QNX is so valuable Apple has been poaching QNX employees for years. Remember tho, even if they successfully create an OS for their car, they are Jimmy, and no auto manufacturer is buying Jolly Ranchers from fucking Jimmy. BB Moat is BULLET PROOF. 

BlackBerry is a neutral third party corporation that ALL auto makers can form a cartel around with Papa Chen as the cartel lord. Think OPEC for cars, and BB as the Saudis. A couple automakers MIGHT create their own OS because they‚Äôre a fucking tech company to begin with, and they have the scale and reach to do so, but don‚Äôt think for A FUCKING SECOND their competitors are gonna just line up to use it and cede more their profits to them. These other Auto OS (if made) will be specific and unique to that companies own car. Think. Use that smooth brain. 

Blackberry has effectively become the gate keeper of the Auto Data Market. 

Also this is a tough fucking market. Cars are one of the most data rich endpoints in the world that need securing. This isn‚Äôt like a laptop, you click the wrong link, and next thing you know you have a million Hentai pop ups. The car is more serious. You click the wrong link; and you‚Äôre dead. 

Are you getting the picture now? Do you see why Cylance was bought? Do you see why BlackBerry‚Äôs moat is so secure? 

Cylance has just been integrated into QNX and was shown off at CES. How many of you missed that fine detail? 

Not only does QNX now act as the gatekeeper of all auto data, it fucking protects the super sensitive endpoints using AI driven cyber protection that gets better and better the more the data grows, which it will, exponentially. 

Automakers are lined up like school boys on Easter Sunday ready for deliverance from Papa Chen as he blesses them with QNX.

Remember when Chen said: ‚Äúwhen better days come, we‚Äôll be ready to execute‚Äù

Better days are here. This is what he was talking about. They‚Äôve positioned and prepared themselves for 10 years to become the Auto Data Gatekeeper once the technology was ready. The foresight on Papa Chen... Absolute Genius.

I am seriously considering throwing my ROTH into this. We‚Äôre talking a LOT of money. I‚Äôm not a whale, god no, but I want to yeet this cash and see if it can double or triple in the next week. 

What GME shorters and my actual retard brother and everyone else is failing to understand is, we certified smooth brains on this sub can see GameStop‚Äôs FUTURE potential. We already knew GameStop was a ‚Äúdying company‚Äù but fuck, we held the goddamn line and now some of you can afford a full meal at Wendy‚Äôs, and not just some fries. GameStop is due for a massive transformation, and we see it. Boomers clearly don‚Äôt, the Gay Lemon did not, but we hold and buy SHARES because we understand that this isn‚Äôt a bet on the past but faith in the future of the company. 

I have been in this army since the price hit $36.00. Now it‚Äôs at $65 or some shit like that, and I KNOW it my heart it has room to üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ to atleast $100 next week. Shit, I feel in my jellies it‚Äôll hit $120-$130 by EOW next week. 

So üíéü§ö bulls, is it time to YEET the Roth IRA all into GME, and if so, when should I buy in to help the cause? I need to see who else is standing and holding, I wanna see REAL AUTISTS rise up and tell me to hold. I believe in it, but do YOU?

Cheers, and good luck fuckers. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Blackberry is not the next GME either, because it doesn't have many shorts. In fact, Andrew Left from Citron is [long](https://citronresearch.com/blackberry-next-nvidia/) on it. So there's no short squeeze coming.

Context

What happened last week with GME stock price and option was a combination of a gamma squeeze \[1\] and infinite short squeeze \[2\]. For the first time in financial history all GME call options are in the money (ITM) because the highest call strike price set by the CBOE for Januaray 29, 2021 is $60. Note:¬†A primer on gamma squeeze: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme\_i\_think\_this\_is\_a\_gamma\_squeeze\_where\_dealers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/) Market Maker \[1\] are in a condition never observed in financial history. Hundred of thousands of retail are buying the GME 60C across the options calendar and MM can't hedge properly because there are not enough GME shares to buy to properly financially hedge (accounting for the interest rate to borrow)

Market Structure

To summarize the market structure:

Few GME shares to hedge.

Hundreds of thousands of are buying the GME 60C because of the infinite short squeeze.

January 29, 2021 60C call option are the highest one on the option change for that date.

Conditions for Infinite Gamma Squeeze & Infinite Short Squeeze

As you may now realize --(MM and brokers) hope you don't -- there is a gap in the market structure that leaves them (MM/Citadel) vulnerable to massive losses. Infinite Gamma Squeeze Should¬†million of retails buy the Januray 29, 2021 60C weekly on Monday, this will create an infinite gamma squeeze because MM still can't properly hedge, and are forced to buy shares at whatever price to hedge. MM doing so, forces brokers to margin call the shorts caught in their infinite short squeeze. Both conditions are pro-cyclical and feed on each other in an infinite feedback loop¬†so long as more an more retails buy the GME 60C. There is a chance that MM can dump the shares they bought to hedged the gamma steepening and call buying \[1\]. However, doing so does not make them market neutral. It effectively turns MM into a hedge fund. SEC may allow them to get away from this momentarily. However, after the MM dump shares in an attempt to stop the infinite gamma squeeze they will be net short GME shares and unhedged/not market neutral.¬†If after the MM dump, retails continue to buy GME shares up to the $60 price, MM will be caught in a¬†exponentially worse gamma squeeze, which should GME go pass 60C (gamma bump) on the week of January 25, it would turn into the one of biggest tail risk event for the MM/Citidal. tldr; There is a gap in the market structure so that if millions of retails buy Januray 29 GME 60C on January 25 2021, there is a high probability of both an infinite gamma and short squeeze. This has never happened in financial history. And should millions of retail buy the January 29 GME60C 2021, the losses for MM but profits for retail will be massive. Retails could see 100000% return on their weekly GME Januray 29 call options at the highest strike price. Edit1:¬†Apparently there may be higher call prices for the January 29 2021 option chains. Fundamentally, this analysis is still correct. Should millions of retail all choose a common higher call strike price to buy (higher than 60C), the gamma squeeze will be triggered when that prices is hit. Example: Should millions of retail buy the January 29 70C or January 29 75C, and the infinite short squeeze continues. If the GME 70C or 75C is hit, GME share price enters a gamma squeeze. What the MM are hoping for are twofolds:

They scare retails to sell below $60. This alleviates the infinite gamma squeeze. Or;

Retails don't all buy the same call options. But given that retail loves high risk, I hypothesize they will all choose the furthest OTM call options.

GME at 60 is the Maginot line next week. Should it go to 75, gamma and infinite short squeeze continues. Should it fall below it, MM have won a strategic victory. Edit2: For gamma squeeze, you look at the open interest (OI) and strike price. Should the share price get close to the price with a highest open interest, that's when the gamma steepening occurs as probability goes to 1. MM have to buy shares to remain neutral as the options are now ITM.

Edit 2. I know it's probably to late since this was posted but I cannot help all the actual retards in the comments and messaging me. If you do not know what 1/29 75c means, just buy shares. If you're a faggoty european, please don't ask how to trade options in your country, just buy shares. Buying GME calls is probably not for first timers. If you want to be extra retarded, Sell ITM puts and use the cash to buy OTM calls. This is not sound financial practice nor is any of this post actual advice.

This is just my retarded brain trying to think through this idea. I‚Äôm also not the first to propose this idea. Just remember I can‚Äôt read so I didn‚Äôt see those other posts. 

For those that have made mountains of sweet, sweet tendies from the GME üöÄüöÄ, I am wondering if the income tax increase that many of us will realize this year can be reduced by also helping our Tendiemaker directly. This is more specific to Itemized tax filers. If you file Standard, this will only benefit up to $300, which would still be a big deal if tons of us did this up to $300. Itemized filers can deduct up to 60% of their AGI.

Edit: it was brought up that the $300 deduction only applies if the cash donation is given directly to the charity. I‚Äôm not verifying it, but it sounds plausible enough.

Edit 2: As u/whitemarshian points out, a better alternative to this strategy could be to donate the shares directly to a donor advised fund. I had not considered this strategy, but this also sounds like good shit. Maybe someone could expand upon this thought and put together another post exploring this?

SUPER EDIT: As u/MichaelVicksPitbull points out, buying gift cards will show up on the balance sheet as Unearned Revenue. This increase in liabilities would be offset by the increase in cash from purchasing the gift cards, so there isn‚Äôt really a net advantage for GME‚Äôs financials until the gift card is redeemed. This would be an unlikely benefit for Q4.

So here it is. Everyone fortunate enough to be aboard this moon shot heads over to their local GME before 1/31, and we collectively buy what amounts to hopefully millions of dollars in GME gift cards. We take those gift cards and donate them to The Ronald McDonald House or a local Children‚Äôs Hospital (St. Jude‚Äôs is well known, but I would suggest keeping your donations local to help your community) for them to buy electronics for their patients and patient families. My wife works for a Children‚Äôs Hospital, and there are many ‚Äúentertainment areas‚Äù packed with electronics throughout the hospital where sick children get a chance to escape the fight and reality of being sick. This is also an extraordinary relief for young family members of patients and parents as they can be occupied while their sibling or child undergoes tests or procedures or whatever.

We would be giving revenue a huge shot in the arm whenever the gift cards are redeemed, give GME tons of cash to end Q4, and by donating the gift cards to local charities you can reduce the tax burden on your gainz. This will also be a way for us to change the narrative and show those currently besmirching the name of WSB that we aren‚Äôt an army, we aren‚Äôt some nefarious insider trading collective, nor are we the thieves we are being painted out to be. We‚Äôre just a bunch of smooth brains trying to make money or lose it all for the sake of sweet sweet internet points.

Doing this would also not only give you üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ in your heart, but bless you with more üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ when GME hits $1,000.

If my true retardation is missing any of the key points, please let me know where I am misinterpreting the tax code and I will gladly amend this post.

Position: 1,450 stonks, 4/16 $30c and 7/16 $35c

More obligatory rockets: üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

TL:DR: Buy GME gift cards, donate them to The Ronald McDonald House or a local Children‚Äôs Hospital. Help sick children and their families. Reduce tax burden. Increase WSB love.

It **ripped face** from $43 up to $75 in the morning session. That was fucking wild, even for this autist's dream of a stock. 

Others have already commented on why this has happened, but I'll summarize for the dunces in the back. In short, the market makers wrote a **LOT** of OTM calls last week, and then had to buy shares to cover when those calls went ITM around noon. This is what caused the absurd spike from $50 to $75 in just an hour and a half. That's the **gamma squeeze** that everyone has been talking about, where MM's couldn't cover fast enough.

The rest is history, GME closed at $65, and every single call that expired yesterday was ITM. That's fucking retarded. 

What this means, though, is that the MM's/brokers are going to have to deliver a ridiculous amount of shares when these expired options settle. Typically, settlement is on Tuesdays. I've read estimates that 10-15M shares worth of calls expires ITM last Friday. Again, this is fucking retarded. 

Please note that **none** of the above movement relates directly to the short squeeze... but it will. Because there are now 10-15M shares tied up in the clearing houses, there are now even **fewer** shares to be borrowed. There are estimates that the true short interest on this stock was around 300%. Now, with about 20% of the total float **committed to the fucking clearing house** as they sort out Friday's shitshow, I expect true short interest is closer to 500%. 

Demand for GME will continue to pump on Monday. This is a cultural event now, where every lay person can be a modern-day Robin Hood. The shorts are going to have their positions closed whether they like it or not if this continues (which it will). Since there are far *far* **far** fewer shares floating over the next 2 trading days, though, a squeeze on Monday or Tuesday could utterly destroy Melvin and the other shorts. 

If RC even opens his twitter app this weekend, it's over.

I am making this post because I love this community and I want it to stay up for as long as possible. Since our community is starting to get very big right now and get a lot of media attention it is important that we think about what we comment and post. As a reddit user since many years back I have seen and been a part of communities that were shut down. Let me give you some exampels.

r/WatchPeopleDie ‚ô∞15 March 2019 was a controversial subreddit from the very beginning since the main focus was to post media of real-life human deaths. After many years of complaints it was allowed to stay up as a quarantined subreddit. So what happend? The Christchurch shooting happened, long story made short a dude livestreamed a video of himself shooting up a mosque. Government agencies in different countries told people in general to not spread the video, guess what WPD did? Ye they posted the video... many times. But reddit didn't ban them immediately, they removed the posts they found and posted a sticky on the subreddit where reddit staff urged the users to not FUCKING POST THE VIDEO. But WPD went full retard and kept posting it. In a blink of an eye the whole subreddit was deleted, wiped from the face of this earth, gone forever. This went fast too, literally all of this happened within one day. For the same reason r/Gore ‚ô∞15 March 2019 was banned within 10 minutes after WPD.

r/Physical_Removal ‚ô∞15 August 2017 advocated/joked/memed about violence against leftists but was allowed to exist because after all you know it's just memes lol. Then during the Unite the right rally in Charlottesville a person was killed by a car driven by a rightwinger. This sub went full retard and started to mock the dead person by being offensive and posting pictures/videos of the incident. This caused huge media attention and thereby pressure on reddit which resulted in the ban.

r/DarkNetMarkets was a sub that was mostly about discussion about markets and vendors. This was enough for US authorities to pressure reddit on information about users on there and probably the reason why they removed it. People never actually sold stuff over this subreddit, but the discussion about the darknet markets was enough.

r/pizzagate was a sub dedicated to the pizzagate conspiracy and was banned because they doxed a person believed to be a part of the conspiracy.

This is just a few examples of communities that I know about and some of them I myself was a part of. Many more communities have been deleted than the ones mentioned here that I don't even know about. And I am getting worried about WSB because I am starting to see resemblances with WSB and subreddits that were shutdown.

1. We are starting to pick fights with people in the real world out there while at the same time the memes are getting more aggressive. We don't want to pick fights with the wrong people/institutions, now it turns out Citron was just a guy in an apartment lol, but next time? We picking fights with large banks? SEC? Remember the examples above, government agencies have put pressure on reddit before to shut shit down, if they want to get rid of us believe me they can do it.
2. Media attention is getting big. This is not good, media have put pressure on reddit before as I showed you above, if we upset them, fuck with them, pick fight with them or whatever that makes them not like us the media can fuck us back hard just like before.
3. Pump-and-dump of a stock is illegal and we don't want to fuck with the law. Remember above, r/darknetmarkets was only discussing illegal stuff not doing it on the subreddit but that was still enough for big government to fuck them. What you are doing when you write stuff like ""LET US PUMP XXX ROCKETSHIP EMOJI"" is giving them a reason to fuck us so stop doing it.
4. Stop doxing. Remember r/pizzagate was banned because of doxing. So when u dox this Citron guy and send pizza to his fucking place that's putting the whole subreddit at risk.

I don't want WSB to end up in the same graveyard as my other beloved subreddits that are lying there. So think about what you are commenting and posting, we got the media watching us right now and maybe even government agencies are taking interest in us too. And most important of all, if the admins on reddit tell us to stop doing something then u fucking stop doing that thing. Because if it goes that far the admins probably have CIA breathing down their necks.

Also backup subs doesn't work it has already been tried before. r/beatingwomen tried r/beatingwomen2, r/incels tried r/braincells... didn't work. So if we wanna make a backup plan we need to get more sophisticated, maybe create our own platform.

The shit-tier level of journalism covering the GME saga has been a fucking disgrace. Half of it is plain financial illiteracy, and the other half is inter-generational bashing and fear-mongering. You think it's been bad thus far? The squeeze hasn't even really set off yet, can you imagine what happens next week when the stock hits the low triple digits? Eventually to 420.69? End game of 1000$+? Lets recap what has happened so far:

**False media narrative #1**: Recent rise of GME is due to sHorT sQuoZe!!!1! 

**Reality**: GME is an undervalued company & a turnaround story. Investors are finally starting to notice. Short squeeze hasn't even started yet.

*January 13th* - We had our first breakout to 30$ from the sub-20$ doldrums, the shit-tier level reporting started immediately. The media went balls deep on the short squeeze narrative despite absolutely no evidence that shorts had covered at all. Rather it was just long buyers piling in. For example, [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-13/heavily-shorted-gamestop-soars-most-ever-as-day-traders-circle) titles their article ""GameStop Surges Most Ever in Short Squeeze After Cohen Move"" despite quoting Ihor Dusaniwsky stating the opposite in the body of the article.

*January 14-15th* - The stock bounced from the mid to high 30's. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2021/01/15/with-138-short-interest-board-change-sends-gamestop-stock-soaring/?sh=21052b426da8) reports ""What drove up GameStop‚Äôs shares was a short-squeeze on steroids."" despite no evidence to support that claim and while quoting Ihor Dusaniwsky saying the actual catalyst was due to stronger holiday sales & board shakeup. 

*January 22nd* - GME breaks out yet again - hitting the low 70's before settling to the 60's. [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/gamestop-soars-nearly-70percent-trading-briefly-halted-amid-epic-short-squeeze.html) proceeds to again spread the falsehood about ""massive short covering"" with absolutely no evidence to back that up. Rather the bump was a result of a gamma squeeze.

**False media narrative #2**: Rabid retail investors are victimizing the poor short sellers 

**Reality**: Short sellers have been conducting illegal naked short selling to drive a company employing tens of thousands to bankruptcy.

[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/gamestop-tug-of-war-gives-reddit-army-a-win-on-record-volatility) blithly characterizes reddit as an ""angry mob"" out to attack poor little Citron. Bullshit, an angry mob is what stormed DC on Jan 6th, not a bunch of random individuals that left internet comments you didn't agree with on your youtube video. No mention of Citron's far shadier and illicit history. 

[Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/gamestop-stock-wall-street-bets-short-squeeze/) re-urgitates Andrew Left's baseless claims of being ""hacked"" and ""harrassed by pizza deliveries"". No mention of Citron's ¬†track-record of making baseless fraud allegation and market manupulation

[WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/short-bets-pummel-hot-hedge-fund-melvin-capital-11611349217) sympathetically mentioned ""Many investors have complained about short squeezes that have left them nursing losses."" and then going on to write a gushing biography about Gabe Plotkin. No mention of illegal naked short selling or that Gabe drove GME all the way down to 3$ but was too greedy to lock in his profits.

We, the retail investors, didn't do shit other than invest into a company that deserves a second chance. The shorts put themselves into a precarious situation through their own greed and illegal naked short selling. The media wants to punch down on the ""easy"" target: Reddit and WSB. Reddit is scary to boomers who can barely navigate the reddit UI, let alone get an erection. They prefer facebook, where fake news can be piped directly into their senile brains. This mis-information will just get worse from here on out.

We can and should push back, not by some centralized WSB twitter handle, but by what we do best: acting as individual retail investors who advocate for the truth on our soapboxes of choice.

TL;DR - Stay strong and üíéü§ö. Don‚Äôt be afraid to correct the fucking record."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001720.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['GME', 'GME', 'T', 'GME', 'GME', 'DC', 'GME', 'WSB', 'UI', 'WSB', 'DR']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Plan:
Take your closed positions that you lost money on, and turn them green.

Because I think it's a great exercise to improve your day trading.

This is because I have seen a post where the actual float was far lower than reported at a dismal 30 million shares out of 70 million.  If this is true it only leaves 30 million shares to be traded on the market, but this is greatly reduced because of the Gamma squeeze on Friday. Due to the amount of calls that ended up ITM (all of them) roughly 10-15 million shares will be tied up until Tuesday according to other other DD I saw posted here tonight. 

Why is this important? This leaves roughly 15-20 million shares actively trading which is an extremely small float for the volume. This will make any moves far more extreme than usual. This is further reduced by the üíé ‚úã üêÇ here who own approximately 8-10% of shares this amounts to about 7 million shares. If we assume half of us will not sell Monday and provide liquidity, there will be 11.5-16.5 million shares being traded. 

Any price movement will be extreme Monday higher or lower. News can swing this stock into triple digits or back down to 20$(extreme example not going to happen).  So if shorts get margin called Monday expect the price to accelerate rapidly higher.  There is also the possibility of another gamma ramp up if too many retards buy far OTM calls, but dealers will likely have something up there sleeve to prevent a repeat of Friday 


This is not financial advice in any way.
I also have a long position of 130 shares at 18$ cost basis.

And a look at recent news.

As a long on Nokia, I have been lurking this sub and I see a lot of the same misconceptions about Nokia and well, I believe its time for me to bring some clarity to the reality that is $NOK

**Myth #1 Nokia is a phone company.**

This is wrong, Nokia is not a phone company. They sold their phone business to Microsoft back in 2013 for over 7 billion dollars, later it was sold by Microsoft to HMD for 350 million dollars in 2016, who currently makes the phones. Nokia just gets royalties for the use of their name.

**Myth #2 Nokia has been under the same failed management for 25 years.**

Correction, Nokia hired on a new CEO Pekka Lundmark in August of 2020 and took full leadership in September. He previously worked for Nokia between 1990 and 2000, when he helped oversee the company‚Äôs emergence as the world‚Äôs biggest mobile phone manufacturer and a significant player in mobile infrastructure.

**Myth #4 Nokia is losing market share due to competition**

While yes, there is strong competition in the 5G market, Huawei the global leader, is facing bans across the United States and Europe, ZTE who makes up a small fraction of the market share is also seeing geopolitical pressure. Current estimates of market share show the following Huawei 28.5% Ericsson 26.5% Nokia 22% Samsung 8.5% ZTE 5% and others 9.5%.

Here is an updated list on each countries stance on Huawei and ZTE. The list is growing as more and more countries decide to venture away from Chinese telecommunication equipment.

With more countries joining on the list, there is an increase demand on the others within the market to pick up the lost market share.

**Myth #5 Nokia isn‚Äôt a cyber security company like BlackBerry**

Nokia actually is involved in the cyber security field in many important ways. Nokia Smart Grid for example, is designed specifically for one of our largest threats faced by modern nations, Power Utilities.

Nokia Cuts Jobs in France

Staying in Europe, Nokia said it was cutting 1,233 jobs in France, largely impacting research and development positions at its Alcatel-Lucent subsidiary.

Nokia has been slashing jobs amid a global cost savings program originally announced in late 2018. ‚ÄúNokia is reinforcing its efforts and has earlier launched a global evaluation of its \[research and development\] operation that has led to significant adjustments globally,‚Äù a company spokesperson said in a statement.

The Finnish vendor, which is trying to cut $556 million in costs by the end of 2020, announced plans to cut about 180 jobs in its home country at the beginning of the year and hinted at more to come.

I haven‚Äôt seen anything like it.

Last week was exhausting (and I was mainly just watching...)

No doubt people are drained from stress, flying, falling, fear, ecstasy. This is especially true if you‚Äôve partaken in drugs, alcohol, sex. No judgement, I just want you to do your laundry after the ecstasy to prepare for whatever is to come. Blood or angels. 

Many no doubt have wins and losses, and there is a huge amount of depletion that occurs inside of the brain and body after serious events. People need to refuel. It will help sharpen you for the coming week. 

Tips: 

- Go for a walk/stroll outside. Smell anything out there. 

- Eat a balanced diet today. Load up on veggies and fruits. Drink a lot of water. A lot.

- Make dinner with your family. 

- Crack jokes.

- Take a cold shower (‚ÄúWim Hof method‚Äù).

- Express and feel gratitude, starting with basic things like the fact you have eyes and can see. Try for 3 things, even if you are down. 

- Search your maps for a float therapy (‚Äúisolation tank‚Äù, ‚Äúfloating‚Äù, ‚Äúsensory deprivation‚Äù). This usually costs $70 and is a pinnacle experience. Trust me. I‚Äôve been floating for years and you bet your ass I went today.

- If you can‚Äôt do the above, meditate.

The case against QNX.|t3_l3vs7e|0.76|1146|1146|top|2021-01-24 11:38:53.000000|TheCloudTamer|456|DD|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3vs7e/bb_bear_dd_the_case_against_qnx/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3vs7e/bb_bear_dd_the_case_against_qnx/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3vs7e/bb_bear_dd_the_case_against_qnx/|"Listen up. It's hard for a gay bear to say no to some BB; however, I miss the good quality bear posts and I'm not taking any more of the glittery $BB DD lying down. This post is a critique of positive remarks made about BlackBerry QNX. This is not financial advice. Welcome to the casino.

tl;dr QNX is not high-tech, isn't primed for crazy growth and isn't something that can milk a monopoly position.  üåàüêª 

The retards with their bullish DD for $BB are getting off on explaining RTOS, the impenetrable security, the moat of standards, QNX's usage count, the EV & autonomous car revolution, and IVY. All of these points are weak and don't combine to create a strong bundle of sticks.  

**RTOS**  
Stop throwing around the term RTOS like it's magic. An RTOS is just OS that lets tasks ask to be run within a certain time. Engineering students spin up basic RTOSs in half-semester courses. Sure QNX is going to be vastly more complicated than a student project, but stop throwing around ""RTOS"" like it's secret tech.

**""It's so secure!""**  
Known vulnerability counts of a software can be low for non-flattering reasons: the software is not open-source, no-one cares to hack it, there arn't many features and the software doesn't change fast. I think that the autonomous and EV progress will increase scrutiny of automotive software and we will start to see some QNX bugs. In addition, the pressure on QNX to start adding features faster will also bring some bugs. Random speculation: I bet that there are some zero-day vulnerabilities of QNX known to organizations like the NSA.

**""But QNX has a moat! Look at all these safety standards.""**  
These safely standards are a shitty moat that will backfire. 
In general, I think safety standards for software are a joke. Check out this [PDF guide to ISO 26262](https://www.feabhas.com/sites/default/files/2016-06/A%20quick%20guide%20to%20ISO%2026262%5B1%5D_0_0.pdf). The standard focus on, among other things, to ""use style guides"" and ""use naming convection"" and ""restrict coupling between software components"". The whole standard seems like a joke.

One illuminating document I found titled ""Tesla comments on the cyber security regulation interpretation document"" ([source](https://globalautoregs.com/participants/409-tesla)) is Tesla making recommendations on how to update the W.29 standards. It has the following passage:

> ""We believe the current regulations and interpretations extensively consider the context of a traditional OEM ""model-year"" release rate, but do not factor in the perspective of a company that releases software at a faster rate than once or twice per year - similar to the model used by every other modern internet-connected consumer device. The current regulations and interpretations do not fully consider the overhead introduced to a manufacturer that releases software at a frequent pace. We believe is the direction the entire industry will move in, especially to address security and safety considerations. Any requirement to submit documentation, or wait for approval, for every individual software release will compromise velocity and agility; and works against the goals of a cyber security strategy. The regulation should be designed so it is based on evaluation of the manufacturer's internal processes, appropriate records of activities, and trust between manufacturers and authorities.""

Claims that Tesla is having difficulty passing these standards carry truth but are misguided; the standards are archaic and don't fit with modern software development and Tesla is contributing to these standards being rewritten. 

**""Look at the 175 million vehicles using QNX!""**  
Is this an argument for growth or for a monopoly? An argument for growth shouldn't be ""QNX already has a large % market penetration"". In comparison, the growth argument for EVs and self-driving cars is that there are hardly any now, and in 30 years most cars will be EVs with self-driving capabilities. If QNX has X% of the market now, I need evidence for why this will grow. Instead, if you are arguing that QNX has a monopoly, this also seems flawed. A quick google finds other companies have automotive platforms, such as GreenHills software which claims also to be ""Proven in Hundreds of Millions of Vehicles"" and also meets the standards such as ISO 26262. 

I'm pretty sure nearly every car released in the last 20 years runs an OS of some sort. It's used to run tasks like like controlling the breaks, turning on your window wipers, lights, sound etc. RTOS is already a fundamental requirement of cars. Saying things like ""EVs and self-driving cars means BB to the moon"" is like saying we should invest in air bag companies because of strong growth of EVs and self-driving cars.

**BlackBerry IVY**  
I don't get how this is huge news. The press release is vague on the details.  What actually is BlackBerry contributing here? What does BlackBerry get? 50/50 of what? Amazon wants everyone using AWS and will be happy to make deals to get people onto AWS. My guess is that AWS just needs a partner to figure out a good way to design some good APIs for car data. BlackBerry will be useful to AWS for a few years and then discarded. 

**Talent**  
Bullish $BB DD doesn't even cover this, and it's probably one of the most important factors. A software companies long term advantage is it's strength to attract top talent. I don't see BB being able to compete in this game at all. I encourage people to check out some of the reviews of [BlackBerry QNX on Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/QNX-Software-Systems-Reviews-E9037.htm). It seems that most employees enjoy working an QNX but think that the parent company BlackBerry is dragging them down. Poor QNX doesn't even have a separate careers page‚Äîyou get redirected to BlackBerry's career page which mixes all of their departments together on one page. Furthermore, looking at LinkedIn profiles of [current BlackBerry QNX employees](https://www.linkedin.com/company/blackberryqnx/people/) shows that the developer workforce is heavy on the old-guard and doesn't seem to have much young top-tier talent. If $BB can moon, maybe it can attract more talent, but currently, I think talent is going to be a serious issue for BlackBerry QNX.

**Parting sentiment**  
QNX will either continue to be a low level RTOS that moves your window wipers, or they will be squeezed-out as car companies or companies like Cruise or Deep Scale develop their own low-level OS or use an open-source one. I bought BB in the hype and I think there is a strong case for it being undervalued, but I place a low probability on BB becoming some automotive superstar based on QNX. 

Position: I have 160 BB shares.

Edit: emoji  
Edit 2: links for LinkedIn and Glassdoor.  
Edit 3: a lot of you retards overlook arguments and base your opinion solely on me getting high on GME. I love wsb and I don‚Äôt want it becoming more of an echo chamber. I wrote about BB as I‚Äôm familiar with running software companies and the bull DDs for BB are cringe.

&#x200B;

Long read here but there is analogy using the Magic School bus so........yeah.

TL:DR: at bottom.

I've seen far too many people on this sub, Stinktwits, Tweeter, CNBC, WSJ, Barron's etc. incorrectly state that WSB is controlling GME.  We have not, nor will we ever be in control of GME.  Simply put, our \~5% ownership isn't enough to push the price around.  As much as you retards, and the retard(s) on CNBC, and the retards on print media WANT everyone to believe it, its just not true so I wanted to clarify a few things going forward.

First, the media, Shitron, and others are trying to paint WSB as a collective or a whole entity, and NOT as a group of individuals.  This claim is baseless, and has been mentioned here before but of course that won't stop them.  If in fact we were a collective, that would set a dangerous precedent and we would almost certainly be shut down.  Think of like Pirate Bay. If one person illegally uploads a movie that person is in violation of the law, but if 10000 people upload a couple seconds of said movie, and those pieces are stitched together it becomes a lot harder to make it illegal.

The story of GME began much like M. Burry's big short began - someone looked!  That person was r/DeepFuckingValue (and M. Burry, himself).  Let's use the Magic School Bus as an example. DFV is played by Ms. Frizzle. Here she comes around the bend in her little short bus on route to pick you mini autists up, but when she opens the door to the bus no one gets on!  Ms. Frizzle is not discouraged, so she wrangles you retards up and throws you on the bus.  Off you go on the adventure of your life, launching into the stratosphere to discover a new planet further than the Moon and Mars. You name this newly found planet Valhalla.  When you return you can't stop telling people about your trip!

This is where we get to my point.  We are in control of the SENTIMENT surrounding GME, not the price.   You little autists have seen valhalla already, and can't stop telling others about how magical it is. Soon enough, other autists want to ride the short bus out to Valhalla, and so they buy their tickets (stonks) and then they tell their friends etc etc.  Take Tesla for example (with a P/E of 1700), does that stop the ~~retards~~ geniuses from buying?

This is what we are doing to GME.  We didn't push our weight around as WSB and somehow, singlehandedly destroy the shorts.  No, retail just doesn't have that kind of power (hence why its B.S the media is pushing the narrative...LOL though they sure know how to make an autist blush).  WSB somehow, SOMEHOW edgeukated enough people on the GME story about how undervalued they were, financially healthy they were, how shorted the stock was, Lord Cohen et al, etc, and the story took off.

You see? We are controlling the SENTIMENT around GME which in turn, is controlling the price.  Lets continue this going forward because its what got us to where we are.  If we really want this squeeze to happen there is going to have to be conviction on behalf of the buyers.  So go out there and edgeukate more people on the stock that everyone missed (apart from you DFV (xoxo) and Burry).

Make sure they know this ain't no pump and dump. Everyone gets caught up in the stonk price when they should be looking at market cap.  Sure, we hit the highest price last week, but not the highest  market cap GME has ever had. In reality, we've just recently corrected to the proper valuation GME should have been at all along (if it weren't for those greedy shorts!).

So next time you post about GME, make sure you remind people about the above points and the fact that  the squeeze hasn't squoze yet, and that RC and Reggie Fils Aime are now driving this short bus!

You keep the SENTIMENT high, the stonk price goes more uppies.

(someone add a rocket emoji...or perhaps a school bus?)

TL/DR:  WSB is controlling the SENTIMENT around GME, not the price.

##If you haven't noticed,  all eyes are on /r/wallstreetbets right now and a certain narrative is being pushed around to make it seem as if this community is disorderly and reckless. What I think is happening is that you guys are making such an impact that these fat cats are worried that they have to get up and put in work to earn a living.    

##Some of these guys traditionally used the media as a tool for them to manipulate the market have failed to further line their pockets and now want to accuse you guys as being manipulators. This is complete nonsense because **ALL** content in /r/wallstreetbets is organic, created only by its users. You guys choose what you like and do what you want to do as individuals.

##There is **NO** organized effort by those us who moderate this community to *promote, advise or recommend any stock*.  It is against our policy to do so and we feel it is crucial to allow members to be able to share their ideas amongst each other with autonomy.  

##The only time we intervene is when we notice any unscrupulous characters appear thinking they can take advantage of our members.  We do our best to identify them quickly and remove them from our community.


##There have been accusations of some inappropriate conduct coming from this community. These are baseless accusations as I have not seen any evidence of this taking place here. You guys know better but I'm going to say it anyway for those who have only recently joined this community that we don't do that stuff here.
  
##People like to talk shit about you when you're a winner, it just comes with the territory.  The way a winner responds is by keeping your head up high and enjoy living rent-free inside the minds of those who doubted you. They'll stare you down as you walk by them with a smile as wide as the sky. You don't even notice them because you're too busy basking in all the glorious tendies you've made.  They hate that you played by the rules and still won.

##That fuzzy sensation you are feeling is called RESPECT and it is well earned.  Wall Street no longer dismisses your presence anymore. The smart ones know that you guys do things differently and will adapt in ways to accommodate you and how you as the next generation want things done.  You should all be proud of yourselves.

This is one of the most concise points made in an article I've read in a while, and they simply don't list any of the other catalysts for the stock. No mention of Cathie Woods accumulating shares, no mention of demo day on the horizon. No mention of the float structure and Mithril potentially buying the locked up shares. 

Seriously, who writes this stuff? It's almost like the chief editors of every financial publication agency are telling people to only write about WSB. This is really weird and it gives me the heebie jeebies. How can someone claiming to be a professional financial publication simply omits so many key facts about PLTR?

‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù
Between November 10, 2020 and January 20, 2021, the Company sold 3.6 million shares of its common stock resulting in $466.8 million in net proceeds at a weighted average sales price of $131.95 per share pursuant to its At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with the Sales Agent, dated as of November 10, 2020 (the ‚ÄúNovember 2020 Sales Agreement‚Äù), leaving $27.2 million remaining under the November 2020 Sales Agreement as of January 20, 2021. The Company and the Sales Agent terminated the November 2020 Sales Agreement by mutual agreement on the date hereof.
‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù

So the reason we haven‚Äôt seen a run up to data release is because they were selling shares at $132. 

The company also filed for AN ADDITIONAL $500MM ATM offering. 

**************************************************

NVAX has added a supply chain exec and a regulatory exec, refreshed their ATM offering for an additional 500MM. 

News is coming soon. 

The pop may be dampened or may experience a dip on market open when it happens.

A software for your car that makes it smarter than all you retards in this community combined. They make alot of other products and has historically been very innovative products (yes maybe not when mr stevey jobs smashed it with the smartphone). But all of that does not really matter.

 What matters now is the WSB megamainstream storm that we are currently in and will be after the gme squeeze is over (which its not, it just got the start signal last friday). But look at this now, GME was thought to be a blockbuster company but hardcore WSBers did their homework and unleashed the massive autist attack. WSB saw a big increase in traders during 2020, globally we went from roughly 4-5% retail traders to a staggering 20% in 2020. 

We are getting unprecedented attention, they see us as the community that revived a dying brick and mortar retailer and surged the stock price. The same goes for $BB. The company was seen as a dying one when they couldn't keep up with their competitors in the phone game. They have completely changed and with this GME thing, people will jump on the rocket ship like never before since $BB has garnered huge attention in the mists of  the GME play. New hoards of people are lurking in this subreddit trying to find our next play. If you like money this train has not even left the station yet and the price is still a steal.

There are incredible ideas and ideas that are so dumb that a monkey throwing darts would pick better stocks (oops). Fortunately, or unfortunately, it seems both types of ideas can make you money. 

To the people buying travel stock during a global pandemic when airliners are flying at 20% capacity (or less) or Hertz... it‚Äôs gambling. I support people doing what they want with their money, but following blind idiots who are maxing a credit card for a trade is fucking moronic. At times, it‚Äôs like watching a retiree throw away hundreds of dollars a day at a slot machine. 

I believe for every dollar made here, two dollars are lost. Seeing someone, such as DFV, make $11m off $50k is the greatest advertisement ever. Many will see it and ask, how did he do it? They will ‚Äúlearn,‚Äù aka have no fucking idea, what an option is and proceed to lose thousands with the hope of making millions and quitting their job all while simultaneously getting revenge on their wife‚Äôs boyfriend.

This is meant to be a basic introduction to options prices. I am not a financial professional and this should not be misconstrued as investment advice. 

This will probably be long so **TL;DR:** Stop throwing away your money and learn about what you're buying. If you don't want to read [mike and his whiteboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmQ20J_3K7Q&list=PLPVve34yolHY43YaBegHMzN9WjrTnQfFr&ab_channel=tastytrade) is a good resource (I am not affiliated in any way). 

Initially wrote this at the end but I think it's better at the beginning:
**Practical Applications, General Advice**
-
General pointers for the newbies. Most of the option trading shown on WSB is OTM naked calls or puts with expiration < 3 weeks (*FDs*). **These are like lotto tickets and are not considered responsible investments by anyone, including us. They are retarded and we know it. You should know it too before buying.** Theta is usually insane and probability you make money is slim. On the flip side, selling these options is sometimes considered ok but is often **referred to as picking up pennies in front of a steamroller** due to the low return for high risk. If you want to preserve your hard earned money, make responsible plays. With options that usually means **~3 months minimum expiration, and strikes somewhat close to the money, if not in the money.** Consider the implications of IV in your trades, and make sure you understand the mechanics of the options before opening spreads. 

-------------

Options Basics

An option is a contract that gives you the option to buy (**call**) or sell (**put**) 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (the **strike price**) at or before a certain date (the **expiration date**). Options are priced **per share**, so a call with a listed price of $1 will cost you $100 total for 1 contract ($1 x 100 shares). For American style options (what most of you are trading) you can exercise at any time before the strike price, while European options (which are sold for major indices on American markets) can only be exercised on the expiration date. That doesn't matter too much for our purposes but I'll get into that later (EDIT: I never elaborated. This is really only important for [box spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boxspread.asp#:~:text=A%20box%20spread%20is%20an,strike%20prices%20and%20expiration%20dates.). They aren't allowed on RH and have their [own history here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zW86yXg7RM&ab_channel=MHFIN). Don't bother with them). 

Options have both intrinsic and extrinsic value. **Intrinsic value** is what that option would be worth at expiration. For example, if you have a $60 call in gamestop, and gamestop stock is at $65, your intrinsic value is $65-$60 = $5 (the difference your strike price vs what price you can sell it on the open market). An option will only have intrinsic value if it is **in the money (ITM)**, which means price is above strike for calls and below strike for puts. **Extrinsic value** is the time value of the option, and will vary based on the **implied volatility (IV)** of the option. The definition of implied volatility is complicated and tends towards circular logic if you apply it practically, but generally it can be thought of as how much options traders expect the underlying to move. If the stock moves a lot, IV goes up. If there's a big event, like an earnings report, IV goes up. If that earnings report passes, or the stock stabilizes, IV goes down. IV varies greatly depending from one stock to another and can change drastically depending on numerous circumstances, but as a generalization anything < 30% IV could be considered low and anything > 100% IV could be considered high. **Out of the money** options (price below strike for calls and above strike for puts), have value that is entirely extrinsic- for that reason they tend to have larger percent moves than ITM options. 


Greeks 

The greeks can be an intimidating topic but are extremely important if you want to trade spreads (more on this later) and I would argue anyone buying options should have a basic understanding of the greeks. This will be geared towards average/wsb investors, I'm not going to get into the other greeks here because they usually aren't as important for our purposes.

**Delta**: How much the option price will move relative to moves in the the share price. Positive for calls and negative for puts. It ranges 0-1, delta of 1 is equivalent to holding 100 shares, delta 0.5 is equivalent of holding 50 shares. Simple enough. This will increase as you are in the money and decrease if you are out of the money. An at the money option will typically have 0.5 delta, a far ITM option will have delta close to 1.

**Theta**: How much time value the option will lose per day. This is >0 (technically <0 if you are short, more on this later). A theta of 0.1 means the value of the option will lose $0.10/share/day, or $10/day. Theta increases as the expiration date becomes closer, so an option expiring this week will lose more money/day than one expiring next month (given same strike). For options of the same expirations, it will typically highest at the money and decreases as you move further ITM or OTM. [EDIT: Corrected]

**Gamma**: Rate of change of delta. This represents how much delta will change as the stock price moves. This is highest for near the money options and lowest for far ITM or far OTM options. 

**Vega**: Change in option price relative to on change in IV. High vega means the price moves a lot with changes in IV. This will increase with the amount of time left on the contract (more time = higher vega) and is typically highest at the money strikes and lowest for far ITM or OTM strikes. 

Buying/Selling Options

Just like stocks you can buy or sell individual contracts. You can also create positions that combine both long and short options, these are known as spreads. Individual contracts are fairly easy to understand and trade, though they typically come with higher risk and higher reward than their spread counterparts. 

**Long vs Short:** You can buy or sell options. Buyers can sell or exercise their contracts to close the position. Buyers need the stock price to move for their position to profit. Shorts can buy to close or wait for the option to expire. They will profit if the price stays the same (from theta) or moves in their favor. Increases in IV will help longs and hurt shorts, decreases in IV will hurt longs and help shorts.

**Calls:** Bulls buy calls. Their maximum loss is the initial cost of the call, their max profit is uncapped. They lose theta. Bears can sell calls (**naked calls**), their maximum loss is unlimited and their max profit is the initial price of the call. They gain theta.

**Puts:** Bears buy puts. Their max loss is the initial price of their put, their max profit is the strike price (stock can't go lower than zero), they lose theta. Bulls can sell puts (**naked puts**), their maximum loss is the strike price of the contract (stock price can't go below zero) minus the initial cost of the contract, their max profit is the initial price of the put. 

**Spreads:** Combination of a buy and a sell. These come in all different forms and allow all sorts of strategies that are impossible with shares or naked positions. In general there are **credit spreads** which is when you sell the spread and receive money up front, and **debit spreads**, which you buy the spread pay up front. When constructing spreads it's useful to know that the resulting greeks will be the sum of the greeks from all the contracts in the spread. So if you buy a call with delta 0.5 and sell a call with delta 0.25, your overall delta is 0.5-0.25=0.25. I'm only going to cover a few here because I'm getting tired but just know there are a ton of options trading strategies out there.

**Vertical Spread:** Buy and sell different strikes at the same expiration. For example, if I'm bullish on GME I can buy $60 calls and sell $65 calls for 1/29 (debit spread). The cost of the $60 call is offset by the $65, but the profit is capped at $5 per contract. Theta is lower (and can be negative) although delta and gamma are also lower. It's important to note that when the position is ITM, the overall spread price will be less than the intrinsic value of the spread due to the extrinsic value of the short leg (until you're insanely far ITM). For example, that $60-65 vertical spread will be worth <$5 even if GME is $75. The price of the spread will approach its intrinsic value as the remaining time on the contract approaches 0. I can also sell a vertical spread (credit spread), I will receive the difference in value of the two contracts and will need cash collateral to cover the difference between the strikes. For example, I can sell a $65 put and buy a $60 put. Since the $65 put is worth more I receive a credit (lets say $200), then I also need to put up $300 in additional collateral. If GME goes above $65 I can wait for the contract to expire useless or buy it back for cheaper than I sold it. If it goes below $65 my loses are offset by the $200 credit. If it goes below $60 my losses are capped at $300 by my long put (I buy shares at 65, sell at 60) and initial credit received.

**Iron condor:** Combination of two OTM vertical spreads, typically of the same width. Most people trade these short, the nice thing about that is your collateral can be shared between the call and put side, because there is no way for both sides to be ITM at the same time. If you're short you make money if stock price stays the same or if volatility goes down (basically the same thing). 

**Horizontal spreads:** Buy and sell the same strike at different expirations. AKA calendar spreads. Most useful for betting on changes in volatility. A long calendar spread (sell close expiration buy long) will be long volatility, a short calendar spread (buy close expiration sell long) is short volatility. You can also use this strategy for earnings plays, when you know the short dated options will lose more volatility than long dated options. These are most valuable near the money and will lose value as they go farther ITM or OTM. For this reason some traders will incorporate both OTM puts and calls into these positions. Calls are delta neutral at the money, slightly delta positive OTM, and slightly delta negative ITM (reverse for puts). 


That's all I have the energy for. Feel free to ask questions. Good luck out there.

# Mother of all TA for the Mother of All Squeezes

# WHY GME WILL SQUEEZE MORE THAN ONCE

Warning ‚Äì no rocket emojis or wife‚Äôs boyfriend jokes here. The tendies we are about to suckle upon are above jokes. This is serious fucking tendies. Intergalactic fucking tendies.

&#x200B;

Just some hardcore TA to confirm your bias. There are charts and math. Sorry. But if you read the charts and can take your pants off to count to .05mm then you‚Äôll find out that the shorters are fucking fucked fuckily. And there‚Äôs math to prove it.

&#x200B;

If you do read the linked TA/DD (which I know 98% of you won‚Äôt) I hope you can use it as a way to get ahead without having to spend the time I did to look all this up and learn it.

&#x200B;

I am not in finance and I‚Äôm not going to lie and said I spent 40 hours a week reading up on this for months. I‚Äôve just done the homework and took the time to learn how the Wall Street chads talk.   
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCIo4MCO-_U

&#x200B;

Here is the summary:

1.	There will not be ***a*** GME squeeze.
2.	There will be at least two. There could be more.  I need some people less retarded than me to check my math on this.
3.	Tomorrow I‚Äôll buy GME calls ‚Äì even deeply OTM. Weeklies could be fine. Go further ou if you don‚Äôt want the risk. EDIT: as u/StarSwitch taught me, ATM calls and calls closer to share price will cause MMs to cover it with shares. So calls up and down the call chain are muy bueno and shit.  
4.	All fucking hell may break loose on Thursday morning. The NYSE reports short position at market close on Wednesday.  Some analysts are quietly saying that shorts could be 300-400% of the float now. 
5.	I‚Äôm already in on GME shares (over 1700) but I‚Äôll buy more. (Positions at bottom of post)
6.	EVERY SINGLE indicator shows massive upward momentum on GME.
7.	GME momentum is going to create a massive upward feedback loop. The combination of options gamma squeeze, available float, and short interest makes it impossible for shorters to escape.
8.	Normally, shorters deep underwater could hedge their losses by buying call options.
9.	But buying call options decreases the float and the only tightens the squeeze. It‚Äôs like fighting against quicksand for the shorters.
10. This GME squeeze is going to be historic because of the compounding effect of options and short interest.
11. This could be bigger than the VW/Porsche infinity squeeze. But it‚Äôs completely different from VW ‚Äì so don‚Äôt draw too many comparisons.
12. This squeeze could happen without Papa Cohen action but if Cohen does anything soon then GME is going to uncharted territory somewhere in another universe (forget the moon or some other place in this universe.)

They are a *security company*. Revenue does not care about your AI driven autonomous machine learning EV car with DDs. People are using these terms loosely. A quick lookup for interviews with John Chen would prove that he explicitly avoids these terms as they do not define nor matter to the products/revenue of BlackBerry. QNX revenue does not depend on any of these terms, it's on installation on any device. This includes the space station, of which there is 1 of with obviously non-recurring revenue. Buying based on these basis would be gambling.

**Bull**:

* Business transformation: BlackBerry is now a software company, starting the transformation in 2015. The focus is security, the general term.
* 5 Products:
   * QNX: Embedded system OS.
      * Multi-OS housing: It has the capability to allow for multiple OSs on a single chip.
      * Real-time availability/software prioritization: Not all pieces of software operate on the same priority. Steering/braking would be higher priority than media, and QNX allows for that. Even if the thread/core is shared with other applications, when high priority software is requesting a resource it will be prioritized to ensure reliability.
      * Resource sharing: CPU, RAM, and GPU resource sharing between different applications capability. Two applications can share the same CPU core and bump each other based on prioritization.
      * Why not Linux? QNX has the highest certification for security available. Linux does not. CEOs would want to avoid liability and this certification allows for that.
      * Device agnostic: It can be installed on any device, not just cars. Any IoT and offline device can use QNX.
   * QNX Hypervisor: Consolidate multiple OSs on a single SoC using virtualization
      * SoC: System on a chip. Instead of using multiple ECUs, which is what car manufacturers currently do, they can use one single chip to run multiple high priority applications and multiple OSs. This is what Tesla does now.
      * Virtualization: Running an OS in a virtual environment. Think Linux environment inside of Windows. This helps with debugging for developers without having to have the actual hardware.
   * IVY: Scalable cloud-connected software platform for vehicles.
      * What is it a solution for? When a vehicle manufacturer wants a way to transmit the QNX/OS data safely, normalize it, and visualize it/interact with it. It also allows car manufacturers to own the data, unlike other OSs.
      * Scalable: AWS servers are capable of handling the load from many endpoints.
      * Software platform: There is currently no centralized software ecosystem for vehicles. IVY is providing that.
      * Non-BB developers would be able to use an SDK to develop applications on IVY for infotainment/general apps/others. IVY will also use ML to gain insight on unrecognized patterns by developers. An example of this is detecting if a car slipped, without having the developer connect multiple sensors to figure out if that event happened.
      * 50/50 joint effort on revenue and effort to develop the ecosystem. Using AWS's knowledge in AI/ML for calculated sensors (slip, driver on seat, etc)
      * Usage by other vendors: A city can connect to the data from vehicles and detect when ice/slipping is happening. If brakes are getting overheated coming from a high elevation area. If a car had an accident, etc. An insurance company can provide an app to give discounts similar to the currently implemented OBD-2 readers. A maintenance provider can also connect to this data and check if an error is specific to maintenance, malpractice, or general misuse.
   * Spark: Endpoint management. Basically API security. Did not delve far into this, basic info.
      * Unified Endpoint Security: This is the endpoint where a laptop/phone/IoT device hits. It provides encryption and security around that. Continuous authentication is a part of it, where a device is learning the user behavior using ML and continuously checking if the behavior matches the original owner; if not, lock the device.
      * Unified Endpoint Management: Basically managing your API for devices.
      * Zero trust: I think this is specifically talking about continuous authentication. Basically, it's not an authenticate once and forget it. It's constantly tracking behavior to verify the user is the authenticated user.
   * AtHoc: Non-enterprise communication system.
      * Target customers: Government, healthcare, education, etc.
      * Solution: A communication system targeting non-enterprise businesses; specifically for Event management, cross organizational communication/collaboration, mass notifications.
      * Who does this benefit? You've seen the hacks in healthcare/educational/governmental sector. This is specifically for them.
   * SecuSUITE: Phone application to allow employees to use work related data in personal devices without cross communication (between personal and work data).
      * End to end encryption.
      * Separation of concerns between personal and work data. Employers CANNOT access your personal data.
      * Used by NATO; doesn't carry much value in my book but maybe in yours.
* Customer oriented solutions: As you've seen in the products above, some products overlap and are just names to target specific customers. It allows customers to easily understand what product could solve their issue. Continuous authentication is a great example of this: Their customer complained that they kept re-authenticating, so they designed a solution allowing them to authenticate once and using ML they learned their behavior and can continuously check if the user is the owner/authenticated user. This kind of passion in leadership is good for business.
* Liability: QNX has the highest security rating available. Most CEOs want to avoid liability when it comes to security, using QNX would help them avoid that in a similar way cloud services help them avoid being blamed for hacking.
* Leadership: BBs leadership isn't one to play on famous words to drive the stock up. John Chen explicitly states this in his interviews and says they are a security company. Not cyber, doesn't mention AI or whatever. He explicitly avoids meme words and understands what the point of BBs business is.

Where I think growth can be made:

1. QNX in more cars. They can capitalize on the idea of less ECUs = less cost for OEMs + security.
2. IVY usage by OEMs along with QNX.
3. IVY ecosystem. Maybe application billing?
4. Professional services (support) for the products listed.
5. AtHoc increased market share in more governmental/healthcare/educational entities.
6. SecuSUITE for more enterprise customers with the idea being saving employers money from purchasing work phones for employees, and worrying about securing them.

**Bear**:

* Revenue: It is not yet based on a subscription/usage basis. You can only produce so many cars, and they don't give an insight on how much do they charge per car for QNX. Anywhere from $2 - $20 is what was mentioned in transcripts. This is a growth area, but not at a trajectory that's excellent. IVY does work on a subscription/usage basis, but IVY can be used WITHOUT QNX. I'm worried about this, but still see it as an area that will generate revenue in the range of $400 MM - $600 MM at the price of $20 per 30M cars. The 30M per year is based on the listing of their customers and their yearly production rates. Keep in mind I stated any device, this does not include trucks or other IoT devices.
* Market share: These are relatively new products. J.P. Morgan pointed this out as a priority for growth. This could end up not working out and growth never happens. This is a relatively low risk due to QNX and IVY providing SO MUCH value for car manufacturers Vs. other products in the market.
* Patent revenue: They sold a chunk of their no longer relevant patents to Huawei. This makes up a small (<= 32%) of their revenue and is a one time sale. The coming quarter could be equal or less to the last quarter revenue due to either other sales making up the lost revenue from patents, or coming up short. It could come higher if they sold more services, but due to COVID and knowing that many car manufacturers have lowered their production due to chip shortage, the next quarter will most likely be lower.
* VW.os: VW is making their own OS. VW.os is what they're calling it. They're currently using QNX, but that revenue could potentially stop. Personally I don't believe VW is capable of doing that. It's a marketing hype. Their companies are not capable of good collaboration or good implementation based on what I've read and researched (can't find article right now), but it's something to be concerned about.
* QNX success: While IVY could be using QNX, it does NOT depend on it. There is potential for OEMs to use IVY without QNX. I think this is a low risk, but still risk. 19 OEMs are already using QNX.
* Lack of Answers: I can't get much out of their earnings call. They don't delve into pricing for QNX, how they plan to grow it besides getting more car manufacturers and more cars post Corona. How they plan to do recurring revenue. A breakdown of each revenue segment would be helpful, but I don't see that either and there is hesitancy to delve into it.

**Prediction**: I think QNX can become a $1B revenue per year alone. $2B revenue per year as a company is not far fetched. Without a subscription/usage based model, it is difficult to see how growth can go beyond that. BB is good in 2-5 years, not this year. I can see their revenue growing to potentially $2B - $4B revenue per year. They did mention trying to figure out a subscription/usage based billing, if done then the revenue would be much higher. I think $18 is a fair price on the high end. It could grow further than that, but expectations would be HIGH.

Here is a ranking guide to the different flavors of ramen to keep you until the next round of commissary or eviction notice comes in.

These ranks are subjective and personal opinion.

Not FINRA certified.

_____

Last Place (Tie): Less Sodium Variety.

https://imgur.com/a/02XF5uo

Better off just adding less sauce packet to your noodle soup. You want that MSG to trick your brain into thinking that **I ate a filling meal and I'm satisfied**. You don't go to the White Castle and order a chicken salad. You're eating ramen for dinner for the 6th time this week after blowing up your Robinhood account are you really worried about heart disease?

_____

Last Place (Tie): Chili

https://imgur.com/a/0FAbyEs

If you find this noodle soup spicy, stay away from Honey Nut Cheerios. If you go in expecting Hot Cheetos levels of addictive goodness, prepare to be sorely disappointed. The only thing burning will be your butthole after repeated abuse. What the fuck are they smoking in Irvine? Paprika doesn't make stuff spicy.

______

10: Roast Beef

https://imgur.com/a/bOPwlvJ

Nothing yells degenerate fuck like throwing some hotdogs into the roast beef ramen pretending that it's pieces of beef. It's as bland as it gets. The Monosodium Glutamate twerks on your taste buds like a Tik Tok Thot trying to make it on Onlyfans but somehow underperforms the classic regular beef flavor. Hard to find in a shelf because of Corona shortages but it's a far cry from a grail for ramenheads.

______

9: Creamy Chicken

https://imgur.com/a/ZkC9Ogf

If you enjoy alfredo and macaroni in cheese, this ramen comes in with a sledge hammer and says fuck your dreams. It tastes like Cheesasaurus Rex jizzed in your easy mac. Truly great if you're into that stuff. Your wife always knew in the back of her mind that Jason wasn't really your friend from College. Get back in there soldier.

______

8: Shrimp

https://imgur.com/a/LaMxxna

It tastes like your poor Japanese mom's coochie after a long shift at the swap meet. Artificial and yeasty, it's letting you know that you hit rock bottom. The minute you get a hint of depth with sesame oil, it drags you back in to remind that you're a crab in a bucket. Cup variety overperforms the package because it has real shrimp and vegetables.

_____

7: Pork

https://imgur.com/a/SildaAK

This Ramen tastes nothing like the real Tonkotsu ramen. It actually doesn't contain any pork or pork fat either. I don't know what you were expecting when you bought those TSLA 600 weekly puts. Did you think you'll be touring the rolling hills of Roppongi with your gains? Welcome to Gary, Indiana. Fuck you and enjoy your stay.

______

6: Picante Chicken

https://imgur.com/a/WgafcN6

Taste comes close to the classic chicken flavor. Throw some taco seasoning and a hint of hot sauce on the original chicken and you have your picante chicken ramen. This isn't too bad. When the margin calls come in, maybe you can live in Mexico. Can be quite nice with Tapatio and leftover rotisserie chicken if you weren't so poor.

_____

5: Beef

https://imgur.com/a/YYURI4f

A flavor so widespread that it's sold at Office Depot. The packaging taunts you with a piece of grilled sirloin and parsley leaves. You may get pieces of parsley depending on which region it was purchased. Not all ramen are created equal. What do you know, it actually tastes like beef broth. Solid option to last the nuclear winter.

______

4: Soy Sauce

https://imgur.com/a/QnVq7AA

Originally known as oriental before the name change, it is a workhorse ramen. It tastes like flavored soy sauce and some noodles. Throw in some fragrant vegetables like green onions and chives to take it to the next level. Being on welfare isn't so bad after all.

______

3: Chicken

https://imgur.com/a/AXHzrj0

Classic taste of College. How can you forget standing at the stove top smelling these cook at 3 in the morning. Salty chicken broth with savory undertones to help keep those Jaegerbombs down. Good times until you were kicked out for gambling your student loans. Turns out you can't declare bankruptcy on those. Papa Biden save me.

_____

2: Lime Chili Shrimp

https://imgur.com/a/05UOEPq

Guarantee your Mexican partners love these. You would too if you would expand your horizons. You invest in the same 125 tickers and look where they got you. Eating ramen noodles for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. If this is the case, try this one. Made in the San Antonio, TX factory for Maruchan, this thing delivers a kick with real habanero peppers. Slightly sour undertones of lime delivers a superb experience. You could even throw some grilled shrimps on top if those puts print. Maybe next tax year.

______

1: Roasted Chicken

https://imgur.com/a/LMRtrUO

You always wondered what tendies tastes like. Take that classic chicken flavor and add more depth. It is hard to find because of the pandemic but if your grocery store has these in stock, give this a go. This ramen is the grail. The soup is chicken broth mixed with, powdered cooked chicken, and chicken fat. Powdered turmeric, garlic, onions, and chives. It's an excellent snack even if you're not a bear struggling to make ends meet."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001715.csv|StockTicker|['A']|[]|['FINRA', 'MSG', 'I', 'J', 'AK', 'I', 'TSLA', 'A', 'AA', 'TX', 'UO']|['MSG', 'TSLA', 'AA', 'TX']

On the eve of this great day, I think it's important to say that it's always best to understate/undersell your winnings to friends and family. I, for instance, will only tell when asked, and then give a figure around 50/60% of the real figure.


**There are a multitude of reasons for doing this:**

1. People do not understand the hard work and risk you have taken for these gains, and so will expect them for free

2. Manipulative people will come out of the woodwork

3. You may have taxes yet to pay (I know it sucks)

4. You may lose all of this money yet (I am taking an investing break after this insane ride) 

5. The money is not a running tap, and is lump sums, so don't build a lifestyle around it 

6. Money is so much easier to spend than to make, please be sensible

That's all I have to say. Have a quiet cigar or champagne when you do cash out (above $1000 of course), or come up with some other excuse as to where the money came from.

On the eve of this lamentous day, I think it's important to say that it's always best to overstate/oversell your winnings to friends and family, I, for instance, always tell without asking, and then give a figure around 50/60% of the real figure after reversing the signs.

**There are a multitude of reasons for doing this:**

* People will otherwise, understand the little work and effort you have taken to lose your entire savings, bosses will expect you to start working wage-free

* You will need to go back into hiding from friends and family whom you've also ruined

* Can't pay taxes when you're dead (that's a plus)

* You can still gain it back buying the dip (I am taking out a loan on my wife's house and ring and going on an investment binge after boyfriend finishes her insane ride)

* The money was a running tap and your dumb ass blew it.

* Money is so much easier to make than spend so please be stoic

That's all I have to say. Have a quiet cry and jerk when you do cash out (below -$1000 of course), or come up with some other tale about how you totally sold at a vastly more opportune time than you really did.

Sup retards.

&#x200B;

I have seen a fuckload of people comparing the VW squeeze to the GME squeeze and heres why that is an absolutely retarded thing to do:

&#x200B;

**1) Time and Tech**

* I don't think this REALLY needs to be said, but the VW squeeze happened in 2008. GME squeeze is happening in 2021. There are some key differences here:
   * Quicker trades:  Back in 2008, online brokerages were really just beginning, with a low number of users. That means that things went quite a bit slower than they do now. Instead of months, this squeeze will take weeks.

**2) Players**

* **Retail was not significantly involved in the VW squeeze.** We are seeing massive swings in price because retail is involved, buying, and more importantly **selling** significantly. Also, retail trading of GME calls is leading to increased volatility that just wasn't there in the VW squeeze. **Therefore, comparing the chart of the VW squeeze to the GME chart is just retarded.**

**3) Ratio of shares sold short to available shares**

* **The GME squeeze CANNOT and WILL NOT be bigger than the VW squeeze for one reason: MATH.** In the VW squeeze, the ratio of Available shares to Short shares was 1:12. This means that for every share that was available to cover with, 12 were sold short. **This IS NOT, and NEVER HAS been the case with gamestop. At its peak, gamestop had a ratio of 1:2.56 of available float, and roughly 1:1.07 total float.**
   * Knowing this, mathematically the GME squeeze WILL NOT BE GREATER than the VW one. ~~we will likely see it top off at around 3-500 Maximum.~~
      * Yes, I know that the VW squeeze could've gone higher if it hadn't been for people helping them out of their short positions, but they were in an entirely different situation with a ratio of 1:12 than any of the shorts are with a ratio of 1:2.56 (maximum)

I could go more in depth with this, but I'm not going to. hopefully you guys can understand it.

**TL:DR: GME squeeze IS NOT the VW squeeze and they really** ***CANNOT BE COMPARED ON ANY INTELLECTUALLY HONEST MERIT.***

Comparing the two charts ""guys we are just in the dip, HOLD!!!11!"" is **PURELY CONFIRMATION BIAS and should be taken with a grain of salt.**

&#x200B;

edit: there has been a lot of great discussion in this thread and there is something i'd like to address:

This situation is completely new: we have so many other variables that have never been seen in the market driving this crazy rocket ship, and there is no way to accurately predict a top, bottom, etc on this. Because of this, I have edited out my ""estimation"" of a top, because I think that there is really no way for me to accurately find that number for you guys, and dont want to be misleading. 

Though I tried to use previous short squeezes in history to predict the top by adjusting variables, there is really no way for me to accurately do this, I realize it all comes down to estimation and speculation, and it would be dishonest for me to assert a top without knowing any of this for sure. 

That being said, still dont compare these two squeezes (especially the chart for fucks sake) , and GME üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ"|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001727.csv|StockTicker|['GME', 'VW']|['GME']|['I', 'I', 'VW', 'GME', 'I', 'EALLY', 'VW', 'GME', 'VW', 'GME', 'VW', 'VW', 'GME', 'GME', 'ANNOT', 'WILL', 'NOT', 'VW', 'MATH', 'VW', 'IS', 'NOT', 'NEVER', 'HAS', 'GME', 'WILL', 'NOT', 'BE', 'EATER', 'VW', 'I', 'VW', 'I', 'GME', 'IS', 'NOT', 'VW', 'ANNOT', 'BE', 'PARED', 'ON', 'ANY', 'UALLY', 'ONEST', 'MERIT', 'HOLD', 'URELY', 'ATION', 'BIAS', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Now, I know past success is not an indicator of future success, but I have found a company that I believe will be an even better opportunity than GME was in the coming months.

What if I told you that there was a streaming company that is like ROKU before it ran up?

How about a lesser known sports betting company which can run up like DKNG or PENN?

For everyone else, what if there was a company with insane short interest like GME, which unlike GME, has not even begun to squeeze?

  
**What if these were all the same company, ready to run up massively?**

  
This company is FUBO, or fuboTV. Let‚Äôs go over the reasons why.

&#x200B;

**1: Cutting the Cable**

More than 60% of people in the US still have a cable subscription. Why don‚Äôt people just use Netflix, Amazon Video, or something like that? The answer is that they want live TV. This created a demand for streaming services such as Youtube TV, which are cheaper and better than cable. Among these, fuboTV has the distinction of providing the best channel/price ratio, 113 channels for $65 a month. Don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good price? Well, their customers do, at least. FuboTV‚Äôs paid subscriber count, revenue per user, and hours watched increased dramatically in Q3, by 58%, 14%, and 83% respectively. Total revenue rose by 71% that quarter. In addition, Fubo just increased their Q4 guidance, saying they expect $94-98 million in revenue this quarter instead of the prior $80-85 million. They also expect paid subscribers to reach 545,000 at the end of the year, instead of the prior guidance of 500k-510k. Also, they expect to increase the amount of money they make from advertising.

**2: Sports Betting Fever**

Sports betting is becoming legal in more states than ever before, and the industry is projected to reach $155 billion by 2024. Companies like DKNG and PENN have already capitalized on this growth, and FUBO also wants in. FuboTV is no stranger to sports: they started out as a company mainly focused on sports streaming, and they cover many sports games that other services miss out on. FuboTV recently completed two acquisitions of sports betting companies, Balto Sports and Vigtory. They plan to create an integrated sports betting environment where their sports fans can watch games live and bet on them. Through Vigtory, they already have a deal for legal sports betting in Iowa and are in talks with other Eastern U.S. states to begin operations there.

**3: Actual GOOD Analyst Coverage and Price Targets**

Now, I know what you‚Äôre thinking. Analysts are monkeys that set arbitrary targets for stocks and often make worse recommendations than if you just picked stocks randomly. However, some have results that speak for themselves. FUBO was recommended by Luke Lango, the #1 financial blogger on TipRanks. He has an average success rate of 84%, or 420/499 stock ratings, and an average return of 60.3% per rating. Compared to the average analysts which boomers call ‚Äúgood‚Äù getting an average success rate of \~60%, this man is a genius. Luke thinks FUBO can tap into the live TV market and grow by 2000% over the next 10 years, or about 35% each year. But whether you believe in his recommendation or not, boomers love price targets and worship analysts. When they see the stock hitting the price target, they will get on board. And the analyst consensus price for FUBO right now is 43.50. Just above where we are today.

**4: SHORT SQUEEZE!!! üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

For all of you who can barely read and are just looking for the next GME, this is the place for you. If somehow you can tell what this is saying, FUBO last checked in with a short interest of 65% as of December 31. Two üåàüêª firms decided to short the stock and spread FUD about them not being able to make profit or succeed in sports betting, advertising, or subscription revenue when they saw it had run up. Well guess what, they are already showing growth in subscribing user growth, completing sports betting acquisitions, and the rest is soon to follow. FUBO is way down from the high of $60 and is just looking to run with a positive catalyst. FUBO üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

**Positions: FUBO $50C 3/5, $50C 5/21.**

But keep this in mind, even though GME hit something stupid like 150, that it's as of now still +20% from Friday is a remarkable feat. It means that buyers still outweigh sellers. 

For all you longs out there, here's something to be hopeful about: 

[Don't worry about the lines. They don't matter right now. And I'm not deleting them, because I'm interested in them. ](https://preview.redd.it/l6onj5wt7jd61.png?width=2840&format=png&auto=webp&s=710f52f7d87f86ccd74449f72fcbac2fb6cff483)

GME filled its gap TODAY. I'm under the full belief that massive gap-ups are always retraced. If it didn't retrace today, it would have collapsed tomorrow or next week, which could have easily marked a top for shorts. EVEN IF GME CLOSED 5% UP FROM FRIDAY, THAT IS STILL A STRONG SIGN.

Nokia recently renewed their 5-year contract with T-Mobile

## T-Mobile awards Nokia with five-year deal

T-Mobile awarded five-year deals to both Ericsson and Nokia for the continued rollout of its 5G network, but didn‚Äôt specify how much the deals are worth other than to say they‚Äôre ‚Äúmulti-billion-dollar‚Äù agreements.

T-Mobile last year closed its merger with Sprint, which also used Samsung network gear, but it doesn‚Äôt appear that work is carrying over to the newly combined T-Mobile.

‚ÄúT-Mobile already has the largest 5G network in the country,‚Äù said T-Mobile President of Technology Neville Ray in a statement. ‚ÄúThese agreements with our longstanding 5G partners Nokia and Ericsson will help us take our 5G leadership even further, delivering ever-better experiences for our customers for years to come.‚Äù

[According to Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/14/nokia-supports-t-mobile-5g-evolution-with-five-year-expansion-deal/), it will continue to expand T-Mobile‚Äôs Extended Range (low-band) 5G coverage while also supplying macro and small cells across T-Mobile‚Äôs low, mid-band and millimeter wave spectrum, in addition to Massive MIMO in the 2.5 GHz band.

Nokia said the outlook it provided last fall included the expected impact of this deal with T-Mobile, so it doesn‚Äôt change that guidance.

Nokia in particular can use some good news in the network supply arena. Last fall, Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark warned of expected financial challenges in 2021 and indicated plans to invest heavily in 5G. It‚Äôs been widely speculated that Nokia lost a $6.6 billion 5G contract with Verizon last year when the U.S. carrier instead¬†[chose Samsung](https://www.fiercewireless.com/financial/samsung-scores-6b-network-deal-verizon).

# Why I think this stock has the potential to run

In 2020 NASA awarded Nokia (NOK) first mobile cellular network on the moon. Stocks pertaining to the Space economy are a new emerging sector right now. You're seeing all these Space ETFS coming into the market. This new emerging space economy is worth around $2 trillion. Now, you probably know what I'm going to say next in case you don't let me tell you!

The new CEO has been recently aiming focus on 5G, 5G will be needed to aid self driving cars etc. But one thing that's bigger than that is being able to connect to the internet any where in the world, perhaps via satellite in space. As a company, this could open a variety of new opportunities for NOK in this emerging $2 trillion space economy.

Why can't Melvin capital just uninstall the Robinhood app and reinstall it to restore their save game and get their money back?????

Reading between the lines, I think Melvin got a margin call that would have wiped out the hedge fund. That would have caused Citadel and Point72 to have a portion of their portion go to $0 which would have hurt their returns. They decided to pump more money into it to prevent bankruptcy. 

Sounds like these hedge funds are vultures coming in to feast on the carcass.

Who is going to bailout Citadel and Point72 when they get squeezed too?

**Citadel LLC and Point72 Asset Management are investing $2.75 billion into hedge fund Melvin Capital Management, which has been hard hit by a series of short bets to start the year.**

The influx of cash is expected to help stabilize Melvin, which has lost 30% for the year through Friday, said people familiar with the firm. Melvin started the year with $12.5 billion and had been one of the best performing hedge funds on Wall Street in recent years. The losses stem from Melvin‚Äôs array of short-bets against companies and have stunned clients and other traders.

Citadel and its partners are investing $2 billion and Point72, which already had more than $1 billion invested in Melvin as of 2019, $750 million. The investments are for non-controlling revenue shares in the hedge fund. Melvin founder Gabe Plotkin was a top portfolio manager at Point72‚Äôs predecessor firm, SAC Capital Management before he left to start Melvin.


It couldn‚Äôt be determined how much of a revenue share Citadel and Point72 would get.

This is why Nokia will boom in 2021. Like $BB, it is no longer a phone company, but is now a major contender in 5G, autonomous driving, AI tech and cyber security. In fact, it almost sounds like a better blackberry with more upside potential. $NOK is trading at $4.75 at the time of writing. It saw a steady decline since it's previous high of $5 in August of 2020, but has since recovered in the last 4 months. 

The reason for the initial selloff was a corporate decision to cut jobs to free up cashflow for large projects going forward. At this time they also halted dividends which pissed off some older retirees, as expected. Now here is the various reason this stock can deliver massive returns in the next 12-36 months.

**Selected for U.S. Federal 5G Security Project**

The project is to ensure a secure transition from 4G to 5G because of the various risks perceived by the general public, to whom security comes above all else. Nokia will provide both software and hardware solutions, and work with both NCCoE and Government to implement.

**Nokia wins Belgian 5G contracts as Huawei ousted**

To put it short, Nokia was chosen to implement 5G technology in Belgium as US continued to put pressure on literally everyone to end business with Huawei over potential security threats.

**5 Year Deal with T-Mobile**

T-Mobile will be using Nokia's Airscale Radio Platform to scale up 5G deployment. As well as this, Nokia will personally facilitate T-Mobiles upgrade from LTE to 5G, which is by all means a large project

**Partnership with Google Cloud**

Googles cloud computing services will be working together with Nokia to help businesses transform their network connectivity through the implementation of 5G and new cloud capabilities.

**Contract Secured with Tele2 in Sweden**

The amount has not been disclosed but it involves deploying 5G infrastructure for Tele2 subscribers in Sweden, to improve network performance and security. They will also use Nokia's NetAct Cloud Management system to improve management and security of sensitive subscriber data.

**Partnership with M1 to build Singapore 5G Ecosystem**

Together with M1, Nokia will implement their 5G standalone core to deliver advanced network capabilities to Singapore. The 5G Standalone core tech allows operators to design and automate network slices to further development of unmanned aerial or road vehicles, remote operations, wireless e-health, etc...

TL:DR

Nokia is not a phone Company. Major contender in the 5G space, cybersecurity AND AI autonomous vehicle operation. Partnerships with other large companies in both the US and abroad have set the stage for NOKIA to dominate 5G, which has the potential to see more growth than any other industry in 2021. Also have more upside potential as Huawei continues to lose contracts due to US pressure and potential security threats.

SPY violent drop halted the bullish momentum. Short attack at noon failed to reverse sentiment. Expect more volatility during the week. This is my own interpretation of the price action today and is not financial advice. Honestly, I'm a moron with an IQ below 69. I don't have a PT. I let the market tell me that.

&#x200B;

[1min intraday chart of GME \(candles\) and SPY \(blue line\)](https://preview.redd.it/8osyp4jqdjd61.png?width=2433&format=png&auto=webp&s=49125a85d34b59adcd3376812a22ddd25b5cbbb9)

&#x200B;

Very strong pre-market activity opening with a 2.5M shares sold to force price below 95.  [Read this post to understand why this 95 level matters. Absolutely on point during today's action.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4207e/gme_options_pricing_expected_and_max_volatility/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) MM needed to defend this price level or hedge above it. At this point in time, for 1/29, there were 25.000 puts ITM and +25.000 calls OTM between 95 - 115. Once the 95 level broke, it was a gamma event like last friday only this time, price shoot-up above the highest strike and all the way to $160. Notice the deceleration after 115 (highest strike) which could mean that MM were completing their hedges. After, I believe we started seeing short covering and margin calls. 22M shares traded hands within 20 minutes as price shoots from 115 to 160 and with $10 dollar bid-ask spreads.   


But then, trading halted and SPY took a violent dive bringing down all equities across the board. Algo trading kicked-in and GME lost 50% in less than 30min. However, unlike the previous increase, less than 10M shares traded hands in that period. Notice how OBV reacted with both moves.

The MM gamma event lost momentum and at exactly noon, when liquidity tends to dry, a big short attack to drive price down to the previous open, only to be countered by some big money purchases to where it currently stands (and likely will close).

&#x200B;

My take on all this is that the tape is showing accumulation at current prices. OI in OTM calls and puts is now close to 200.000 contracts (say actually 15M shares - or half the current float to hedge) for 1/29 alone. Gamma events are not over and if today is any indication, it seems like MMs are more active hedging then last week. With a gap-up at open it should be similar price action.

**4:00 AM**

Light skirmishes started early with retards from the 136th Armored Idiots surprising the enemy and taking substantial ground out of the gate. Caught off guard, the enemy was driven back on their heels. The boost in morale was immediate and would reverberate through the rest of the bloody day.

**5:00 AM**

The enemy awoke to chaos and confusion, but managed a minor rally, driving the 136th back into the arms of the 103rd Sleepy Retards. They would go on to put up a valiant fight and suffer many casualties in the coming hours. The fighting was sporadic but intense at times.

**6:00 AM - 9:30 AM**

Skirmishes continued between the lines of the 90th Diamond Dildos and 103rd. Battle lines were drawn and troop positions massed in these key early hours. The skirmishing saw gains come and go and would telegraph the bloody day to come.

**9:30 AM - 11:30 AM**

In an explosive maneuver, general [u/deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue/) assembled and unleased the full might of the 159th Weaponized Autists. The fighting was sustained, intense, and bloody. The 159th gained ground at an alarming rate and it appeared as if total capitulation of the enemy was imminent. Troops that managed to penetrate deep into enemy territory reported seeing the enemy General Left stuff mouthfuls of crayons into his face and shit waxy rainbows.

**11:30 AM - 1:00 PM**

We underestimated the resolve of the enemy. A flanking move by General Melvin took the 159th in the rear and scattered our troops. The fear caused a substantial complement of our soldiers to desert and run for the hills on the spot. I have not words for these cowards. At the same time, I saw good men - nay, great men - of the 159th, 150th, 140th, 130th, 120th, 110th, 100th, 90th, and 80th cut down en-masse. I will not speak further of this here other than to say that they will be avenged and see their names carved into the stones of Valhalla itself.

**1:00 PM - 4:00 PM**

I can only note here the deep pride I feel in my men and in my cause. I am not an emotional man, but what I saw with mine own eyes today would evoke emotion in the stoniest of hearts. After what appeared to be a stunning reversal and brief loss of ground, my men dug in their heels and fought like legends out of my childhood stories. Ground was given and taken over the next few hours, but at the end of the day, the enemy was driven back. My heart is filled with pride and hope for the future.

This day will not be forgotten.

Shorts recognize that we're almost all into our positions now. The outstanding float that isn't held by us is in their possession minus a few defectors on our side and 5-10% held by others. They are going to do EVERYTHING in their power to bring this down. ""Like what?"" you may ask...

1. Bot brigade negative sentiment on social media, reddit, etc. (this has yet to be common and could be more prevalent soon - though I have seen some new made accounts posting negative sentiment on GME)

1. Buying up the shares we don't have, driving up the price... 

 a) Hoping to create more liquidity for them by reducing our shares (more defectors as price goes up). 

 b) So they can accumulate shares and manufacture large sell offs on volume to create what we saw earlier today

1. Persuade investors on reddit, social media, etc. that there are other better things to buy that will fuck shorts. Yes, there are plenty. But they want to spread us thin. BB, AMC, etc. are just the beginning. If we sell some of our shares to allocate to these and more that will be mentioned over the next couple weeks, we will lose. We will lose not only our strength in GME, but our strength in any focus of any short squeeze.

This is a war. We won the first battle and now they know we mean business. But we haven't won the war. They are going to pull shit that we won't see coming. We will be tested and this will not be easy. But we need to understand that if we persevere through this, we will not only come out rich for our early endeavors (because it's still early in this squeeze) but we will have power in bringing about actual change in the way large funds manipulate prices and how they manage risk. It sounds cliche, but this literally is the turning point. This is where we make history.

From the dizzying highs to soul-crushing lows. I even bought a bit more at the midpoint prices of today. From my observations, this is how the institutions conspired to crush the longs in order to give the shorts breathing room to cover.

1. The beginning of the day was intentional. They let fomo run GME all the way into the sky with almost no resistance whatsoever.

2. However, at around 10-10:30 AM EST, something odd happened. The brokers suddenly jacked up their margin requirements for GME. My portfolio previously had a lot of buying power, which suddenly disappeared.

3. We were intentionally allowed to break 150 (which is the highest option strike available) in order to make everyone fomo even harder. Then, the dump came, and it was vicious. At the same time, CNBC started an hour-long segment bashing GME nonstop. Only Cramer provided a bit of token resistance. Every other analyst was calling this move unwarranted and warning that tons of people will be bagholding.

4. As a result, everyone who chased in on margin got fucked. Even my sizeable portfolio was margin called. Fortunately, while I'm retarded, I'm not the most retarded and was not all in GME and was using only a little margin. I was able to cover easily. The unfortunate morons who fomo'd in on margin above today's open were not so lucky. I imagine a lot of retards got liquidated on the way down.

5. The cascading effect let us fill the gap completely and even a little past. However, the important point is that we closed above Friday's close at +18% for the day. I see this as very bullish. So keep holding and don't fucking sell into the fear the other side tried to create. Going forward, stop buying GME on heavy margin. Use cash accounts if possible. Don't let yourself be set up as a domino piece for the shorts to knock over into everyone else.

**TLDR: MMers, brokers, and shorts conspired to screw us. They let us run price up, then jacked up margin requirements, and finally dumped.

We all know the story of $GME and the very real possibility of a substantial short squeeze, the likes of which we have never seen before.  Predictably, retail investors, with a laser focus on /r/WSB, are taking the blame.  CNBC can‚Äôt stop talking about how /r/WSB is ‚Äúcausing‚Äù the short squeeze, trying to characterize a community of random, anonymous, degenerate primates with a legally cognizable entity that can be regulated.  The narrative so far has been that the short squeeze in $GME will cause market-wide sell offs, as we saw this morning when the stock price hit $150.  (They want you to ignore that the market recovered and $GME went from red to up ~20% into close without negative impact to the market at large.)

The facts here are clear.  Shorting GME has been free money for awhile now, but the shorts got greedy and got caught with their pants down.  It is unquestionable that if someone is to ‚Äúblame‚Äù for the short squeeze, should it occur, the blame is solely on the shorts for putting themselves in such an incredibly risky position‚Äîafter all, don‚Äôt they say to ‚Äúinvest at your own risk‚Äù?  Also, no one here in WSB is rich enough to be buying $GME at $100 per share in the thousands.  The other hedge funds smell blood in the water and are eliminating their competition. 

It is also clear that the shorts are bleeding. (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4wh03/we_fucking_did_it_bois/)  

They are going to get desperate. It seems likely that they will infiltrate our freedom of speech haven in order to spread misinformation about $GME. 

First, in the beginning I was concerned about the risk of the company doing an offering and diluting ownership.  However, as I looked into it more, I discovered that even if $GME does an offering, it would be limited to $100M, which is miniscule in relation to GME‚Äôs fair market cap. (See, e.g., https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4coy2/how_likely_is_a_gme_offering/). In other words, if you see headlines or posts talking about a GME offering, they can be ignored as inconsequential.
Second, if you did your research, you will find a bullish PT of $169 as set by GMEDD.com et al. (see https://www.gmedd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GMEdd-GameStopValuation-20Jan21.pdf)   However, you need to bear in mind that the same report set a base PT of $80, which is where we are right about now.  The shorts aren‚Äôt donkey brained, so they will send their peons to infiltrate /r/WSB to try convince people that the ‚Äúbig dogs‚Äù in the GME short play are getting out at this price target and that you will end up being the bag holder.  **THIS IS ALL BULLSHIT THAT SHOULD BE IGNORED** Although I respect the team at gmedd, we all know that a conservative bullish price target is $420.69, and no one with half a brain should consider selling any sooner.

See one (of many) legitimate posts that was removed below.  
I have multiple screen names FYI.[https://imgur.com/a/kWS86RC](https://imgur.com/a/kWS86RC)

This is not the first time I've had >50K YOLOS and gain/loss porn removed.  
I believe my posts are the epitome of what WSBers are looking for.  
FD YOLOs, GAIN/LOSS, DD (most of my solid DD has been removed).  
My posts are also all legitimate with clear images of my position and cost basis.

Messaging the mods only yields sarcastic dumbass remarks.  
It's ironic how the mods act like they're trying to protect the sub, yet they're manipulating their own stocks by allowing/disallowing posts at will.

The mods embody the very things we retailers are fighting against.  
Now, they're no better than Citron Research.

I've said this before and I'll say it again.  
The spirit of this sub is getting killed.

The mods are self serving pieces of shit and I caution any of you members to realize what is going on and act accordingly.

I'm sure this post will either get removed, or some dumbass mod will count how many posts have been removed on just this user name and try to call me out as overtly sensitive for only a few posts.  
This has been going one for a while, although not to the same extent or degree as of late.

Either way, It's been fun everyone; take care and good luck.  
Don't let these jackasses pull the rug out from under your feet.

EDIT, there seems to be a lot of retards with zero reading comprehension.  
Here's a response from ZJZ the last time I inquired about a large yolo post getting removed.

https://preview.redd.it/982au9eqjkd61.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cadf269d0a2f9795ab00e6125fc37a6f482096

The other mod ( I can't find the message or remember his name) simply told me my ticker was gay (another near 6 figure FD YOLO).

As you can see, this was 5 months ago and it has been going on for a while.  
Keep sucking off the mods you bottom feeding donkeys, you deserve to be here and lose your money.  


EDIT 2, I literally posted another YOLO under this username 3 days ago. Once again, zjz claims his lies and the sheeple believe everything he says.  
He likes to deflect and blame it on something else, such as the case of auto mod the last time someone called him out.

I'm just a dumbass with some life experience to share.

**First, buy some goddamn personal umbrella insurance.** It's cheap af, like I pay $400 a year for mine. And it's easy af to buy. What is umbrella insurance? It's something poor people will never have to worry about, so be glad it's in your life now. **It protects you from lawsuits by parasites by adding million(s) of dollars in personal liability coverage above and beyond the policy limits of your auto, renters or homeowners insurance.**

Your shitty auto/renter/homeowners policies have limits of a couple hundred thousand bucks max. If you hit somebody's car, if someone slips and falls in your house, if someone accuses you of sexual assault, odds are there they will want to sue you. Any plaintiff's attorney worth half a fuck that they hire is going to do their research on you and when they do their DD and find out you have tons of assets now, they are going to come after way more than what they wanted thinking you were just some broke nobody. Umbrella insurance protects you from the unlikely but ever present threat of bankruptcy through lawsuits now that you are rich target. I've seen way too many idiot doctors and successful small business owners lose their life's work through negligence lawsuits and not having umbrella policies in place that would have stopped it.

Which brings me to my second request of you. Don't make yourself an obvious target. **Keep your goddamn mouth shut about your tendies and tell no one the particulars. Don't even fucking hint at it.** Don't tell dad to make him proud, don't tell strangers to impress them and feel good, don't tell some girl to get her to fuck you. I don't care if you shower the people you love with gifts, it's none of my business. If they ask, just say you had a good year trading and leave it at that.

Neither of my parents know about my trading profits, nor that I'm a millionaire. None of my friends know. I'll go to my grave not telling a soul. Because I see how people treat the people I know IRL who do flaunt it and I'm disgusted how some people (not all) no longer view you as a person, just something to exploit. 

**Why tf should you listen to me? Maybe you shouldn't. I was wrong af about GME.** I posted how I thought it was trash from $10 to $30 and while I thought u/DeepFuckingValue deserved props for eating shit all year and holding strong, I thought the rest of you were FOMO sheep chasing it in the $20s. Mea culpa. I'm glad I was wrong. I've never seen so many rattled old white men before in my life before this week and it's great. I'm genuinely happy for you guys that hit it big and hope the squeeze isn't over. Please consider what I've said.

This is an extension of my DD series on GME. If you haven‚Äôt read them and have time, they will provide some background on my previous predictions, some of which have already come true.

* [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) covered Cohen, fair market cap analysis, and potential investors, in which I talked about the amazing mid-to-long term potential for GME.
* After the Citron tweet, I shared this [fan fiction on what looked like blatant market manipulation by shorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) on the day of the tweet, and offered some education on strengthening your position. This one got buried and is worth reading.

# What‚Äôs happened thus far

## Why did GME go up on Friday?

The story here is more complex than paid media articles would like you to believe. GME has been driven up by 3 different forces:

* Organic buying
   * There is a mixture of growing positive sentiment in the investor world (not just WSB) about GME‚Äôs future
   * There‚Äôs been a lot of good due diligence shared not just on WSB but even outside (for example, see gmedd.com)
   * The Citron Backfire
      * Shorts were on the ropes and kept looking for hail mary‚Äôs. They went to Citron and [coordinated a dump](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) to try to bring the price down.
      * However, this backfired. Citron is so disliked in the industry that new wealth poured into GME in the face of Andrew Left‚Äôs pleas. Even when Benzinga brought Andrew Left on air, **minutes after he left** [they bought shares live on their show](https://youtu.be/mFiFWBrE5DE?t=5104)**.**
      * The next day, our very on u/Uberkikz11 [was on Benzinga](https://youtu.be/GLzTU87MJMM?t=837) and more shares were bought.
   * Larger investors piling in
      * In my [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/), I hypothesized that we‚Äôd soon see larger investors pile in. Then, on WSB, we saw posts from a [venture capitalist](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/) as well as a [hedge fund investor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/)
* Gamma squeeze
   * Once the organic buying started, we rolled into a gamma squeeze. Many people written about the gamma squeeze so I won‚Äôt repeat, see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/) for an example.
* Ultra low liquidity - In EndGame part 1, I talked about how the actual actively traded shares are much lower than the reported float, and **share availability has been reducing** driven by lots of diamond hands, not just among smaller guys like us but the larger folks too.
* I believe there were some short covers on Friday, but Ortex was still estimating 71M shares short at the eod.

However, not many people have talked about why it **went down**

## Why did GME come down?

Here‚Äôs where things got interesting for me, and something I think happened again today (Monday) when GME climbed up over 100% but then had a rapid reversal, closing 20% above yesterday but closing below open.

So Friday looked like a slam dunk - gamma squeeze, no shorts available to short, puts were getting exceedingly expensive as a short tactic. What happened?

This is my fan fiction, based on what I saw.

**I believe** [**market-makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) **took a non-neutral stance and began actively shorting the stock after the second halt.**

Market-makers are responsible for maintaining liquidity and functioning in the stock market, but they also have abilities that others don‚Äôt - for example they are legally allowed to naked short for ‚Äúliquidity purposes‚Äù. They also have the ability to halt trading.

There were two halts in the day on Friday: First, when GME was up 69% (heh heh), and then a few minutes later when it kept climbing after the first halt was relaxed. Note that at the time of the first halt, the **bid-ask spread was $10 on the underlying** a huge signal that there just were not enough shares to buy.

However, after the second halt, something strange happened. Whereas a few minutes prior, there were no sellers willing to sell their shares below $75, **within 15 minutes** after the halt there were sellers at 70, 65, 60, and 56. Where did these sellers come from?

&#x200B;

[Incredible momentum reversal on Friday 1\/22 to push the price not too far above the 60c strike price. ](https://preview.redd.it/tt5zodp6pkd61.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa22980543213227bf5b3d17166129ac6cb65a65)

My speculation? This was a coordinated **naked short ladder attack**. In this type of attack, short seller A sells to short seller B, who then turns around to short seller A at a lower price, etc. and with a **very small amount of capital** you can wreck the momentum of a stock and make people think that others are running for the exits.

Notice how the stock dropped from a high of $75 on Friday to below 60 - the highest expiring SP for the 1/22 options, and stayed tight in range for the rest of the day. Now, for compliance reasons, MM are required to be neutral by EOD, so 20 minutes before close, MMs had to buy back all their short positions, which led to the strong close above 60.

All this led me to believe that the **real fair market price for GME was above $65.** Without the market makers interference, GME would have closed higher.

## A repeat on Monday

The short ladder attack repeated on Monday.

GME opened strong above $90, and quickly climbed to **a high above $155** before it was halted, immediately after the halt, a **short ladder attack again** drove the price down

&#x200B;

[Dejavu - Incredible Momentum Reversal after trading halts. ](https://preview.redd.it/qm81rd0dpkd61.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b4563e7dd2e626fb09dca69668c24631932e707)

Both days, there **were rapid and significant reversals in momentum.**

Now, I kept wondering - why would MM‚Äôs take the side of the shorts? What‚Äôs in it for them? One theory was that they were not adequately hedged, with the low liquidity of the stock meaning that the price was moving up too fast for them to acquire the shares they needed to.

But then the news hit today:

# A new opponent enters the ring:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8htb0scgpkd61.png?width=926&format=png&auto=webp&s=228a8a84e592ea4642a61c5e07e07ae344ac8f2c

That‚Äôs right, the **same Citadel** [**listed by the NYSE as one of their designated market makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) is now invested in Melvin‚Äôs hedge fund and has a financial interest in the direction of GME‚Äôs share price.

**Hey media - you want a manipulation story? You‚Äôre missing the big one.**

# Now what?

Shorts have pulled new dirty tactics each time they‚Äôve been pushed to the edge. Paid media attacks, Citron‚Äôs fluff tweet + coordinated shorting, and now they‚Äôve got the **actual people who get all the order flow on their side.**

On the other hand, GME is still up over 20% and now trading at $88.00 after hours, which is well above the previous day‚Äôs high.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rr5qet4ipkd61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=96d28bf446a714906712503726f5903a681d5368

What this tells me is that GME‚Äôs **true price is still being suppressed**. They are using every tactic possible, even changing the [bid-ask spread rules](https://thefly.com/permalinks/entry.php/id3233043/GME;IRBT-NYSE-changes-bidask-differentials-on-options-for-GameStop-iRobot) on options to specifically target retail‚Äôs buying of options.

We‚Äôre now playing the game against the folks who write the rules of the game.

Some shorts may have covered today - with prices below $60 at one point they had some great opportunities to. However, there is **no way all of the shorts who need to exit covered today.**

The short position still lost 20% from yesterday. They‚Äôve got more fingers in the dam, but it‚Äôs definitely cracking. Also, **every call option purchased prior to 1/25 is ITM and profitable,** while **every put option purchased prior to 1/25 is OTM.**

And, for some reason, the SEC still doesn‚Äôt want to enforce the threshold securities list for GME, where it‚Äôs now **been on for more than 30 days in a highly covered ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rbrf6khjpkd61.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e4f432ff02dbf475a03cc68c54a5a0f5f0de429

# Margin impacts:

Note that at this point, most brokers have increased margin on GME. This means that people that are long or short on margin will need to put up capital to hold their positions.

This also means **puts will get more expensive** as people who sell puts will have to maintain 100% of the notional in their accounts to secure the put, so MMs will have fewer retail sellers of puts to absorb the demand.

That means it‚Äôs not a bad idea to sell puts to acquire shares if you‚Äôre aiming for the long-term and not the squeeze, but keep in mind you‚Äôll need the exact same capital as if you‚Äôd bought the shares, so it‚Äôs up to you on this.

For shorts, a margin increase while the price is moving against you (even with retracements) is no good.

# My speculation

* Cohen and the GME board have been strangely silent this entire run. It‚Äôs possible they can‚Äôt say anything at all during the pre-earnings quiet period, but I‚Äôm sure they can see what‚Äôs happening.
* MMs will continue to play dirty, but at the same time they will need to continue to need to buy GME shares to delta hedge 1/29 and later ITM options as we get closer to expiry.

# Things to be careful about

As you can see, this is no easy win. I've been in GME for a few months but I've seen almost every trick in the book. In addition to the [suggestions I wrote about in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/), here‚Äôs some things to be careful about.

* **Be careful about swapping ITM calls for OTM calls:** it can be tempting to trade-up your options for higher return, but be mindful of the delta impact. You may actually be driving the sale of shares by MMs when you don‚Äôt mean to. For example, if you sell a .5 delta call for 2 .2 delta calls, that‚Äôs net reduction of 10 shares that MMs have to hold long as leverage.
* **Be careful about being short any calls this week:** Not only do you limit your upside (which is dumb in the prospect of a squeeze), you could end up in a nightmare scenario. A call that ends OTM on Friday could end up ITM after hours if you didn‚Äôt sell it, and you may get assigned while the underlying continues to go up.
* **There are a few other dirty tactics shorts can play.** I‚Äôm not specifically going to share them here because I don‚Äôt want to give the ideas circulation, but
   * **Choose your own limit sells based on personal sell points.** Don‚Äôt copy others and don‚Äôt try to be memey. Make your own decisions.
   * **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it‚Äôs an **attack vector** for you.
* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn‚Äôt resume for the rest of the day? **All your 1/29 calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you‚Äôre taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration.
* **Be careful about buying on margin.** Brokers are rapidly increasing margins. If you bought on margin with 2:1 leverage, and the stock went up 100%, you‚Äôd be in margin call even without a margin change. If the broker moves margin against you, you‚Äôll get to margin call faster.
* **Don‚Äôt bet more than you can afford to lose.** I‚Äôve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing (remember last Monday with the short sale restriction?), you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I‚Äôve held through multiple 30-40% drawdowns in the underlying; and **held through a 50% drawdown today**, so you need to be ready for the volatility.
* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It‚Äôs common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you‚Äôve set a stop loss, be really sure about it.

This is not financial advice; do your own DD. I‚Äôm holding over $1M in shares and calls.

# 1/26 Update

Hi everyone. Sorry for not posting or replying to comments. I was auto-banned from WSB when this post was auto-deleted by the auto-mod. Thanks to u/zjz to reversing the auto-deletion of the post though as it looked like it was helpful to the community.  

Hope you all made a ton of money today!

**Quick Notes:**

* At an after-hours price of **$209 a share**, **every call option, for every expiry, for every strike price is in-the-money. This is the third time this has happened for GME recently.** Amazing. What this means now is that market makers will need to buy a lot of shares to hedge for the calls expiring this week. Heed my above warnings. 
* At this price, shorts **will start to get liquidated.** Combining the 400% weekly gain with the margin requirements increasing across the board, brokers will force close short positions. Starting maybe with the small guys, but it will cause a ripple effect. **Things could move fast.** Some funds may get additional bailouts this week to hold out. 
* **You need to decide your own exit.** Only you know how much $ you're playing with, how much you're willing to lose, how important the $ is to you, etc. **Minimize you're regret, don't maximize your profits.** If you are thinking about taking profits this week, spread out your sells so you don't kick yourself over timing things poorly. Personally, I think we are in **unprecedented territory** and that there's no way all of the shorts have exited already, so we're not done. I could be wrong. See EndGame part 1. 
* **Close spreads.** With every call ITM, you are at the risk of early-assignment. If you don't watch closely, you could be hit with sky-high hard-to-borrow fees and get killed on what you thought was a profitable trade. 
* **Watch for ripple effects. This is already happening.** When funds get liquidated, they have to buy back all their other shorts (see AMC, BBBY) and sell their longs (look at BABA after-hours). Want to play GME without playing GME? Maybe throw a little $ at BBBY. You do you. 
* In EndGame Part 2, I talked about potential investors, and how the higher price is gonna attract the bigger $. Today we saw Chamath, Winklevoss, and others. And then Elon tweeted and simultaneously stimulated the buying frenzy and scared the crap out of shorts. I'm just gonna copy what I said about this potentiality
   * ***Elon****: (Least likely, completely improbable, but cataclysmic event). Elon hates shorts. Elon, with TSLA, went through the pain that GME is going through. TSLA almost went bankrupt because shorts were pushing the price down so it was difficult to raise the cash they needed to survive. Sound familiar?* ***Elon‚Äôs wealth swings more in a day than GME is worth in entirety.*** *Elon could* ***buy all the fucking float of GME with what he makes in 8 hours****. One call from fellow entrepreneur and* [*aspiring twitter-meme-god*](https://twitter.com/ryancohen) *would absolutely wreck the game.*

1. ***If you are short gamestop****, you are one meme purchase by the richest man in the world away from a fucking cataclysmic event. ""Hey son, I heard you like games. So I bought you gamestop. All of it."" üöÄ*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1.) COVID vaccine rollout has started, and we will be able to attend movies soon. The Biden Administration (sorry for getting political, just pls keep reading) has an ambitious plan (100 million vaccines in 100 days or whatever the fuck) and this pandemic is almost over. I‚Äôd give it until the end of the year.

2.) **Most** [**AMC**](https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-ent-movie-theaters-reopening-0123-2021) **theatres** [**are open**](https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean#locations) or they are planning to open soon with social distancing and mask measures in place. They will shut down the food services and concessions, but they are coming back.

3.) **Consumers have a sentimental connection to movies. They will come back**. People are starved for the outside world and will come out in massive hordes to watch movies. People will go out and see movies, take their kids, go on dates, etc. Nothing can replicate the experience of a giant screen and surround audio.

4.) This major influx of blue balled movie goers will cause a major boost in 2021. Then we will see a continuation of the year over year growth we have been seeing since 2012.

5.) The AMC business model is working. The revenue has steadily increased since 2012 year over year. [**In 2012, they made $811 million. In 2019, they made $5.47 billion.**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/206959/revenue-of-amc-theatres/) There has been a steady rise. **THEY ARE NOT IN DECLINE.**

6.) I understand they have many loans, but it is something that can be paid off in a few years with the help of their parent company, Wanda Entertainment, and increased profits in 2021.

7.) They will not go bankrupt. WANDA entertainment, a Chinese company owns the plurality share (20%) and will bail them out if it is necessary. They bought for $2.6 billion in 2012, and have seen a ROI, scoring $2.7 billion in 2013, the year immediately after their purchase. AMC is too good of an asset for Wanda to lose them. Also, AMC can take advantage of new stimulus and other government assistance programs.

8.) It‚Äôs extremely cheap right now because everybody is shorting, and there‚Äôs a pandemic. Corona is only temporary. Everybody thought GameStop was going to go under, until we showed them. Remember that.

9.) If there is interest or heightened trading in the stock, AMC can dilute shares and sell them to help finance operations and pay debt, using stock sales as leverage. AMC just did this today, and they can do it again if needed.

10.) AMC will not go bankrupt, not only because of the potential Wanda bailout, but [**they also raised $917 million today. They have enough runway to stay operational the end of the year. ""Bankruptcy is off the table for now.""**](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/25/amc-ceo-adam-aron-on-917m-financing.html) (We should be able to return to theatres by then.) A slight majority of this new liquidity comes from issuing new shares, as described in 9. They are also planning to do debt/equity swaps, so those who take out debt can hold shares in the company, and AMC won't get fucked over by high loan payments.

11.) [**AMC is about 70% shorted**](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)**, there is much potential to cause a squeeze**. However, there are still many more reasons to invest in AMC beyond a simple short squeeze.

12.) AMC does very well when it is not pandemic. $5.4 billion in revenue last year, and there will be many movies, as well as many moviegoers that come out after the pandemic. Especially with major franchise movies, which have been delayed. They [have also reached a deal with Universal, which allows Universal to do home releases earlier, but stipulates they must be in theatres for 17 days before that.](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/universal-amc-deal-theaters-pandemic-1234801134/)

13.) AMC is only $12 a share right now... Even if it loses, you‚Äôre only going to lose a bit. Meanwhile, the ceiling is high, and there is much potential. If you want in, do it now while it's cheap. People keep talking about how dumb it is to buy during the pandemic, but this is the point of largest potential. Don't wait for the recovery to buy.

14.) AMC used to trade at $10 before the pandemic. Let‚Äôs keep it at its former glory. AMC deserved a $1bn market cap and they got one. They will probably hit $20 tomorrow (predicting $25 by Feb1, peak in summer with COVID all done.).

15.) Even though the Net income is negative and they lose money, it consistently stays in the hundred thousands range, and it does not lose that much. Any autist on here from GME could pay the difference. [**AMC has also increased gross profits year over year, from 2,004,200 in 2016, to 3,493,200.**](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amc)

*(The rest of these bullet points are just jokes, so feel free to skip if you want.)*

16.) Without AMC there‚Äôs no place to spend my AMC points, and there better be a place for me to spend those points because I invested my entire life savings into those damn AMC stubs.

17.) Going to the movies was my childhood. We must save my childhood. DO NOT LET AMC DIE. Save AMC.

18.) You can take ur wife and her bf to the movies when this is over.

19.) The AMC food court literally sells tendies. (But we should call AMC tendies popcorns instead.)

20.) **STONCCS only go up.**

21.) you guys are all retard who cannot think for themselves and will do whatever is echoed in this fucking internet cave.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TL;DR : AMC has done a great job with fundraising and can survive until the end of the year. Vaccine rollout has started, and recovery is coming soon. People are due to return to movies. About 70% of shares are shorted, so we can potentially trigger a squeeze.

# Pandemic recovery & squeeze combo.

**Buy AMC. Or don‚Äôt. Your choice.**

**If you‚Äôre with us, let's save the movies. I hope you like popcorn. Get on the rocket, because you're going to the moon.**

**If you don‚Äôt, then bye bye, I wish you the best.**

You leave the Michelin 3-star restaurant that you decided to bring your wife and her boyfriend to.

You think to yourself¬†*wow* *Siri has gotten 10 times better after BB bought over AAPL and merged Siri with QNX.*

You go out back to your usual spot but notice there‚Äôs a homeless man there sleeping in the dumpster. Andrew then says¬†*It‚Äôs $12,200 for a handie*. Exactly the price of one GME share. Oh god‚Ä¶ has he really not covered his short position yet?! You take out your wallet to pay Andrew his fee but he catches you off-guard and snatches it away from you. He throws your wallet to the man in the dumpster and they both made a run for it. In the darkness you vaguely make up the back of the man‚Äôs shirt which read ‚ÄúMelvin Capital‚Äù.

You shake your head as you take out your phone and tell SiriQ to send aid. Two beams of light descend from the sky and blast Andrew & Melvin.¬†*Impressive*¬†you think to yourself as you witness first hand the power of GothamX, a collaboration between Palantir and SpaceX.

Not even a mod.

Melvin and all his üåà üêª friends were tilling away to take away the tendies of WSB, blinded by their arrogance and greed that has gotten them so far.

Cramer the once exiled boomer has become a semi-respected boomer for sticking up for retail investors,  but MSM has sided with the MMs for so long, the retards cannot fully trust him.

It is AH and GME is sitting at $89, up 310% in the past week. Your wife has just returned home from the Wendy's you work at with her BF. Not to be forgotten he got you a frosty, your favorite flavor. You eat away merrily as he rails her in the next room, staring at Robinhood and WSB for updates dreaming of tendies. Falling asleep with tendies on your mind with honey mustard dipping sauce.

Boomers and manipulators have been trying to dissuade you and your fellow tards for weeks that GME is a dying business. But Papa RC has come down and spread his loving arms showing a path to greatness. There has been volatility and GUH along the way for those who bought at the top. But they know what is to come. 

The SEC has just finished its preliminary report, and WSB has been deemed a coalition of degenerate gamblers and fetishists of pee drinking cuckholds. Completely innocent of wrongdoing.

The following morning, its 430AM, you open up your trading app, GME is at $690.42 (nice). You roll over on your dog bed to tell Chad and your wife the good news. Market opens: Melvin and Shitron have fled the country and GME is trading at $4206.90. 

You stare at your one share and think.... I made a difference, sell. And go back to sleepies.

Look into Renesola or $SOL they just did a offering to a bank of a quarter billion dollars today which put the stock on sale. This is on top of recently paying off all of their debt and starting a venture into Europe of 1GW of energy this year. (1GW is worth 1 billion dollars alone) it‚Äôs a steal at this price. It dropped from $35 to $25 today and will soon be in the $40-$50 range as it makes it way to $100. That would give it a 5 billion dollar market cap or for comparisons sake 1/5th of Enphase market cap (ENPH) when they make about 1/2 the revenue yearly. It‚Äôs a HEAVILY underpriced stock and will PRINT. Congrats if you get in.

If you‚Äôre wondering why it went down, They did a $250 million shelf offering to a bank. That tanked the price. It will be over after the 27th. Same thing happened at the $40 million offering 2 weeks ago it went from $21 to $16 then back up once the offering was done. Big boys are getting in. I think this will be a $100 stock at a minimum here soon. That $40 million wiped out the last of their debt they‚Äôd been paying off the past decade or so ($1 billion) and they‚Äôre now a clean green well running machine.

I would buy shares or leaps with this and just watch it grow.

# Fellow tards and mod-tards. This is the most boring post you will never read.

We are now entering a potentially dangerous phase for WSB. I won't repeat or cover all the various reasons why people are looking at this sub, nor what they are saying. 

The goal must be to ensure we don't tank this sub, and tank our tendies.

Its pretty simple: people who are used to making the rules and making money of the ignorance of others are on the wrong side of the trade, and they don't like it, and they won't take it laying down. 

üë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄ

They have extremely deep pockets and can throw insane amounts of money lobbying, getting talking heads on tv or lawyering up, if they haven't already. The narrative is pretty clear: WSB is acting like a mob; they are distorting the market; this isn't allowed. 

We are playing into their hands somewhat. We are helping fuel their arguments. If you don't want to lose this sub, here's what you can do

üåïüåùüåîüåìüåõüåíüåóüåòüåëüåñüåô

**1. Don't do dumb shit that will allow people to make legitimate complaints. Simple examples:** 

a. Doxxing or harrassing people e.g. Citron or Melvin Capital.

b. Trying to get people to buy particular shares of one stock in a concerted effort e.g. ""Lets all buy 10-100 shares of GME at 1000 EST.""

c. Publicly representing that we are in any way an organised, singular entity. 

**2. Don't give Reddit a reason to shut this down.** 

a. Chances of the SEC investigating WSB based on complaints are reasonably high; actually taking action though, the chance is v small in my view. For one, it would be hard to show intent and prove who was doing what to the price. Regulators only like to take on slam dunk cases - they dont have enough resources or political capital to waste on potentially losing hands. The exception is if there is a big public interest in doing so...this is another reason to observe point 1 above. This is not to say they won't give Reddit a call to say ""we think you need to sort out A,B,C‚Äù but this is v different from an enforcement action.

b. **Focusing on what the SEC might do misses the point. The threshold for a company disowning a small part of itself, to protect the whole, is very small. Reddit has 330M users. WSB has 2M. You do the math.**

Never mind trying to work out how much revenue Reddit makes from people who produce our quality of meme.

c. Any company who is aware that part of its users are breaking the law, or potentially breaking the law, will not hesitate to cut off the gangrene thumb. No one is going to go in for bat for us for some ideals or whatever. They are worried about bringing attention to the company as a whole, getting regulated, or civil or criminal exposure - as they should be - this is just normal and good governance. 

üíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíé

**3. Follow the rules for the sub. There are four elements here.**

a. Mods needs to tighten the rules to make it clear which conduct is not acceptable. I recommend including a small banner on each thread that states something like ""WSB does not tolerate any market manipulation or other breaches of law and those who do so will be instantly permabanned."" This can be hyperlink link to the rules or even SEC website.

b. But then - and this is important - the rules **must** be enforced. Whenever you have a compliance program in place, a regulator wants to see the compliance program was reasonable to achieve its required outcome e.g. Not breaking the law and that **it was enforced in fact**. If you have rules that are not enforced its almost worse than having no rules.

c. For us users, **don't break the rules**. Simples. 

d. And if you see other users breaking the rules, report it. Sounds like some Gestapo shit but at the end of the day, you either like this sub and want to protect it or you are going to miss the Tendieman. We have to collectively weed out shittiness and the mods are not going to be able to do this on their own - they are simply to retarded ;-) 

**4. Think about a serious plan B platform if this does get shut down.** 

Can't be Reddit - if the powers that be decide we are done, just calling it saulbeatwets or mallmeatnets won't fool them for long.

**5. Think about putting some tendie money aside to kick in for the mother of all lawsuits.** 

If this does go south, we should consider kickstarting a fund to hire the same type of white shoe law firms these dudes hire and get our guys to point out every known act of manipulation and let the SEC decide who the real problem is. This is how you really fight back and win. 

**6. While I have your attention - can we please try not to take out fellow retards here.** 

Its a big bad world and I can watch my own six and yep everyone needs to learn the hard way. But I don't think we should be out here bitching about Melvin etc while we are trying to shaft each other. If you see this shit, call it out and we'll gather our pitchforks. 

In return, **newbies please f$#@ing read some shit on here before you ask the same question ad nauseum** (the answer is the same anyway: ""No, its defo not too late to FOMO everything you or your tribe owns into an extremely volatile YOLO play and there is no way this can go tits up.‚Äù

**TL:DR: They are coming for this sub. Don't make it easy for them; follow the rules and mods enforce them.**

l562zq||It's official: Stop freaking out about the media asking to have WSB investigated or possible SEC action|t3_l562zq|0.99|10141|10141|top|2021-01-26 07:23:11.000000|NrdRage|791|DD|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l562zq/its_official_stop_freaking_out_about_the_media/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l562zq/its_official_stop_freaking_out_about_the_media/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l562zq/its_official_stop_freaking_out_about_the_media/|"Since,  apparently, nowhere in the 2.2 million people reading this sub is a  single god damned lawyer (ok, plenty of jailhouse lawyers - I see you,  Mr. Diggs) and because this is a really slow time of year for my firm  while we wait to see how this whole vaccine thing shakes out, I assigned  one of my staff attorneys to look into the concerns I've seen expressed  a lot here lately, specifically as it pertains to ""market manipulation""  and potential liability exposure stemming from how this sub has  basically become a very large hedge fund comprised mostly of autists who  appreciate great memes.

Here's the short of it:

\-  15 U.S.C. ¬ß 78 is the relevant US code that governs market  manipulation.  It's got a few rules.  Publicly traded companies have to  regularly make disclosures (so not WSB).   And it regulates exchanges,  dealers, brokers, insiders, and employees of publicly traded companies  (only you can decide if you're one of these.  Personally, this raised an  interesting question for me because I'm in venture capital (that,  thankfully, it looks like I'm OK on), but YMMV.  Maybe you work for a  meme company and have gone full retard.  You're on your own.

***Obviously, ""market manipulation"" is what everybody here is shaking their titties over.  The rules here are pretty simple.***

\-You  can't ""create false demand"" or overtly distort prices.  Remember, this  law was written in the 1930's, so being able to lie about something's  price was easier back then.  Not really applicable today.  Nobody here  is creating ""false"" demand.  In the case of short squeezes, it's  creating ""actual"" demand.

\-Can't  talk about insider information - yet to see that here, so all good.   Even if I did see it, I wouldn't trust half of you to properly interpret  what you read unless it was full of rocket ships or eggplants.

\-Can't  spread false information about a company.  While I would argue there's  actually a lot of that here, it's not with intent, it's out of ignorance  99 out of 100 times.  Further, the SEC hasn't effectively enforced this  rule in decades.  There are hedge fund managers who openly admit to  breaking this law.   Plus, the original intent with this law was  (apparently, according to lawyer) meant more for companies to not pull  an Enron.  It is, in other words, in effect toothless.

\-The  interesting one is with regards to group trading.  So there's a whole  set of rules that comes into play when an organized group of traders own  more than 5% of a company's stock.  I'll spare all the boring middle  details here because the conclusion is nobody KNOWS how much of a  certain company's stock this sub collectively owns.  I would posit a  very strong theory that we own quite a bit more than 5% of Gamestop,  BUT....there's never been a straw poll to prove it and nobody here has  any real way of knowing if that's the case.  Even if somebody did, they  would have to effectively communicate it to everybody else in the sub to  alert them of potential conflicts/problems, because ""intent"" is a  qualifier for this particular rule.  There's no fucking way this island  of misfit toys is going to be effectively communicated that status.   Even if that information did become widely known, it would be impossible  to prove that rocket emojis, calling people paper handed bitches for  exiting a position, or telling people to let their wives' boyfriends  take care of the women while you're off earning your tendies qualifies  as illegal coordinated manipulation.  Especially given how many bots and  shills Melvin has deployed here lately trying to discourage or scare  people into selling their positions.

Which  means what everybody largely suspected, anyways:  All the people on TV  are blowing hot air to try and scare people at the behest of their hedge  fund manager bosses and to create a story that fits a pre-defined  narrative.  The SEC doesn't give two shits about you and isn't spying on  you (but that plumbing van that's been outside your house might be a  problem - your wife's boyfriend might have gotten a boyfriend), and you  can take off the tin foil.  Unless you're long REYN, in which case  you're probably helping your Boomer stock oh-so-slightly, Randy.

TL:DR:  Securities Fraud requires fraud, which requires intent, so

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ  = fine

üíéü§≤ = fine

üåàüêª  = not just fine but necessary

ü¶çü§≤üí™  = just good strong community bonding

**Having  a Gamestop badge and saying the stock is going to $420.69 = You might  want to start practicing the doctrine of Shut The Fuck Up Fridays**

On top of this they have have lost 30% and January isn't even finished yet. The key here is that now everyone knows the precarious situation Melvin got themselves in. Now think a second about the type of clients that would have their wealth stashed away at Melvin Capital. These are people with so much money that they've never even thought once about what it would be like to work at a Wendy's.  They aren't trying to YOLO their last scrap of savings into weeklies, they're expecting good returns every year and they think they're rich enough that risk doesn't apply to them.

Now they see all over the news that their hedge fund is in SERIOUS trouble.  They see that they almost got margin called on a position with UNLIMITED loss potential.  The first one who realizes this will also realize that their only chance of not losing it all is to be the first one to leave Melvin.  Once that happens the dominos start to fall.

Remember, shares never expire and even without a squeeze the bull target for gme is $169 [gmedd.com](https://gmedd.com).

l57i0n||The Bullish Thesis for NEE üîãüöÄ|t3_l57i0n|0.48|0|0|controversial|2021-01-26 08:51:36.000000|EricPike|22|DD|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l57i0n/the_bullish_thesis_for_nee/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l57i0n/the_bullish_thesis_for_nee/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l57i0n/the_bullish_thesis_for_nee/|"# NextEra Energy is the play that you need to make if you believe in Biden's infrastructure reforms.

(before reading, note that they are reporting earnings on the morning of the 26th, I will be taking advantage of the IV crush to open a LEAP position)

To start, I see an awful amount of praise for ETF's when playing this sector. However, while ETF's offer greater security in individual investments, the true risk and reward of playing this sector becomes apparent through the lens of comparison. The three ETF's I concentrated on for this DD are:

* **ICLN**
* **TAN**
* **FAN**

While these are all popular, none of them have weighted NEE anywhere near its capitalization potential. Just the next two years alone will nearly certainly double the stock's market cap. They have over $50B in infrastructure investments planned through 2022, and you can be assured that they will have an advantage to this [in the form of tax credits and subsidies.](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/nee-stock-is-ready-to-soar-under-green-biden-administration/)

That's right, Uncle Sam is going to skullfuck this company with tax credits and subsidies to the point that this thing could have a TSLA-esque potential. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, how does this company look when lined up among some competition?

The particular interest with NEE is that they seemingly do it all. This shit is like the Chic-Fil-A of the energy sector. It could honestly not give less of a shit about saving the world, its only focus is cash flow, which in terms that WSB is accustomed to, is just fuel reserves for its inevitable moon mission. I analyzed 3 different companies in the renewable energy sector, and those were

1. Plug Power
   1. slowing of net income in Q/Q growth.
2. Enphase
   1. already boomed. the party for this one got busted pretty fast. imo just a shitty boomer pick
3. First Solar
   1. This one is a legitimate competitor in my view. 
   2. I would honestly invest in this if its revenue sources were more diverse.

So taking these into account, NEE seems as if its obligatory duty is to take the throne of the renewable market (if you're for some reason doubting it even slightly)

# TLDR: EZ CASHFLOW, ECO-CONSCIOUS, and *bigly* expansion with tax credits incoming to help assist.

When (not if, WHEN) gme skyrockets again, I want to see those posts of tattoos, vanity license plates, commissioned paintings and all the stupid shit that you said you'd do/buy with your earnings. When it's finally your turn for the rona vaccine, tell the nurse you don't need one- you're already autistic- but she can go ahead and load up that needle with some ink for your WSB tattoo that you promised you'd get on your ass when GME moons.

EDIT: Some of you already owe this sub your tattoo videos. u/raymofuwk I'm looking at you, you owe us a WSB-GME tattoo as it is over $200 after market now. Time to pay up!

EDIT2: u/lightlyGhosted you coward, deleting your comments. You owe us a tattoo of the WSB logo kid on your ass when GME passes 1k, u/skultun owes us the WSB kid on your ass and a rocket tattoo- you can do the rocket tattoo anywhere on your body since you didn't specify ass but the WSB kid MUST be on your ass.

I will update with all the bets that are owed, for now u/raymofuwk you have 48 hours to produce proof of your tattoo appointment being booked, or be banned. EDIT: Proof produced, can't wait to see that fresh ink go BRRRR

u/yotta_T100 you bet $200 and the WSB logo somewhere on your body.

# Prelude

I own 100 shares. This is no advice to invest. Do your own DD.

*ignore the +100%. f¬¥ing boomers sold this shit in premarket.*

# TLDR:

Company established a groundbreaking drug, Voclosporin. It has many benefits (more efficent, orally given, less side affects). They have the patent until 2037(!). The company expects 65K$ per patient - at least 200K patients in the US \* how many are actually treated = 1.3B $. They have 400M $ cash on hand + an aggreement for licensing the drug in Japan + EU for 100M $ + various milestone payments + 10-20% of revenue.

In total:

1.8B $ alone for the first year in the US, 1.3B $ is recurring revenue + 10-20% of revenue once EU/Japan approve the drug. Market cap? Only 2.3B $ Buyout? CEO and Chairman are open for it + have created comps which were bought out in the past by major pharm players.

# Establishing Voclosporin

SLE ( Systemic Lupus Ery. ) is an autoimmune disease. Various stages, various form. One of the worst is Lupus Nephrithis. In this form the functional units of the kidney, the nephrons, are attack by the bodies own immune system. The functions of the kidney fall off a cliff. Untreated the diagnosis is death.

[pretty shit to suffer from this](https://preview.redd.it/fgxut51hfmd61.png?width=1595&format=png&auto=webp&s=34e84cdf5ae2653cb1053711f60794d68bded1fe)

Current SoC / standard of care is the major use of steroids and using drugs to depress the immunesystem. This SoC is pretty shit as it is suboptimal and only helps few ppl improve. The target according to guidelines is:

*TLDR: decrease the secretion of protein*

Enter Voclosporin / Le blockbuster

It is a member of the Cyclosporin fam - so called calcineurin inhibitors. As I had to suffer through human physiology in this semster: they inhibite this molecule which turns on various immunological pathways.

With Voclosporin they are faster (only need 50% of the time), better, can be used on more classes of LN, can cut down on steroids and all it takes is a pill.

They have been prepared for the liftoff. They boost a variety of people to influence all parameters of the equation: physicians, patients and insurance

# Tendies

The company owns the IP until 2037. This is incredibly bullish. Only one competitor exists: Benelysta by GSK (actually GSK bought the comp and did not develop it themself). They are inferior in every aspect + it¬¥s not an orally given pill but and injection - yikes.

The *CEO was kinda retetarded* during the webcast yesterday. Well he had to be. So this part is a bit hard.

As LN is a rare disease the number of ppl affected is only roughly known. Therefore yesterday was kinda shit with the analysts as they were expecting a precise number on the revenue. The CEO was only able to provide the lower bound on the revenue.

https://preview.redd.it/brsuo5yrmmd61.png?width=1586&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cc001092a8a0c5e773f683b42169b4eeabe3503

AUPH provides patients with the pills package - called a wallet. This wallet contains around 60 pills. The patient takes 6 pills daily - i.e. this package lasts 10 days. Now here I¬¥m a bit retarded BUT the CEO said they price the wallet to be 65K $ meaning a patient will receive the drug for 30 days will net the comp around 3x 65K. However the slides say 65K $ so I¬¥ll leave it at that. => 65K $ per patient

Now, conservative estimates for the number of ppl suffering from LN is 200K - 300K. In my TLDR section I already did some math to figure out that the combination of those low estimates yields around 1.3B $ in revenue. 65K \* 200K \* actually treated patients = 1.3B

Add the 400M $ cash on hand + the licensing agreements and we have around 1.9B $ while the market cap is only 2.3B $. Once the real numbers and not just the low estimates are starting to pile up they will improve the share price.

This disease affects women and people from ""minority populations"" more often. These groups are the prime target of political actions taken by the progressive politicans.

Having this disease be common in those populations the real number of patients to be treated may be higher. On a humanitarian note, ""minority populations"" suffering from a disease and society not giving a damn is pretty bad."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001759.csv|StockTicker|['A', 'GME']|['GME']|['TLDR', '$AUPH', 'I', 'DD', 'K', 'US', 'B', 'M', 'EU', 'M', 'B', 'US', 'B', 'B', 'CEO', 'D', 'ST', 'W', 'DD', 'SLE', 'C', 'C', 'I', 'LN', 'IP', 'GSK', 'GSK', 'CEO', 'LN', 'CEO', 'AUPH', 'BUT', 'CEO', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'LN', 'K', 'K', 'TLDR', 'I', 'B', 'K', 'K', 'B', 'M', 'B', 'B']|['AUPH', 'DD', 'ST', 'W', 'DD', 'IP', 'GSK', 'GSK', 'AUPH']

By now you should also know that Melvin are getting around $3 billions in help/investment to bail them out. The battle has just started and the fact that the shorters refuse to back down is actually good news. In simple terms it means that when the short squeeze starts it will be a massive one. Dont be fooled by the media narrative which is controlled by shorters such as Melvin, Citron & Co. The short squeeze has not even started yet. The whales are coming, the margin calls are coming, the shorts will soon liquidate and GME will fly into to the moon. Be patient and hold!  üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Remember it‚Äôs not ‚Äújust‚Äù the hedge funds. It‚Äôs their rich as fuck clients that expect to never have to worry about money. They are gonna be pissed that their accounts took a hit, and hedge funds will blame us.

The long and short of $NOK is they are a wildly undervalued stock in a particularly nifty low IV position primed to take off like wildfire. From eating Huawei's lunch to building cell towers on the moon for NASA to GLOBAL 5G to RAN architecture to a new CEO.. THE LIST GOES ON. 

**ANOTHER TL;DR** - WITH THE GOVT CONTRACTS, COMPANY RESTRUCTURING, 5G INFRASTRUCTURE PLAYS, GLOBAL MKT CAP OPPORTUNITIES $NOK IS EASILY $8-10 PER SHARE IN A COUPLE WEEKS/MONTHS AND THAT IS BEING EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE.

**EDIT** - Listen boys, I know there's a lot of fervor on WSB right not about GME and understand I am 100% in (1000 shares between two accts) but not hedging/diversifying in general is EXTREMELY retarded. You can hold GME and still make solid plays. Check my acct history, I've been posting on WSB for years since RITEAID, literally only mods remember that shit.

*Edit: I dont know the mods took this down the first time I posted it. I think it was due to some language that I have tried to remove in edit.*

I think this is going to get a bunch of downvotes because it's not bullish. But someone else recently posted on here that they werent seeing two-sided conversations anymore and it seemed as though there were at least some people who upvoted him. I have enjoyed the actual DD posts I've found on here and thought that this was a good read so I thought I would pass along.

I emailed one of my best friends who runs software for his HF and asked what he thought about BB / whether I should hold onto my shares. I edited / redacted some lines to help protect his identity, and bolded a few for emphasis. His fund was up almost 100% last year and as you'll see in his comments, they were / are long a number of other WSB stocks, which I thought definitely added some credibility.

Anyways, take it for whatever it's worth, but thought I'd pass along. I am going to sell my BB shares at open and buy more GME + the other names he recommended to me, which I'm going to start doing some reading on.

\-----------

Hey man, you should take whatever I say with a grain of salt as nothing I say should be considered investment advice. But to give you a sense, **our biggest winners last year as a fund were TSLA, CRWD, and two companies who sell vertical software into the auto ecosystem (so I'd say we know both the security and auto tech space very well). We also currently own GME shares, which I think this still have room to run.**

**But from my vantage point, the BB move does not reflect fundamentals and the fair value of that stock is materially lower, ie. somewhere in the $7 range, and most likely lower.**

Yes, BB is a cyber security company now, not a mobile phone company. But that's nothing new. You can think of the company as having 3 parts: (1) non auto security (endpoint management + endpoint security), (2) QNX (autos), and (3) IP licensing.

**(1) Non-auto security:** UEM (unified endpoint management) and endpoint security (Cylance, what competes with CRWD). These businesses are getting absolutely smoked. This year was the first year that BB did not appear in the top right Gartner quartile, and MSFT has been eating their lunch bc their offering (InTune) is basically free. Churn in this segment is probably \~20% / year, and has been declining in revenue for multiple years now. Meanwhile, endpoint (Cyclance) has been a disaster. This last year, while the big endpoint companies (Crowdstrike, Carbon Black, Sentinel One) grew close to 100%, Cylance was flat / slightly down y/y (during the biggest endpoint boom in history). Everyone from that team left post acquisition ([https://www.crn.com/news/security/cylance-founder-ceo-stuart-mcclure-exits-months-after-blackberry-deal?itc=refresh](https://www.crn.com/news/security/cylance-founder-ceo-stuart-mcclure-exits-months-after-blackberry-deal?itc=refresh)) and they are falling way behind competitors. This blended segment is going to continue to fall in revenue y/y.

**(2) QNX:** this is probably the best situated segment on a relative basis, but still struggling. The hype around the AWS announcement is way overblown. QNX is not going to be on 100% of cars because of this. MSFT and GOOG both have auto OEM offerings that do the same thing. There is no way AWS is going to get 100% market share, because no one ever gets 100% market share in anything. And in particular, auto OEMs are never going to want a single supplier to have 100% market share, their entire supply chain is built around ensuring that doesnt happen. The only reason AWS partnered with them is because they needed someone who already sold to auto OEM's to get their foot in the door. GOOG already has auto relationships from Android Automotive, while MSFT has a number of auto partners already signed on to their platform ([https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-connected-vehicle-platform-trends-and-investment-areas/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-connected-vehicle-platform-trends-and-investment-areas/)). So this lets AMZN cross-sell with someone and gives BB a reason to choose them. Right now BB has about 30% market share of cars that on the road. Even if that doubles in 6 years, you'd only be up to $8-$10 in value, because as they add ADAS customers, they are losing all their infotainment customers that make up current base. Also, AMZN is not going to ""share"" any of the recurring revenue with BB. BB has said they ""hope"" to cross sell their own new services as part of IVY, and when we talk to auto customers about this they laugh at the idea that they'd rather buy those services from BB over AMZN. Finally, QNX will not ""be needed on every single EV"" as some people claim. I think the bigger market there is rather than have the security built into a proprietary OS like QNX, you'll see cars start to include endpoint agents themselves (ie. from Crowdstrike or Sentinel One). CRWD is piloting this program today with a few OEMs.

**(3) IP Licensing:** this is effectively their mobile division that has transitioned from being in house to sold to 3P's. Mgmt has said this is going to be flat on a forward basis and will start declining in a few years (avg patent life of 10 yrs, no new R&D). If you assume this is currently a 90% gross margin business, then IP currently makes up 100% of the firms profits (software is not yet profitable).

Two final notes - BB's business does not generate ""recurring"" revenue. This is pretty easy to tell bc every quarter, the ""recurring"" ARR goes down, and quarterly revenue is not = at least 25% of the disclosed recurring revenue amount. Also, this is no longer a company at the cutting edge of technology, despite what people are saying. Again, easy way to tell this is that R&D has been falling every quarter since they made the Cylance acquisition two years ago. How many co's do you know that are investing for the cloud / new products that are spending less on R&D every quarter?

**So at the end of the day, you have a software business that has declining revenue and is not yet profitable, an auto product that is losing share on its legacy infotainment business, and an IP business that is going to fall off a cliff in a couple of years. Aggregate revenue is going to be rising low single digits and EBITDA growth after next year will be flat.**

In terms of valuation, dont forget to dilute the share count by 60mm shares for the convert they just issued last quarter. **If you give the company a generous 20x fwd EBITDA on out year bullish numbers the upside case is $10/sh, while the base case is more like $5-7.**

**If you really believed the upside case, then I could see rationale for buying at $6 to play for the $10 of upside.** That's fair. But The idea that this is a $100bn or even $20bn mkt cap is ludicrous. We arent short the name, but I would strongly advise you not to put a significant portion of your money in the stock. It very well may go up bc there's no telling how high stocks on these momentum moves can go, but at some point you have to be the one holding the stock and I dont want it to be you. Stock's can only maintain their value in the multi-billion valuation range at the end of these runs if there is institutional demand to buy the next share (which is what happened in TSLA), and I dont think that exists for BB north of $10.

**I think there are much better things to put your money into.** We still own **GME** (which I know is a a favorite among your friends), which I think has a much better setup. If you want security software exposure, I would tell you we're bullish on **PANW, CRWD, and ZS**. If you want auto tech exposure, I'd say you should look at **LPRO**, which recently SPAC'd and isn't yet followed / understood by the street. A couple other random longs I like right now are **BABA** and **PENN**.

Feel free to lmk if you have any follow up questions. Glad to see you're focused on the fundamentals."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001801.csv|StockTicker|['$BB', 'DD']|['DD']|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'BB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'HF', 'BB', 'I', 'I', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'BB', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'TSLA', 'CRWD', 'GME', 'I', 'BB', 'BB', 'QNX', 'IP', 'UEM', 'BB', 'MSFT', 'AWS', 'QNX', 'MSFT', 'GOOG', 'OEM', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'GOOG', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'BB', 'BB', 'ADAS', 'AMZN', 'BB', 'BB', 'IVY', 'BB', 'AMZN', 'QNX', 'I', 'OS', 'QNX', 'CRWD', 'IP', 'IP', 'ARR', 'D', 'D', 'IP', 'BITDA', 'BITDA', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'BB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'PANW', 'CRWD', 'A', 'I']|['DD', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'GME', 'IP', 'MSFT', 'MSFT', 'GOOG', 'GOOG', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'AMZN', 'AMZN', 'IP', 'IP', 'ARR', 'IP', 'PANW']

And was asked to post this as a discussion.

The most important thing is actually **until Friday there** will be another **price** battle in which the short sellers will try to keep as many calls as possible outside the price so that they cannot be executed and the broker does not have to buy them on the market to cover them .  
It is particularly critical because **monthly and weekly calls** expire, as far as I know the highest monthly call was **60c 1/29** and **115c 1/29** (left out the new 200c).

The MM will try everything to push the course **below 60** , **our goal to get to 115** . Until then, **expect massive short attacks** , it will probably be even more blatant than yesterday. Since a price limit is harder to keep higher up, don't be surprised if there is a red tag up until then or the lower limit is 60-80.  
For those of you who don't know what is meant, 100xLimit orders at $ 60 are $ 6000 <$ 11500 100x at $ 115 and easier to hold or buy from autistic people.

And almost most importantly **, put your stop loss out** , the **shortsellers try** to trigger as many as possible with their short sales in order to trigger **a chain reaction of panic selling** .

Remember **yesterday we saw exactly that** , price dumping at its finest, although almost no short position was powered.

Should we be **able to hold the $ 115 by Friday** , the banks (! Not the shortsellers) would have to buy an additional 8 million shares to cover the demand for the calls. To achieve this there is really only the possibility üöÄ‚úãüèªüíéü§öüèª,

**Don't be a paper bitch!**

All figures relate to estimates and information or assumptions and observations from DD from here and the Angelsachen forum. Due to the high trading volume, it is not possible to say how the share is currently distributed !!

**This is not a financial advice, but an autistic one.** **Always invest wisely and make your own decisions.**

And now relax America won't open for another 4 hours anyway.

Keeping holding and relax.**

With a lot of chatter going around and some excellent DD being shared with lots of technical analysis there still seems to be doubt as to 1) If the squeeze is happening, and 2) How to capitalize on it.  Please spend a few minutes reading this so you're more informed as a trader (even if this is your first time being a trader).  This is not a technical analysis but more a plain English guide:

1. **Crazy price volatility:** I think this one is self-explanatory but if you're wondering what price volatility looks like go check out a Google chart from the past week or so.  A stock moving up 20%+ day after day after day is not typical.
2. **Those who stand to lose the most go on the offensive:** At this point it is fairly well established that WSB has many user accounts being used for a variety of purposes, but at the moment many of those accounts are trying to drum up emotional responses to counter the short squeeze.  People hyping new tickers with far less short-term upside, saying that the facts are not true (remember kids: you're entitled to opinions but not your own facts).
3. **Those who stand to lose are taking MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR life lines:** Again, this so self-explanatory but yet still not all of us believe that a squeeze is happening.  During the 2008/2009 crash there were MAJOR US BANKS that were getting $2-5BN in bailout money to prevent the entire economy from collapsing.  Yesterday a relatively small hedge fund posing ZERO systemic risk took a $2.75BN bailout that without it would have likely seen them disappear from the system with ZERO impact to our greater economy as a whole.
4. **Confusion:** Have you noticed that some of the ""smartest guys in the room"" can't seem to agree on television and in the media as to what is going on??  If you actually believe that there is some debate going on amongst the experienced and elite Wall Street types then there may be no hope for you in life.  Con artists prey on the gullible and you will be a slaughtered sheep soon.
5. **Just f-ing hold if you like money!!:** If the above four bullet points haven't convinced you then nothing will so just sit back, relax, and let the men do our work.  If your wrists get weak and your paper hands get so feeble that you sell at these low prices then we (the real men of this sub) are better off without you owning the stock anyway.  AND STOP BUYING OPTIONS YOU STUPID IDIOTS! Calls were great to have bought in 2019, even into mid-to-late 2020, but the price you're paying for them now is a rip-off.  AND, the volatility on the price means your chances of losing money have never been better!

Warren Buffett has famously said at multiple shareholder meetings that he doesn't want people owning Berkshire stock if they're the type of *investor* that trades in and out of positions.

**You might be in the middle of something that will not happen to you again EVER in your investing life, or perhaps only a handful of times from now until you retire.  Don't screw it up by thinking that jumping off the fastest moving train, and one that is unique and a statistical anomaly, is going to happen again on some other ticker that has gotten the unfortunate meme status that the elite are trying to trick you into right now.**

NOK, BB, and others may all go up in the future and if you want to invest in them then you should wait.  How long??  Who knows.  And who cares?!?!?  You're probably in your 20's or even teens, you have plenty of time to invest in many good companies in your lifetime but quite likely NONE will go through this kind of movement over a period of a few weeks and if you sell now (you paper handed p-ssy) you will never forgive yourself.  HOLD, be patient, let the shorts bleed themselves to death, and in the meantime go focus on something other than Reddit!

Good luck to all.

***EDIT: I somehow forgot to add positions.  In keeping with the suggestion of others not to broadcast exact holdings (don't show the enemies your positions!) I will just say I have a high six-figure position of SHARES ONLY and I haven't even thought about selling for a moment.  This is not my biggest holding and my life won't be changed whether it eventually settles at $50/share or $500/share and YOURS WON'T EITHER SO BE STRONG.***

***EDIT II: Stop calling it a ""Loss"" if you bought at $X and it is now below $X.  An actual loss has not occurred until AFTER you sell, and if you don't sell then you won't lose.  It is not more complicated than that.  Seasoned investors (which are on the other side of every trade that you do) rely on you being emotional because they are using a computer with no emotion at all.  Don't be the sucker and don't actually lose money when instead you could actually have a gain!***"|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001715.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['RMENT', 'DD', 'I', 'A', 'WSB', 'LLION', 'OLLAR', 'MAJOR', 'US', 'BANKS', 'BN', 'ZERO', 'BN', 'ZERO', 'AND', 'STOP', 'UYING', 'TIONS', 'YOU', 'TUPID', 'DIOTS', 'AND', 'NOT', 'RICH', 'EVER', 'NOK', 'BB', 'NONE', 'HOLD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'HARES', 'ONLY', 'I', 'YOURS', 'T', 'ITHER', 'SO', 'BE', 'TRONG', 'EDIT', '$X', '$X', 'AFTER']|['DD', 'EVER', 'NOK']

# GameStop History Lesson:

**tldr**: GME bumbles about like a senile boomer and dabbles in terrible bets. Turns into undervalued stock with cultural significance, gets picked up by Big Dick Burry and Ryan Chewy Cohen.

GME is a childhood dream that turns any grown man into an autist as soon as he walks into the door. Now due to our Lady Rona (covid), a bunch of past Boomer business decisions ([GME fucking bough 507 AT&T stores](https://news.gamestop.com/node/10001) in 2014, not pivoting into omni-channel, [largely misssing the gaming industry explosion](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf), and [a CEO](https://news.gamestop.com/leaders/george-sherman) who prides himself on brick and morter Advance auto parts, Best Buy, Target, Home depot) GME by and large was shitting the bed as investors thought of this company as neglected mallfront with dwindling clientele.

&#x200B;

**In comes Michael big dick Burry**

With the stock trading at $3.78/share in August 2019 investers were sure it was finished. But here's where it gets interesting. With big dick energy seemingly out of no where Michael Burry *(yes that dude in the Big Short who seems like a fellow autist)* buys 2,750,000 shares or 3.05% of GameStock. In his actual [letter to the board](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190819005633/en/) *(yes I dug it up so you can read it as well)* he describes the thought process for the purchase bullets below.

* GameStop was trading at an all-time low ($3.78/share) and he believed that it had not leveraged it's ""elite potision in the gaming universe"" over the last 5 years *(keep in mind, it's fucking GameStop a cultural icon large enough to make a grown man weep with fond memories*
* Shareholders do not have faith in current managament and have not been inspired by new leadership policies
* At time of writing stocks were more than 60% shorted

&#x200B;

*(Taking a break to say, it's not too late the* ***squeeze has not been squoze*** *oblig üíéüôå = üöÄüöÄ)*

&#x200B;

**Ryan mega dick Cohen writes a letter**

Then in Nov 16th 2020, Ryan Cohen comes in swinging and tears a new one to the board members of GameStop. For people who don't know who Ryan Cohen is, he stuck the finger to Amazon and [built a digital e-commerce site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewy_(company)) (wiki link) for fucking dogs and cats into a $3.35 billion entity by 2017. Keep in mind that he submitted a Schedule 13D to purchase 121,644 shares at $6.56 per and 163,030 at $8.63 - that's a 10% stake [(yes, I've also dug the original Schedule 13d using google)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000699/rc13da2-091820.htm). Now Ryan's letter reads like a solid talking down that might rival the Queen - looking at you [r/TheCrownNetflix](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrownNetflix/), [r/AskUK](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/).

[I've included Ryan's letter to the board](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf) but will bullet point paraphrase below for you folks still on Yahoo or Ask Jeeves.

* GME has a strong brand across the globe and has 55 million PowerUp members
* GME needs to pivot immediately to a tech structure and it can *(lolz, after this letter they immediately brought Ryan and Chewy co onto board)*
* Size of the global gaming market has grown more than **2.5x** since the last console cycle

&#x200B;

**Ryan mega dick Cohen and team join GameStop board**

In January 2021 [Ryan Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen), [Alan Attal](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/alan-attal), and [Jim Grube](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jim-grube) join GME's board. Now for those of you in the bread line or living at your wife's mothers house playing [r/DnD](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/) with her boyfriend, board changes are big news. These board members have the power to make multiple grown men cry, fire CEOs like it's nothing and change a companies strategy sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.

With Papa Cohen coming onboard and his squad of Chewy troopers, it's likely that we are going to soon see a pimped out GameStop that will make you name your first born ""GME"". Now I'll let you do your own digging and reading but here's just some of the GME DD on it's future potential [(link to DD on some of GME's possible pivots](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/), [One DD to rule them all](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/))

# The squeeze has NOT been squoze:

There is still time for you to convince your wife's girlfriend to lend you money to buy GME. The squeeze has not been squoze and likely wont until we see the type of eruption that accompanied [r/belledelphineXmas](https://www.reddit.com/r/belledelphineXmas/) leaks (yes that sub is NSFW).

Side note on the Squeeze, GME is still massively over shorted at estimates from 130-300% and counting. The important thing to know is that these greedy bastards took multiple short positions on a single stock (naked) and essentially bet that GME was going to go down.

[https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today) (249.67% Shorted)

&#x200B;

**But what happened on Thursday/Friday?**

Gamma squeeze. Short and simple. Now you can read some other DD about what a gamma squeeze so I wont dive into it too much.

It was not the squeeze. Market makers needed to rush to fill calls that were In The Money. This prompted these market makers to buy up stock in the off chance that they needed to actually sell them to degens who were actually betting that GME would blow it's sweet load at 60 and now at 150 lolz. This pared with the low stock volume on the market makes for high volitility on a per stock basis. Here's some [DD links talking about what a Gamma squeeze what we witnessed was that.](https://nope-its-lily.medium.com/gamestop-power-to-the-market-players-part-2-6ef00eff1d26)

&#x200B;

**Ok MallCop2020, but when will it Squeeze?** *(when it does squeeze it may squeeze multiple times)*

Thanks to fellow autist [u/tsukune\_surprise](https://www.reddit.com/u/tsukune_surprise/) *(and no, CNBC I don't even know this person - they could be a robot or even a fucking dog with a cybor implant IDK!)* BUT I love their DD for the MOASS [(Mother of All Short Squeeze)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4bnfr/moatadd_for_the_moass_there_will_be_more_than_one/). Short answer is that it could be this week, could be next but it's hard to say when the big banks are using dirty tricks like naked call ladders, actual bail outs lolz. (*Fresh DD from another internet stranger on* [*GME EndGame Part 3)*](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l528pz/gme_endgame_part_3_a_new_opponent_enters_the_ring/)

>EVERY SINGLE indicator shows massive upward momentum on GME.

&#x200B;

**Okay, I've asked my wife's girlfriend nicely and now have $1k...**

Buy fucking shares. No legit, support your random internet brethren *(who don't know each other)* and buy shares of GameStop. Every share you buy bleeds money from Citron and Melvin.

Here's an explanation from [u/robert1032010](https://www.reddit.com/u/robert1032010/) a Hedge Fund Manager on the current short position within GME: [(A hedge fund managers perspective on GME)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/)

>The short positions of this issue appears (although I can't be certain) to exceed 100% with all available shares already lent out from marginal accounts and probably a lot of naked shorting going on as well. Although I don't yet have the current data on todays short position, I can say for certain the stock remains very heavily shorter, perhaps more so now than at any previous time. Today, I called my broker asking about the availability of shares to short and the borrow costs. We have one of the larger accounts at our brokers firm and I was able to speak directly to the ""hard to borrow"" desk. No borrowable shares are available at any broker, anywhere, at this time, even for high borrow costs or even from other brokers. This extreme short against a small common float, made more extreme no-doubt by naked shorting, could end very poorly for those short this issue. As they are forced to close out their positions, the stock will continue to rise and continue to exacerbate the positive effects the rising price has on the above 4 issues.

&#x200B;

Lastly, this is not financial advice; do your own DD. I'm holding $20k at $100/share and yes, I still fucking believe that the tendieman will come and rain tendies.

NOK sells for less than 5$, the cheap price appeals to retailers (retards) in the same way PLTR and GME's less than 30$ a share did for those who cant afford TSLA. I mean you can buy 100 stocks of NOK for less than 500$. think about that. the perfect distraction.

1:  NOK is an NEM. do you know who else is an NEM, Huawei, Ericsson, ZTE. hell even Samsung has aggressivly entered the market a couple of years ago and are strongly positioning themselves especially after Trump banned ZTE and Huawei.
these NEMs are called HENZ (Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia, ZTE) then changed to HENS as samsung grabbed ZTE by their banned balls. all these guys have been involved heavily in 5G. I know that from my 5G centric company.
EDIT: by centric I mean F500 at the heart of the 5G ecosystem.

2: most of the first world is almost done with 5G. yes infrastructure wise done. Im not talking about Zimbabwe (even though Huawei is clear winner in africa btw). 
btw for U.S smooth brains who cant think about the rest of the world, Verizon invested a lot in their 5G infrastructure and towers already, the best in NOT yet to come, it has already been done. AT&T are 90% done, they did a gay way in which all they need is a software update to switch to 5G from LTE. yes there is still a lot of money to be made in 5G market, but thats for full layer solutions, including application layer. I kid you not but people especially in the wireless infrastructure are looking at 6G now... *cough* samsung *cough*

3: NOK is a good company for INVESTING LONG TERM.  they have been early adapters for 5G in their strategy initiative and their execution plan. but that was just the necessarily of growth and survival. lol.of course they got in 5G! what else would they have done. it is the same way how they are going to get in 6G as well and 7G later... you smooth brains saying ""WoW 5G!"" is like looking at a house flipper guy by profession, who buys houses then flips them and sells them, and you retard say, this guy must be on the moon cause he keeps buying houses! well no shit idiots its what they do.

listen, I like NOK, great guys. but dont be fucking retards falling for the bots and implants by MM and melvin capital. NOK isnt going to moon. they are going to steadily grow so take that shit back to r/investing.

tldr; nothing special about NOK other than the cheap price tag ideal by MM to distract paper hands, HOLD your GME and squeeze.

This is actually the type of setup a large hedge fund might see and say hey if we can push BB over 25 by Friday it will cause so much frenetic buying that the stock might hit 40. 

Likely nothing will come of this, but if you are wondering why your favorite meme play is down today despite good news (BAIDU partnership) and LOTS of new money coming in on the buy side this is why.

"" I am long on MARA at these price levels. Here is why:- The [Elliot wave](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/elliottwaves/) theory seems to be taking play here and it looks like we are about to start impulsive wave 5 after seeing corrective wave 4. Follow the patterns.- The [RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/relativestrengthindex/) is bottoming out (oversold), perfect conditions for the tide to turn after a steep correction.- We seem to be bouncing off the 1.618 FIB, which we must hold or I think we will break down to the .618 FIB and bottom resistance levels around $8.

Everything is not matching up perfectly on the chart, but damn near close. ""

I see an uptrend followed by a bull run and then the famous pennant. A pennant is a sign that there is a breakout impending. The fact that it is doing a pennant in an uptrend makes it a bullish pennant.

I am holding 200 shares with a BE of $6.86. PT is $28. I'll be looking to sell my shares and roll into buying weekly calls if it doesn't break out tomorrow.

I think the large players are starting to realize they need to take the retards on reddit seriously. I think they're attempting to astroturf the investing subreddits by giving awards to tickers they have a vested interest in. And at this moment, that's anything that isn't GME. They know that once the prevailing enthusiasm subsides they'll have the opportunity to close.

Stay wary and stay vigilant my comrades. This is a war of attrition.

""Man,"" you think to yourself, ""Cohen City sure is beautiful this time of year."" Your blissful trance is interrupted by the whirring of your hover-Tesla landing itself by the pool. ""Good morning sir,"" chimes T3SS, the soft-spoken AI, ""your Neuralink has indicated your are in need of service."" You step into the back of the vehicle, taking a moment to run your hand across the soft, bear-leather interior. ""Take me to the nearest GameTower,"" you say with a smile, ""my girlfriend's husband has been a good boy lately, I thought I might pick him up a Switch 5 as a treat.""

Gliding through the remnants of Old Manhattan you can't help having a twisted sense of delight seeing the old hedge fund offices now in ruin. ""Serves them right,"" you sigh, shaking your head. As you descend to the ground entrance of MegaGameTower #8A, you hear an abrupt warning chime. ""Gay Bear detected at landing site,"" urges T3SS, ""Shall I commence eradication procedures?"" You look below to see the familiar sight of a desperate, tattered boomer on the sidewalk. Just before you can say yes, you notice a look in his eyes. You recognize this one, you've seen his face before. ""Actually T3SS, don't worry about procedures, drop me down next to him, I wanna talk.""

You step out of the vehicle and approach the man. You can tell he's clearly disturbed, rocking back and forth muttering ""tw-tw-TWenTY, tw- TWenTy"" to himself. He locks eyes with you, ""oh SIR, PLEASE sir, one short is all I need! can you PLEASE spare some credits for a poor analyst like me?"", he begs. ""Actually Andrew,"" you prod, his eyes widening from the shock oh hearing his name, "" I have a better idea. Let's take you inside, I'll buy you anything you want, I'll even throw in a year's worth of PowerUpPrime+ membership so we can't get you into an apartment, how's that sound?""He tears up, ""y-you mean you're not gonna hack me, or sign me up for Grindr?"" ""No,"" you assure him, ""I think you've had enough, I think it's time someone showed you that GameAzonCorp isn't the dying retailer you think it is."" ""b-but the NUMBERS?"" he stammers. You cut him off, ""Oh just look around you, you stupid lemon! They own this whole CITY, and the board is in talks of acquiring the Canadian Federation, do THOSE numbers add up?"" Andrew looks defeated, ""I-I guess you're right. I guess this whole time I was just hoping that one day, ONE day I'd be right about something. It's about time I start listening to market geniuses like you."" You smile, ""See, that wasn't so hard was it, come on buddy  let's go.""

Later that night, as you're tucking in your girlfriend's husband, he turns to you ""You really are the best cuckolder I could've ever asked for! Tell me again the story about how you defeated all the big mean boomers and became a trillionaire!"" You chuckle ""Haha, sure thing little buddy."" The story is a short one.

""The year was 2021. The retard army and I were holding the line as the evil bears were advancing, paper hands were dropping around us left and right, we weren't sure we could stay retarded much longer. But then, General DFV led us forward. We pulled together, diamond hands at full capacity, never selling, never using margin, until finally, FINALLY, the hedge funds relented. 'ENOUGH,' they cried, their clients' portfolios deep in the red, 'We surrender! Please, PLEASE let us buy your shares, we can't take it anymore!' And, well, the rest is history..."" you drift off seeing that he's asleep.

As you lay in bed you can't stop smiling thinking about that story. ""I've made it,"" you think to yourself, ""It was all worth it.""

This is a big moment. A tug of war between tradition and the future.

Hedge fund managers live in the past, and continue to look down upon the retail investors. They truly believe that we, the average retail investors, don't know anything about finances or the market (which may be true), and we're just gambling our money away.

We don't know any better. WE NEED HEDGE FUND MANAGERS TO TELL US WHAT TO DO! SAVE US!

This is the world they want to live in. This was the past.

Remember that scene from the Sopranos, where Tony's wife calls to buy 5000 shares of Webonics, after she was manipulated emotionally to so?  Institutions and hedge funds want us to be stuck in that world.

They're scared of the future.

They're scared because, so much information is available for free now. THere's no more fees for trading. We have large communities that discuss stocks and trading openly.

We can think and make decisions for ourselves, which scares the FUCK out of old school institutions and hedge funds.

Fuck them all. This affects every single one of you, whether or not you're holding $GME.

TLDR: Fuck hedge funds. This is a crosspoint into the future.

I am more than confident to say that a series of Whales have come to battle alongside with us retail shareholders. The Amount of volume and the amount of capital that was thrown at this stock today was nothing short of remarkable. The battle started at 11:01am EST, when the first short attack began, and the stock was able to find the floor at about $97.02. What followed was absolutely mind blowing.

For the next nearly two hours there was a series of extremely systematic buying. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that the whales have come to our aid. If you look at the chart below you will see that every 45 minutes there is a short attack of some sort and that attack is was denied every single time. Now I am not doubting at all in the strenght of out community, but the only folks out there with this much capital are other insitututions that want in on this historical event.

That's right I beleive at this time the Rohirrim has arrived lead by a mass of insitutional investors that want a slice of that 2.75 Billion dollar bail out. And they are willing to shell out at premium prices to bleed Melvin Capital Dry. There is still 30 minutes left in this session, lets just see how this plays out.

This is just an observation with rough hypothesis based on today's oberserved trading activity and is not advice.

EDIT: Just a Quick Update

[The BALLS on the trade desks of these firms. They all must have custom Hagar Pants being made in a spare office on the daily.](https://preview.redd.it/3ekdo813rqd61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcc42e0badc92f6e84af4435805fdc7eebc1bea3)

Looks like according to Level two trading, there is a significant ""Sell Wall"" at $150 for about 54k shares. So there is going to need to be some significant volume to push through that level, which is completely possible at the open.

**Bull Case:**

   *  More than $1b of normalized free cash flow generation on ¬∞$7b market cap. Guidance of $875-$975m in 21 with some excess cash flow.
   * Trades at like a 14-15% FCF yield vs. packaging comps trading at 6-7%, implying stock can double. FCF yields this high at time when Treasury rates at historical lows.

   * Plastics are not going away and are actually growing.
* Cheap vs. Competitors
   * Trades at ~7.6x EV/EBITDA vs. its closest competitor Amcor trading at ~11.5-12x.  (BERY is #2 and Amcor is #1 in plastic packaging with Berry being very close behind in size)
   * Small private transactions in the plastic packaging space on lower quality businesses have been in high single-digit context to low to mid-double digit context (10x+)
   * Stock more than doubles if it closes the valuation gap.
* Will start giving $ to Bulls this year
   * Company expects to start dividend/buybacks sometime in 21 after reaching its leverage target.
* Global leadership position with scale
   * 2nd largest plastics producers (~90%+ of biggest) and more double the third largest.
* Strong sustainability thesis
   * Plastic is actually better for the environment in terms of water usage, greenhouse gas emissions, solid waste, and energy than other items
* Leverage going down. Expects to reach 3.8-3.9x by September 2021
   * Should be able to start share buybacks/dividends to give cash to holders this year in 2021.
* Good acquisition history and consolidation opportunity
   * Strong track record of completing acquisitions and getting good synergies to make shareholder value.
   * BERY can continue to acquire small names and get cost-synergies, creating value.
* Not very well known	
   * Stock 98% held by üåà institutional boomers. Huge opportunity as it becomes more well known
* Downside Limited
   * Stock pretty fundamentally cheap even if bull case doesn‚Äôt play. Even in ‚Äúworst case‚Äù, hard to see this stock down more than 20% vs. current levels ex another great depression.  Downside is limited given the defensive industry and strong cash generation and ability of the company repurchase stocks beginning this year if the stock begins too cheap.
   * Pandemic also good for this stock as it makes masks.

üåà üêª üêª üêª

**Bear Case:**

* Boring/Boomer  Stock
   * Stock is not currently sexy and is in a ‚Äúboring‚Äù industry compared to EVs and traditional technology
* Low short Interest
   * Short interest less than 3% of the float so a short-squeeze is not an upside/thesis
* ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù leverage
   * Levered ~4.4x, currently, which is higher than other blue-chip names
* Plastic Risk
   * Boomer üåà üêª‚Äòs are worried about plastics going away, even though they‚Äôre not and growing. Business needs to show good organic growth to get rid of this fear.
* Raw material volatility
   * Company has to pass-through raw material changes to customers, which can cause short-term volatility. However company has strong pass-through mechanism and history doing it.

Key Catalysts:
* Earnings- Q4 Earnings Friday Feb 5th and Q1 earnings sometime in May.
   * Key question for earnings is continued organic growth of the business. Continued demonstration of growth allows this business to re-rate higher.
* Berry hitting 4x leverage and announcing either share buybacks or a dividend. Predict this to occur in mid 2021
   * Lower leverage and announcement of capital return may allow this business to re-rate higher.

**Prediction:**

I believe the stock offers strong upside in the highest probability base and bull case scenarios with limited downside in the bear case scenario.	

**Base Case Scenario:** Berry de-levers throughout this year to 4x or less and reports continued strong organic growth, partially helped by growth in their health-sector (BERY sells masks) and the industrial recovery when it occurs later in the year. They announce capital return to equity shareholders as well. The combination of these factors causes the business to re-rate closer to Amcor to ~10x EV/EBITDA or an 8% FCF yield in my base case. This leaves the stock at $100 in base case (roughly a double).

**Bull Case Scenario:** is this re-rates along with the market and üåà üêª  boomers realizing plastic continues to grow, allowing both it and its plastics comps to re-rate closer to the 13x-15x EV/EBITDA range, putting you at  a $150-$180 stock price target (making this potentially a triple). This is probably less likely in the short-term (next 1 year, but can occur if investing with a multi-year timeline)

üåà üêª  **Case Scenario:** Stock De-rates to 6.5x EV/EBITDA with soft organic growth , 16-18% FCF yield with a stock price of ~$43. Stock stays dirt cheap and is priced like plastics will not exist after 2026. I find this unlikely and this is only ~15% downside vs. today‚Äôs price.

Disclaimer: I own shares in both Berry and Blackberry. I am not a financial adviser and this is not investment advice.

Today we argued abt GME. I told him it was going to the moon, talked about the short sellers, shitron and such.

Now that Melvin is bankrupt, their position goes to their broker which are the big banks. Now, the banks want to close the position, but there are no paper hands in GME. They want to pay up, with Melvin money but there is none.

They can't even liquidate Melvin long portfolio and pay for their grim mistakes, a sacrifice offering not available.

So here is the problem, we can't win against the banks. If we are winning against the bank, our big boys in GME will get a talk with big brother.

Now if you read my post history you will find out that I am permabull holding $BB shares from $3 to $20. This is not why I am writing this DD on üöÄGMEüöÄ, no, full stop. I want üöÄGMEüöÄ brothers to go to one trillion dollars, because I know at the end of the day some of that will come to the deep value play of $BB.

The issue is if the banks who are soon forced to hold bankrupt short position cannot cover because of  üíéü§ö  =   üöÄ   üöÄ   üöÄ . Then there is a big problem, now the problem is not big right now since the market cap is only 10B on   üöÄ GME  üöÄ , but lets say we 10x again and head to 100B, one trillion, then this will bring down big banks.

**April 2020** \- Long story short, I started in April 2020 right after COVID, whereby I got introduced to some 'gurus'/paid courses to learn basic options strategies. Bought calls on everything tech, FB, AMD, SE, NVDA, PTON, FSLY, etc, etc. Started to find that ""money was so easy to make"" and even took out bank loans.

**August 2020** \- Indices rally all day everyday, stonks only go up, earnings always beat and stonks rally, made $175k in only 3/4 months.

**September 2020** \- Crashed hard for 3 days, and due to poor risk management with absolutely ZERO take profit / stop losses, watched ALL my tech calls bleed into oblivion. Profit got wiped out and I was literally back at breakeven. Wasted 4/5 months of my time, had no job, and was in debt. Went into semi-depression.

**October 2020** \- Figured I had to find get my money back, all I needed was just ONE good play to go all-in, and I would recover. Or at least that's what I told myself. Found this guy NoProblemChanging who seemed to be really accurate at predicting the markets - literally followed the advice of a stranger on WSB and went all in on puts due to his bearish views and certainty that the market was going to crash.

**November 2020** \- As we all know, everyone was expecting elections to be a shitshow but vaccine news rallied the markets with multiple gap ups and stuff. **By now I was already down $100k and was depressed. Imagine having made easy money ($175k in 4 months) in the greatest bull market of all time, only to lose it all in 3 days and even going negative, while seeing every stonk around me go up everyday while my puts bled all day. Not going to lie, at this moment I felt like $ROPEing although logically I know $100k is money that can still be earned back.**

I was so desperate at this moment that I HAD to find something that I could ALL IN and GUARANTEED to make money. Then, I found $GME. I found u/DeepFuckingValue and that's when I climbed into the rabbit hole, knowing it was a fundamentally undervalued company. Bought around $15\~. Huge credit to GMEShortSqueeze and u/Uberkikz11 as well.

**December 2020** \- By this time, I was pretty much already all in $GME but I hedged with CCs / sold some of my calls WAY TOO EARLY. **To put it into perspective, if I didn't touch my positions at all until today, I would have been around $3m, but as of now I'm only around $1.4m. Regardless, I am grateful!**

**January 2021** \- I've joined the 2 comma club officially! Finally hit my milestone.

**TLDR; made easy money on the rally after COVID in 4 months, lost it all in 3 days due to poor risk management and even went negative, briefly experienced depression and felt like $ROPEing, found a good company $GME, went all in with conviction, emerged stronger than ever.  üíéüôå  üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ  üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ  If I can do it, so can you.**

So here it is. 

&#x200B;

CRSR - Corsair Gaming

&#x200B;

Net Revenue for Q3 was $457.1 million - 60.7% increase year-over-year.

&#x200B;

Gross Profit was 127.9 Million an increase of 112% year-over year with gross margin of 28%.

&#x200B;

This was BEFORE Christmas, Black Friday, and winter break. These are going to skyrocket even further. 

&#x200B;

For Q4 The Preliminary Financial Results are as follows:

&#x200B;

Net Revenue to be about 1.7 Billion

&#x200B;

Net income was around 101 Million 

&#x200B;

The Market Cap for this stock is \~3.31 B and their Revenue for Q4 is half of that? Insane. I'm likely expecting it to be way over the estimations above just like when they doubled expectations the quarter before. All kids have  had to do all lockdown/winter break is play on their PC's, Consoles, and your wive's boyfriends PC. The floor for this is 35$ as shown by the past month and a half and It peaked at 51$. I have a price target of at least 55$ and possible 60$+ Corsair also owns Elgato.

&#x200B;

These numbers aren't going to drop either after COVID. When you invest this much money into a gaming setup for you or your child or whatever. They will keep putting money in. When their mouse breaks from smashing it after losing an online game like the baby they are. Or perhaps after they spill their Mountain Dew all over their mousepad? A lot of things that this pandemic has made us accustomed to are here to stay. I bought a bunch of CRSR Equipment a few years back and I still love it and have gifted the mousepads. I have bought every single dip the past month and I'm waiting for my big payday to mars   üöÄ     üöÄ     üöÄ  

&#x200B;

This is also just good long term if you don't want to play the options game (IV is really high right now premiums a bit much for my taste. 

&#x200B;

I listened into their last earnings call and they really know the esports industry and what to do with it. 

&#x200B;

They are expected to blowout earnings again. I sure as hell am not going to miss out on this like I missed on GME and partly BB.

&#x200B;

Obviously none of this is investment advice and please do your own DD. I'm just a brainlet with the robinhood app who gets high off gaming and gambling. 

&#x200B;

Positions: 305 Shares - I had 40$ Calls in December but took profits on them no longer holding.

TLDR at the bottom.** 

This has come up a few times, so as a non-finance professional I want to offer some financial non-advice to anyone who has just come into a lot of money and is considering paying off their student loans right now. 

[RIGHT NOW FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS ARE FROZEN](https://studentloanhero.com/featured/student-loan-relief-extended/) until September. You aren't obligated to repay until then, and no interest is accruing. 

**PAYING OFF ZERO-INTEREST DEBT EARLY IS FUCKING STUPID.** 

That means you have until September to allow your money to keep growing, either by investing (obligatory all investments carry risk disclaimer), saving in a boomer CD, or saving in a boomer high-yield savings account. Even if my GME tendies only grew by $100 between now and then, it's still the better financial decision to grow my money and pay later than pay now.

AM I GETTING THROUGH TO YOU SMOOTH BRAINS?

Even if you have a private loan, if your interest rate is LOW ENOUGH (like less than 5%), some people (not me because I'm not a financial professional) might even say it's better to keep your money somewhere where it earns more interest, instead of paying off your loans in full. This is called interest arbitrage. 

Congratulations on all the new tendies! But for the love of god please don't be the bad kind of stupid.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Paying off zero-interest debt early is stupid as shit. Find a way to let your money continue to grow until payments resume in September.

I‚Äôll tell you now that $GME was and is a historical moment and I‚Äôd like to congratulate all who were part of it and still continue to be. For those who don‚Äôt really know why $GME has been rising so drastically; it‚Äôs because of its short interest. $GME had a short interest of 138%, more than double the percentage of the next most shorted stock in all of the market. $GME is not a company that‚Äôs going to succeed, it was merely a play to get gains off a short squeeze, but you already knew that. The squeeze can still continue and may continue to do so, however the awareness of WSB is growing larger and larger very quickly. Which means more people will want to start taking their profits, and some will even try to continue to short $GME. It could only continue to rise if people do NOT sell and only more shares are bought, which is unpredictable. Just know that $GME is something that happens once in a blue moon and we‚Äôll be required to go back to our peasant 200% gains instead of 800%.

Which is why I‚Äôm here to give you the next best play, that focuses solely on predictability. Now it won‚Äôt cone as a surprise to say this ticker is $PLTR. I‚Äôm a longtime $PLTR holder but only because it proposes a huge opportunity if executed well, and slightly less significant opportunity if butchered. Either way, there‚Äôs opportunity.

IMPORTANT SECTION üöÄ:
Lockup is coming very very quickly, upon lockup ending insiders will be able to sell their shares for the first time since the stock has been $10. The stock has more than tripled and there‚Äôs no doubt that tons of positions will be sold. Currently $PLTR has 20% of shares available to be publicly traded and of that percentage; majority is held by the general public or retail investors (us). The other 80% of shares are being held in lockup by insiders and cannot be traded publicly until lockup ends. If chunks of these shares are sold upon lockup ending, and general public happens to claim majority of the 80% too, then we control the stock entirely. The only way this is possible is if everyone literally buys anything they can with everything they can right upon lockup ending. 

TL;DR: General public needs to control majority shares when insiders are finally able to sell their positions when lockup ends. We currently own majority of the 20% that‚Äôs publicly available.

A bunch of Asperger's, WoW playing, poor ""kids"" managed to cause an epic squeeze in $GME. Make no mistake you have the attention of the big boys NOW.

&nbsp;

Now an absolute giant in the hedge fund world has gotten in, and it is against WSB. Ken Griffin (he has a camera in his office that shows his luxury car collection in the garage) may not be a name you know, but he is  a HUGE name in the hedge and quant fund world. After today and likely tomorrow, he is at risk of losing 2 Billion plus in his fund. I repeat he will NOT let this happen.

&nbsp;

These are the type of guys who do insider trading for fun at their country club. They front run clients, put out fake news stories, have direct links to the SEC board, and would literally murder everyone in here to increase their personal wealth.

&nbsp;


**What to expect  from them next:**


1. Convince (strongarm) the SEC to completely HALT trading on GME. They will make up a bullshit excuse, and force the exchange to stop allowing trades on the stock.

2. Hire big name attorneys, and force reddit to shut down WSB   
3. Pressure $GME executives to issue NEW shares at this price, and bail the shorts out. This is pretty easy for them to do. You have to understand almost all the people at this level of wealth know each other. Its a small club. 

&nbsp;



**What can you do to stop this:**

1. Bring attention to their tactics via going to the media (Twitter, NYT, Senator Elizabeth Warren or the like)

2. File SEC complaints that show that NAKED short selling is happening on GME, and is creating an actual organic move. There are more shares SHORT than their are FLOAT (traded in every day trading). This means if they covered their shorts they would have to buy every single share outstanding, and another 30% that are not actively traded.

l5sno2||BlackBerry ($BB), Why you need it.|t3_l5sno2|0.86|1619|1619|top|2021-01-27 04:08:00.000000|DevantLaMachine|315|DD|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5sno2/blackberry_bb_why_you_need_it/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5sno2/blackberry_bb_why_you_need_it/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5sno2/blackberry_bb_why_you_need_it/|"I will keep this short to resume what BlackBerry ($BB) have to offer now in your portfolio. For more details, i will keep my sources at the end. (I'm really sorry about my english in this short DD, i'm from non-american country)

&#x200B;

**Great Expansion. /**

Since December, BB announced big surprises on the level of expansions of their company. 

7 December 2020 - We're talking about the co-development with **Amazon** of BlackBerry IVY,  a cloud-connected intelligent vehicle data platform.

25 January 2021 -  Partnership with **Baidu** of BlackBerry QNX, a software who's going to change the world of automobile. Used for a functional safety, a network security and reliability.  This announce about the creation of a good systems who can be implemted in every majors devices in long terms.

We're not talking about the OEM partners who are already with BlackBerry like **DELL** and **Infima**.

&#x200B;

**No Risk. /**

**192%** in **1 Month**, Looks alot if you see it this way. But is it really ?

Short Term - BlackBerry have an undervaluation for what it will come. The expansion of the company and the news who came since last year had a great impact. We think **192%** is a Pump and Dump, but the real answer is the road of 6$ to 19$ who is really small of what the company can really achieve. There is a large room to grow into in a short time if we think about the fact BB achieved **138$** in 2007. Why not 100$ ? They are still BlackBerry no ?

Medium Term - BlackBerry already announced 2 larges connections with giant companies in less than 2 months, they are ready for something or they need to make it big. That's where i want you to think, they will need to make the most connections in 2021 for installing their ''power'' in the market. Now we have BlackBerry who have a **100% success rate in safety and security certifications,** it will be a major change when it will be installed and known of every devices fabricants. And it will happen before 2022.

Long Term - The best one about me. We talk about BlackBerry, dealing additionnal co-operation with larges enterprise with the future already writed in their head. Their software and their utilisation worldwide will be not only huge, but attractive. The competition in this sector is old and not adjusted of what cyberattacks can come. BB already had the experiance of owning a large chunk of the market with Smartphones, do you really think it will be hard for them again ? Don't think 19 US$ is high if you think holding BlackBerry for years, it's a steal. literally.

&#x200B;

**BlackBerry Itself. /**

We're talking about the great expension BB has and about the international development of the software, but do you really know BlackBerry ?

Hacking, like this it looks not a big deal. But do you really know the impact it has ?

**12 May 2017** \- 80 Hospitals in England were affected by a Ransomware, writing patients on paper and pen

**July 2017** \- Equinax ,byberattack over **143 million American, Canadian and British customers** as well as **200,000 credit card numbers.** They had a simple vulnerability

**January 2021** \- Central Bank of New Zealand, security breach was found, 50 customers were affected. **20 YEARS OLD** software wasn't updated.

I could continue all night long about security software who are not updated or not enough fiable for today world. BlackBerry have, and will take, the advantage of making their presence in the market really soon, like we saw. What i really love about BlackBerry is that they don't stop innoving they product, they stopped working on their Smartphone for being full-time on what will come soon. They are extremely good in their domain and they will kill when coming in the market !

&#x200B;

BlackBerry re-invents itself, and you can join them.

&#x200B;

In Resume : BB best thing to buy now

**Retail does not want to be manipulated anymore.**

For decades Wall Street was manipulating securities, getting away with it, and blaming it on others. Through the media, bullshit target prices, naked short selling, or other forms of manipulation mentioned [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_manipulation) (Kenneth, [this one](https://www.ft.com/content/16cee174-3b7f-11ea-b232-000f4477fbca)'s for you). Citadel and many other MMs - don't misinterpret with Market Makers, we're talking about Market Manipulators here - got away with their dirty tactics to make shitload of money and screw people over. They finally got caught in their own game and tried everything to turn it around, but Shitron didn't work, the media didn't work, more aggressive selling didn't work. Now they're calling through some random crooks for regulations.

**BULLSHIT.** Regulation for what? Exchange of ideas? Our own Due Diligence? Winning against you in your own game? Yeah, in most cases your buddies at the SEC would gladly do so if you tell them anyway. This time though? People finally came to the realisation what the fuck you guys are doing over there. It was known by many since 2008 but people forgot quickly, and now is the time to remind them that you are no one else's friend but your crooked buddies.

I never thought I'd say this, but this community showed more leadership and guidance than any other media network. Providing knowledge, research, answers, many of you proven that **you are better people** than these fuckers with billions of dollars of AUM. You should be proud of yourselves as you are leading an unprecedented event in the history of finance. **Unprecedented.** This is why you should still guide others and be an example. Of course, we are not an entity and we will never be - just remember that you are a part of something great, maybe something that will change the way financial world operates, in a smaller or larger way. Remember that there are sharks among us who got pissed at the dirty games as well (shoutout to you Elon & Chamath). We are not alone.

They blame us? Let's blame them. They will lose all credibility sooner than later, not to mention this incoming generation. The media is here now, you still might convince my 80-year old grandpa that the internet is something out of Pandora's Box, but soon enough you won't be able to convince a single person. We are an important source of information for many people, and I'm not talking about WSB, but about the people that make it. Let's go there in the world and spread the facts.

Hence, dear Market Manipulators:

***Do not mislead again. Do not manipulate again. Get your facts straight. Retail matters, and you will see it.*** "|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001706.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['$GME', 'LSHIT', 'SEC', 'I', 'AUM', 'WSB']|['GME']

CenturyLink (LUMN) Lumen Technologies has been selected to help Nebraska transition onto their next generation 911 emergency system. By using this next generation emergency system it will help improve the delivery of emergency calls by not only allowing residences to voice call but also allowing them to send text messages, videos and pictures to emergency responders.

# CenturyLink signed 5 year contract with Nebraska Public Service Commission

They signed a contract with the State of Nebraska Public Service Commission which establishes a statewide Emergency Services Internet Protocol Network (ESInet) that serves approximately 70 PSAPs, with the goal of having all seven PSAP regions connected to the ESInet by the end of 2022. The contract, which Lumen had won previously, has an initial term of five years with five one-year options

# NG911 Features

Lumen's enhancements to its NG911 platform will provide new customers with a portal featuring a customer management dashboard with access to:

* a real-time view of the health of customer NG911 systems;
* the call path from origination through delivery to the public safety answering point (PSAP);
* component level monitoring, status, inventory and diagnosis; and
* reporting metrics.

When someone thinks a stock is going to go down or a company will go bankrupt, they can borrow shares from their broker to open a ""short"" position.  They then sell the shares immediately at the current market price.  They have a specified amount of time to return the borrowed shares to the brokerage.

If the stock does go down, the investor buys that number of shares at the now lower current market price, and then returns them to the broker.  He/she keeps the difference.

If the stock goes up, they have to ""cover"" their position.  They can ""buy-to-close"" whenever they want, but many of them will wait for a very long time because they are large firms who have a lot of money and leeway with their brokerage.  However, if a stock keeps going up and up, the brokerages can call the investor and demand the shares back to hedge *their* losses.  This forced buying drives the price up even more, which then causes other brokerages to make the same phone call to their clients, and so on and so forth.  This is called a ""short squeeze"".

\---

GameStop is a declining brick-and-mortar video game retailer.  Their management has not adapted to the digital world where many video games are downloaded instead of on discs.  They have been making some moves in the right direction, such as closing underperforming stores and paying down some debt, but they need to reinvent themselves to succeed.  Many large investors/firms have seen this coming and took out short positions a few years ago.  The stock kept going down so the brokerages and banks hadn't called yet. GME is the most-heavily shorted stock on the market.  More shares are shorted than are in circulation.  It's called ""naked short selling"", it's complicated, and some of it is probably illegal but the SEC looks away.

[Ryan Cohen](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890) founded Chewy.com when he was 25 and sold it six or so years later for $3.5 billion.  Last August, he purchased 9% of GME's shares.  When it was disclosed in the SEC filings, the stock went up 22% in a day (which is a LOT in normal circumstances).  The thought being that he was going to attempt to take over the company.  There was a lot of speculation online.  In late November he wrote a [strongly-worded letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf) to the Board of Directors.

Shortly before Christmas, he disclosed that he had bought more shares and now owns 12.9% of the company.  He bought the new shares at $16ish, after buying the first batch around $4.  When someone owns 10% or more of a company, there are heavy limitations on how much they can sell at one time, in a given period, and they have to disclose everything.

This signaled that he wasn't in it for a quick buck and he probably really was going to try to take over and modernize the entire company.  Gamestop has something like 55 million members in their club/newsletter thing, and that data can be used to make a lot of money through targeted advertising and such.   There have also been confirmed rumors that the company will be making a serious run at the fast-growing PC gaming market (many serious gamers build their own computers).  Video game competitions are also very popular and can be capitalized on.  The stock continued to slowly climb, with some sell-offs and such along the way.  It was not for the faint of heart.

Fast-forward to January 10th, when it was announced that Cohen and two of his board members from Chewy were officially appointed to the GameStop Board.  It was really looking like the theories from last fall were correct.  The news sent the stock soaring and the investors who had short positions were in big trouble.  Some of them started covering their debt, but many didn't and still haven't. The ones that did have incurred losses in the collective billions, and there are many more billions still out there that will be lost by short investors.

For the past two weeks, the pro-GameStop investors have shown great interest in the potential turnaround story of a store that plays a big role in their childhood memories.  With the presence of Cohen and his buddies from Chewy, an e-commerce giant, small investors can see that GameStop is now undervalued to those who believe in the new Board members.

The stock has been incredibly volatile as the large investment firms try to drive the price down.  One way they can do this by opening massive new short positions (AKA selling large chunks of shares all at once) as other shorts return their borrowed shares to the pool.  This can be seen many times along the daily charts of GME, in nearly vertical declines.  Knowing the potential of both Cohen and the short squeeze, small investors have been buying up all the dips.  If the shares are being held, and not sold, they are unavailable to be returned to brokerages. This drives the price up even MORE as the short investors scramble to buy whatever shares are available to fill their debt before the price continues to rise. Eventually someone is left holding the shares purchased at the highest possible price, but in this once-in-a-lifetime case, it probably won't be someone with a net worth under $100 million.

[I was one of the first to come out with a NOK DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l23du0/nokia_dd_one_way_trip_to_bonerville/) and I want you to listen closely. NOK is not the next GME. NOK is not the next TSLA. NOK is NOK. I gave a conservative PT of $10 EOY and I still stand by it, not what you gaylords translated to $10 EOW or some shit. Keep in mind, that‚Äôs still over a 100% gain, so tendies are there.

Looking at my previous DD, here‚Äôs how you should REALISTICALLY, and qualitatively, value $NOK:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;5G infrastructure giants‚Ä¶ with little Chinese competition thanks to Daddy Trump (RIP) banning Huawei, Nokia is in an oligopoly when it comes to 5G infrastructure.

* It takes a long time to build infrastructure, infrastructure that won‚Äôt pay out until later

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Which means‚Ä¶. they are the world‚Äôs 3rd largest telecoms equipment manufacturer

* 3rd largest, but still in a fiercely competitive landscape

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Nokia does a lot of patent licensing, meaning steady cash flow

* Nothing to say on this point

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Beyond telecommunications, they also work in imaging, sensing, Internet of Things, all the buzzwords

* These are all growing industries that show a lot of potential

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Recently new management

* They will be doing some cost cutting and strategic positioning. Cost cutting is immediate but strategy takes a while to materialize.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Government contract are also a sticky biz, and this is the coolest of them all:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Motherfuckers signed with NASA a $14M contract to install 4G on the moon. The company is going to the atmosphere, boys

* Let‚Äôs talk about gov‚Äôt contracts. NOK has a lot of them globally, they are usually paid out in installments They‚Äôre sticky business that provides consistency over the long term.

&amp;#x200B;

To address other concerns that have come up since:

* ‚ÄútHe fLoAt iS tOo BiG tO pUmP‚Äù Yeah no shit dude. WSB has such little influence to actually pump anything, plus if you want to dump it, it becomes illegal.
* **GME and BB Gang**, we are not trying to divide you. We are seeing opportunity elsewhere. Shut the fuck up and I‚Äôm rooting for you.
* **NOK Gang**, also shut the fuck up. Stop spamming and shit, actually present good arguments as to why NOK.
* Other DDs before and after me have been great and have done supplement research/brought up other points. Props to them. We‚Äôre a team in this!
* I jacked off before posting this and it was red. Mental note to see a doctor later.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Still a BULL but you retards need to ground your expectation, now everyone hates NOK because it didn‚Äôt throw up two days of 15% returns in a row like you shills said. Very bullish on NOK, but it is a LONG TERM play. I‚ÄôM NOT FUCKING SELLING. Suck my willy.

I'm simply sharing my own opinion and research. You are free to make up your opinion and decide to do whatever you want with your money.*

---------------------------

## **Status of GME 1/26. Why buying GME shares is a great idea.**

1. Elon Musk has been tweeting about GME. That brings **TSLA buyers** in, and a huge amount of wealth. What you saw in aftermarket was a glimpse of TSLA buyers.

2. **Wednesday will rally. Thursday will rally. Friday will be even crazier**. The $115 and $200 calls are very likely to expire ITM on Friday 1/29. Maybe even the newer 320 calls. This will trigger a gamma squeeze on Monday 2/1. Similar to the gamma squeeze of Monday 1/25!

3. **Shorts lost $5B today** 1/26 alone. Shares to borrow are rapidly tanking. Fees increasing. They are on their last rope. Older shorts are about to cover. Newer shorts probably just shit their pants. Melvin lost its $2.75B investment from yesterday (retards). Rumors of Melvin considering bankruptcy ahead of the short squeeze coming up -- they are about to lose their whole fund with the cover.


4. Again, the **gamma squeeze happening on Monday 2/1**. It's absolutely happening. Basically, this will force Market Makers to buy more shares of GME in order to cover for the 115$ and 200$ calls. More shares they buy, the less shares available to short. Meaning? SHORT SQUEEZE.

5. **Short squeeze is on the near horizon.** Could be this week/Friday. Next week. Or the week after. But the shorts are on their total last leg. Today was bloody for them.

So! Those 200c 2/19 calls look very yummy right about now. [320 calls](https://optionstrat.com/build/long-call/GME) are being released tomorrow as well. Just my opinion here.

I don't claim any knowledge. This is not investment advice. Do your own research, don't invest what you can't afford to lose, and if something feels wrong it probably is.* 

**TL;DR: This isn't about options (yet), it's about shares, and Institutional Investors are playing a dangerous game by convincing us (some of y'all have bought in without realizing it) that a magical short squeeze has some 3-day time limit, that Friday is somehow the end game, and are hoping that when investors don't see a $5,000 short squeeze by next week they will fold and take their gains at a ""reasonable"" double-digit stock price. Don't believe them. They can survive through mid-late February before the true short squeeze smashes upward. And I'll be ready. I like this stock and believe in it's long term potential, and I think it's undervalued.**



**THESIS:** If institutional investors can (1) convince retail investors to sell stock at low prices and (2) convince their lenders to wait, then the 0.01% get richer.



**JUSTIFICATION:** There is so much public sentiment (passion, enthusiasm, excitement, anger, whatever) surrounding short (~1 day) price movements*, and Friday's expiring options (these are also end of month contracts), that it seems like big clever money may be trying to artificially create a sort of bear trap for shareholders. 

Whatever happens in the next week or so (crest to $700? crash to $60?) almost means nothing in the long term, but could fool investors into giving these guys CHEAP ways out of their 140% float short interest positions. Remember, these are people who have been dumping tons of money for a long time, shorting the stock when it was *in the single digits*. They've been hoping for a GameStop bankruptcy, and manufacturing one as best they can. 



**IT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME:** Remember the VW infinite squeeze, where we saw **weeks** of crazy price movement before the actual peak. And that is a mild case, as most of the shares were held by an entity with legal, competitive, and strategic reasons and obligations forcing them to hold shares and **artificially reducing the float, or available shares for trading**. This reduced supply caused the short squeeze. 

However, this time around we've got a huge short interest, much much larger by comparison than that from VW's 2008 peak, to the tune of **140% of shares available for trading (float)**. They've massively overreached, and are going to pay the price for that. **But they haven't yet.**



**SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S A CHANCE:** This time, however, if the big dogs can shake shareholders hard enough, weak links break and paper hands fold and a fantastic long term play starts to seem out of reach. The market manipulation wins. 



**DARE TO BELIEVE:** Unfortunately for the shorts, GME has [real long term prospects](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) to revolutionize the gaming industry for consumers, and now has the attention and potential equity momentum (if they play it smart, which I think the new leadership will) to make this a reality. 

From that link above:
>In GME's case the rise in the stock price itself will likely result in fundamental improvements to the underlying economic metrics of the company. 

I believe. 

However, if the shorts can fight, sneak, manipulate, and otherwise adjust the share price down this week then they start to see light at the end of the tunnel. They make 2-3 week plans for doing the same thing. For them, prices don't have to bottom back out, they just have to convince enough people to sell that they buy thrmselves a few weeks before a short squeeze really takes them all under. 

*Some of this price movement is shorts covering, but much is actual legitimate investment between retail investors and other institutional investors who have seen the light. Remember, TSLA didn't get to where it is because one company made some bad short positions. But if GME shorts can convince everyone that a 3-day squeeze is all they get until GME crashes to some ""normal"" level, then they win. 

Everyone getting hyped about Friday is playing into their hands. Yeah maybe some will need to take gains after a Friday pop, but a smart long-term hold position on GME is what they're really afraid of. And I want to be a shareholder in GME's future, as many wanted to be with TSLA. And sure, maybe if everyone else thinks that way too, there may be an incidental short squeeze that wrecks the uber wealthy in mid-late February along the way. 

**Again, I am not claiming to be knowledgeable or insightful, just commenting my best guesses. Nobody knows the future. This is not investing advice.**

I just have a knack for explaining things and lots of people have asked about this topic so I thought I‚Äôd share my own personal thoughts.**

# The bull thesis

To date, the GME play has been pretty simple: buy and hold and wait for the squeeze, whether that comes in hours, days, or weeks. Try not to have a heart attack during the intermittent gamma squeezes, keep your hands diamond strong during the manipulated downward spikes, and buy baby buy.

It‚Äôs rapidly becoming apparent that we will soon enter the GME endgame. Before you can come up with an exit strategy or, if you‚Äôre still on the fence, decide whether to jump in, you need to form an opinion about the GME bull thesis, *without considering the short squeeze*. Your thoughts on the bull thesis will dictate how you play it from here on out.

One braindead simple way to calculate a fair stock price for a company is to use a ""times-revenue"" valuation. You take the company's revenue ($6.466B in 2020) and multiply by some magic number (often 0.5 for low-growth companies and 2 for high-growth companies), then divide by the float (number of shares available to trade, 50.65M). A times-revenue multiplier of 0.5 gives a GME stock price of $64, while a multiplier of 2 gives $255.

This isn't a particularly sophisticated method but whatever, I'm not a particularly sophisticated investor.

Working backwards, if Melvin Capital thinks that GME is overpriced at $20 then a times-revenue valuation would suggest a multiplier of 0.16. That's extraordinarily low for a retail business. If you applied that multiplier to Best Buy ($43B revenue in 2020, 231.59M float) you would get a stock price of $30. Best Buy currently trades for $115, which works out to a much more reasonable multiplier of 0.62.

What multiplier is correct? Well, the bulls point out:

* Ryan Cohen (13% stake in GME, sits on the board) has a great e-commerce success story with Chewy, his previous company.
* Three new successful e-commerce board members from Cohen's firm were added to the board in 2020.
* Despite being a brick-and-mortar business and the pandemic, Gamestop's balance sheet isn't bad. They have approx. $550M in debt, but more than that in cash (net cash positive). They have minimal risk of default or bankruptcy in the near future, even without any change to company direction.
* Their traditional core business of game and console sales is not shrinking as fast as many people expected, with major new consoles still supporting optical discs and digital game downloads not accelerating as fast as feared, possibly due to stagnation in the ISP industry. So even if Cohen and his board seats take a long time to roll out new changes, the company is in little danger of any sudden spiral.

So is Melvin right and GME is a dead-end company with no growth potential and should be valued with a times-revenue multiplier vastly below its competitors? Or is it more appropriate to think of it as a brand new business, being spring-boarded off the healthy books of an existing brand by a successful e-commerce businessman alongside a revamped board?

How you judge that determines your exit strategy.

# Exit strategy 1: Just along for the ride

Maybe you don't care at all about GME's balance sheet or Cohen's planned turnaround, you bought a couple shares on a whim to be part of a unique movement. You don't intend to be a long-term Gamestop shareholder nor do you really care if you miss out on the highest peaks, so long as you make a few dollars and get to say you were part of the squeeze.

If I were this person, what would I do? I'd pick a number between 0 and 3 that I feel represents my confidence in the retail market's current expectation for Cohen and GME, and multiply it by 128. I'd submit a limit sell order for all my shares at that share price.

# Exit strategy 2: Pants-shitting fear

You've got a handful of shares and maybe some options and you're up big. You don't know much about squeezes or fundamentals or greeks and every time there's a dip and the stock gets halted you shit your pants and your finger hovers over the sell button. But then the price jumps up and you wipe the drenching sweat off your face and promise to hold firm next time.

If I were this person, what would I do? I'd sell all my options that expire sooner than 30 days at market open to reduce the number of pairs of pants I'm going through. I'd keep all my shares and longer-dated options until the news comes out that the shorts are being liquidated. And I'm not watching hedge fund managers get on Fox Business or CNBC or whatever, I'm following WSB and Twitter for rapid fire updates about short volume. If the short volume as reported by WSB posters drops below, say, 50% I'm selling everything and getting out. I might also pick a maximum times-revenue multiplier (something pretty high, like 4 or 5) and use that for a limit sell for shares.

# Exit strategy 3: Diamond hands

You've got bigger balls than most, and this isn't your first time dumping a significant fraction of your net worth into a company whose financials you've never looked at. You want to ride it to the peak, if at all possible, and you want to impress the pants shitters and the weak-kneed with your maximum gains. You are ok with increasing your cost basis to squeeze out extra tendies on the way to the top.

If I were this person, what would I do? I'd sell my weeklies on open tomorrow and immediately plow every dollar of those 20-bagger returns into shares. If my longer-dated options were purchased at extreme IV I'd do the same for them, otherwise I'd let them ride. I wouldn't sell a single share until the final squeeze, when news comes out that Melvin is done, and then I'd unload (in my pants). See you on the moon, brother.

# Exit strategy 4: u/DeepFuckingValue

IF HE'S STILL IN I'M STILL IN

# FAQ 1: Is it too late to get in?

The best way to judge this is by looking at the exit strategies. Which person are you? If you're (1) then sure, buy a share or two to be part of a once-in-a-decade event, but think of it as a fun expense - a ticket to ride the squeeze train - not an investment. If you're (2) then hell yeah buy those shares baby but avoid options unless there's a dip. If you're (3) or (4) then you're already in and lying to your wife about how deep.

# FAQ 2: Was that the squeeze?! Is it over?

This must get posted every time there's a gamma squeeze. It's midmorning and price suddenly launches into the stratosphere, trading halts, and it crashes back down. No, that wasn't *the* squeeze. Gamma squeezes occur when options prices are rising (due to sudden increased options buying or volatility) faster than market makers can hedge. They're good to get your heart racing but a short squeeze is slower and more stable.

# FAQ 3: How high will it go during the squeeze?

Who knows. $500? $1000? $2000? There's really no way to know. If you have the stones to get those max tendies then you should focus on listening to the emerging news about Melvin Capital and Citadel rather than watching the price. Sell when they're covering and not a moment before. That will be the peak.

# FAQ 4: How long will this take?

Could be tomorrow morning, could be tomorrow afternoon, could be next week. At the rate that shorts are losing money it won't be much longer than that. If you're not in yet, this is the final boarding call.

# FAQ 5: Who will buy our shares at the peak?

The idea behind selling at the peak isn't to sell your shares to another retail trader, but to sell your shares to the desperate short sellers who are forced by their prime brokers to liquidate their positions at any cost. That's the difference between a perfectly legal and time-honored short squeeze and a pump-and-dump. This isn't about irrationally driving the price upwards with the hopes of selling to a bigger idiot, it's about buying and holding and waiting for the shorts to crack and beg us to sell to them.

# FAQ 6: What is the next stock?

Get this thought out of your head. Yeah you just joined WSB and made a few bucks and now you think you found yourself an investment club. **No**. This is a forum for folks to share their risky trade ideas, not a place to coordinate to manipulate the market. Yes, at the moment the consensus is that we can make a boatload of money off of dumbass hedge funds, but think of it less like a pack of draft horses following a path and more like a room of angry, shitting monkeys who happen, for the time being, to be throwing their shit in the same direction.

# FAQ 7: Am I gay?

Many of us grow up to assume that we‚Äôre straight only to find out, later, that we‚Äôre not. Sometimes, we realize this because we have sex dreams, sexual thoughts, or feelings of intense attraction toward people of the same gender as us. However, none of those things ‚Äî sex dreams, sexual thoughts, or even feelings of intense attraction ‚Äî necessarily ‚Äúprove‚Äù your orientation. There are a few different forms of attraction. When it comes to orientation, we usually refer to romantic attraction (who you have strong romantic feelings for and desire a romantic relationship with) and sexual attraction (who you want to engage in sexual activity with). Sometimes we‚Äôre romantically and sexually attracted to the same groups of people. Sometimes we‚Äôre not. For example, it‚Äôs possible to be romantically attracted to men but sexually attracted to men, women, and nonbinary people. This sort of situation is called ‚Äúmixed orientation‚Äù or ‚Äúcross orientation‚Äù ‚Äî and it‚Äôs totally OK. Bear this in mind as you consider your sexual and romantic feelings.

- Stop messaging me asking what you should do. Yes, Melvin Capital has been reported to have covered. You have to decide for yourself whether the squeeze is underway or complete and you should exit or whether you want to hold out for more, or take some profits and hold, or whatever. I just gave you a rough guide and some explanation of different thought processes, you have to make the call for yourself.

The little kids that have been bullied by the big boys are finally saying enough is enough. But that is not what this post is about. 

This post is an appreciation and a thank you for saving a part of my childhood. I remember when I was only a little autist of young age, my excitement to visit the mall had always been to rush towards the little Gamestop they had next to the foot locker and nike store over at the end of Hall B. Id drag my mom over and what I was entering wasnt a store full of fat hairy nerds in sweatpants but a fantasy land full of bright colors, every game imaginable for sale, gaming magazines with demo discs, console stations to play for hours on, anything that a simple autistic boy like me would be into. While Im older now and rarely get the same hype as I did back then, I still visit a Gamestop once in awhile and enjoy the nostalgia. I know many kids continue to experience the same thrill of entering a Gamestop with their parents (which are probably you guys now) today as I did back at a young age. I‚Äôm in tears knowing that we are saving an important part of our childhood and allowing the potential for Gamestop to evolve into a 21st century Cultural Spot where everyone that enjoys games and collecting can gather. 

These Hedgefunds that bully the weak and manipulate the markets to profit off of making companies go bankrupt and job losses should be ashamed of themselves. They are attempting to destroy a piece of history in our childhoods and those in the making, we are saving it. Stay strong üíéüíéüöÄüöÄüí™üèªüí™üèª.

Apparently, Citadel knows best and they can just manufacture shares. But not to worry, because these large banks will just get a bailout on tax payer money just like they did when they were selling credit default swaps and fraudulently manipulating the housing market. So while now it's $5B, it could very well be $10B next week or even $20B because they just have free money from the Fed.

Highlights of DD:

* With at least 71.2M shares shorted as of Dec. 31 and now likely at least 78M (a 10% increase), this means that deep pockets are ready to play and play big (e.g. willing to go up to -$20B).
* With only -$5b in losses, it would require another 500% increase from what it is today to push the shorts out, that's $1,000. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
* With so much equity growth, it has enough capital to do eliminate debt entirely, reinvest in a newer and better business model, and prove that they can actually earn this money back plus some allowing it's fundamentals to increase to the value it's been raised to. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
* I would be utterly shocked if it did not split at $400 back down to $50 to allow more ramp up. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Here's a graphic summary (couldn't embed in post):

&#x200B;

**Clarify - What is a Stock Split**: Stock split doesn't mean that you lose value. If the stock splits at $400 at an 8:1 ratio, that means for every 1 share you have, you will now have 8 shares. So if you buy 50 shares tomorrow at $200 for a total of $10k and the stock rises to $400, you still have 50 shares with a value of $20k. But then it splits at 8:1, you will have 400 shares (50\*8) and the price will be adjusted to $50 still keeping the same value of $20k. The shares shorted will increase as well so the shorts will have the same outstanding obligation and will have to buy back the same amount in $$$ to cover their position. Options holdings are adjusted and strike prices adjust so you control the same amount of $$$ too. This just makes it easier for more retail investors to get in adding more üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ.

### Shorting

**How It Works**

Most traditional (i.e. boomer) investors usually try to make money by going long - i.e. ‚Äúbuy low and sell high‚Äù; this is when you buy a stock thinking it will go up in the future (bullish). Shorting is the opposite of this, you ‚Äúsell high and buy low‚Äù, thinking the stock will go down in the future (bearish). This is usually done through the broker, where the prospective short seller would ‚Äúborrow‚Äù the shares from them, and they would need to pay back these shares in some future date by ‚Äúcovering their shorts‚Äù - or buying back the exact same quantity of shares they owe the broker.

For example, imagine that there were only 10 Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards in the world. Because nobody wants to deal with taking physical possession of these cards and risk losing their Pokemon card in their laundry or something, everyone pays a Pokemon card dealer a small fee to store it for them. Through their dealer, you can buy and sell these Pokemon cards as well. A üåàüêª realizes that maybe Pokemon cards are dumb and borrows 2 Surprised Pikachu cards (who has a prearranged agreement with some institutional Pokemon card hoarder to loan them out for interest) and sell them for $420 each, thinking that they're actually work $100 at most, and plans to buy the Pokemon cards back at that price to repay his Pokemon card loan (i.e. covering their shorts) - this is a short sale. Since no one actually wants to physically hold these Pokemon cards, these cards physically stay with the dealer who could then lend out these exact same Pokemon card if the buyer also has an agreement to allow them to do so. This means that you can actually have people owing more than the total number of Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards in existence (i.e. short interest > 100%).

Replace ‚ÄúSurprised Pikachu Pokemon card‚Äù with stocks and ‚ÄúPokemon card dealer‚Äù with ‚Äúbroker‚Äù and you have a short sale of shares. Interestingly enough, this also applies 80% to how banks work as well.

**Short Squeezes**

So when does a short seller need to cover their shorts? Well, either when a) The short seller wants to, either to take profit or to stop a loss, b) Their broker forces them to through a margin call, or c) The broker forces them to as the broker has recalled their loan, usually for a hard to borrow stock - they get ‚Äúbought in‚Äù. Today, we‚Äôll focus on C) because this is how short squeezes happen.

So, what does a broker recalling their loan mean? Well, to go back to the Pokemon card example, imagine that the dealer only has 6 Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards that he‚Äôs legally allowed to loan out. Some more üåàüêª short sells all the 6 remaining Pokemon cards until the dealer has no more available on hand. So what happens when someone wants to buy a Surprised Pikachu Pokemon Card and doesn‚Äôt want the dealer to lend out their cards? He‚Äôll have to force one of those üåàüêª to buy back the card that they owe them so the dealer can give it to the prospective buyer. But who can the üåàüêª buy back the card from? The dealer. But the dealer doesn‚Äôt have any cards to sell, so they need to force another üåàüêª to cover so that the former üåàüêª can cover their shorts. This vicious cycle repeats and leads towards a sudden surge in demand for Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards and a spike in prices for it - a short squeeze.

**The Institutional Factor**

One thing alluded above was that shares can only be borrowed from \*some\* share holders, but not all. So who exactly can and does a broker typically borrow these shares from? These are usually margin accounts of either institutional and sometimes (although much less frequently) retail investors. Usually, when an entity signs a margin agreement, which allows them to borrow either cash or shares from the broker, they give permission to the broker to also lend out their shares in the process, and thereby also give up their voting rights - in case you‚Äôve ever wondered who actually the share \*actually\* belonged to in shareholders meetings. Since almost every institution except Warren Buffet uses margin to a certain extent, and not that many retail investors do, especially given that retirement accounts are forbidden to use margin, and it‚Äôs much easier to ‚Äúfind‚Äù one big source of TSLA shares from one big institution with a margin account rather than find thousands of smaller margin retail accounts who hold TSLA shares, so most of the time, these shares are being borrowed from an institution (i.e. pension fund, hedge fund). This means that shares that are almost disproportionately held by retail investors are much harder to short because they‚Äôre harder to borrow from the broker, and retail-heavy stocks like HTZ, GME, NIO, and NKLA, which virtually no institutions actually hold, will demand high interest rates when shorting and the sellers can much more easily be forced to cover during a short squeeze.

### Stock Options

**What are Stock Options**

A stock option is a contract between the writer and whoever holds it that gives the option holder the right to buy (call option) or sell (put option) 100 shares of the underlying stock on or before the expiry date at a specified strike price. So for example, buying a GME 1/29 $1000c gives whoever the holder of this contract is the option to buy from the writer of this contract 100 shares of GME at $1000 / share on or before 1/29. Obviously if GME is lower than $1000 before that date, the holder would be an idiot to exercise this option to buy GME shares for more than their current market value, so they expire worthless.

This effectively provides the option holder an immense amount of leverage, and provides the opportunity for them to 10x or even 100x their original investment if the underlying asset moves the right way - for example because a subreddit declares war on a hedge fund and pumps up a stock to make them go bankrupt, while limiting their losses to the cost of the option. The option writer will in return receive a premium for the option, potentially risking an infinite amount of money, but with a high likelihood of making a small profit. These writers would either be

1. Theta gang - who are looking to generate a tidy income source from those option premiums and pray that the stock doesn‚Äôt move in the wrong direction too much
2. A market maker - who writes the contract when they see an arbitrage opportunity between the market value of an option and the theoretical value of it, and hedging their contract they wrote by buying / shorting the underlying assets so they effectively don‚Äôt actually take a position in the market.

We‚Äôll go over how 2) works and how this mechanism can be used as a financial nuclear bomb, but first you need to learn some greek. 

**The Greeks**

The greeks in finance is a set of factors that can affect the price of a stock option / group of options

Delta - Change of the option price as the stock price changes

Gamma - Change in Delta as the stock price changes

Vega - Change in the option price as volatility of the stock changes

Theta - The decay in the option price as the expiration date gets nearer

Rho - Change of the option price as the interest rate changes; Most people ignore this

Looking at the greeks of the gambling tickets you buy is very useful to analyzing the ways you can make or lose money on them. Think TSLA will go up a modest amount? Buy a high-Delta call. Think GME is going to üöÄüöÄüöÄ 1000% more? Look for a high Gamma call so your Delta gains accelerate as GME üöÄüåï. Do you feel like a vampire and want to have a steady income source from degenerate r/wallstreetbet gamblers on a stock you think will go flat (relative to historical volatility) over the next few months? Join theta gang and sell a high-Theta and high-Vega option!

**Market Makers**

The Black-Scholes model is a fancy mathematical model that describes a ‚Äúperfect price‚Äù (a lot of caveats here) for a stock option. This is done by showing how every option written can theoretically be perfectly hedged by a series of purchases or short sells on the underlying stock. This means that theoretically, if there is a large gap between the theoretical price from Black Scholes and the actual price for an option, there is an ‚Äúarbitrage‚Äù opportunity - this is where market makers come in.

Market makers are companies that provide liquidity to a market by offering to be counterparty to trades. This is especially useful in stock options, where a single ticker can have thousands of options, and there might be someone who wants to buy a GME 1/29 $1000c but no one is actually actively selling it. However, this option might be listed anyways and Citadel will sell you the call if anyone tries to buy it and then immediately hedge it. In fact, when you buy an option chances are you‚Äôre not actually buying it from its previous owner selling an option they already own, but from a market maker like Citadel (who is responsible for over 99% of all options volume in 3000 stocks).

So what happens when someone buys an option from a market maker? Since the market maker typically can‚Äôt (and probably don‚Äôt want to) take a position, meaning taking a directional bet if a stock goes up or down, they‚Äôll immediately hedge the option they just conjured out of thin air by buying or shorting the equivalent number of shares such that the Delta of those shares is the same as the Delta of the option they wrote to remain Delta-neutral, so if the stock goes up or down their position value doesn‚Äôt change - this is called **Delta hedging**. Furthermore, as the stock price moves up (calls) or down (puts), they‚Äôll need to buy or sell even more of those shares to remain Delta neutral since the Delta will change due to the option‚Äôs Gamma - this is called **Gamma hedging**.

### Putting It All Together - How options can be used as weapons of mass destruction against short sellers

Now we have the tools to understand how these two financial concepts put together can make billion-dollar hedge funds go bankrupt. Through Delta and Gamma hedging of market makers, buyers can have the effect of buying shares dozens of times the value they actually spent buying their option; a XYZ 4/20 690c can cost only $100 in premiums but causes the market maker to buy $2000 in the underlying stock to hedge against it. If you get enough retail investors to do this, they'll have the impact of billion-dollar whales on the market despite their small stimulus-check-funded portfolios.

Now, you do this on a stock that is heavily shorted, and with very little institutions actually holding real shares of these - making it harder for brokers to find shares to borrow, and you have yourself a weapon of mass financial destruction capable of making billions of Melvin‚Äôs money disappear in a single day and potentially have GME üöÄüöÄüöÄ to a trillion dollar market cap.

The one thing that‚Äôs interesting about all of this is r/wallstreebet‚Äôs unique position in being able to facilitate this weapon of mass financial destruction because

1. Most rich people or institutions too risk adverse to buy large amounts of out of the money options (unless you're Chamath or Elon)
2. This can only really happen on stocks that very few institutions (i.e. rich people) actually own, meaning it needs to be held / bought on mass by retail investors
3. In any other scenario where 1 and 2 happen to be true, this would be classified as market manipulation and be immediately shut down by the SEC

**My Positions**

r/wallstreetbets veterans may recognize me as the üåàüêª who wrote those long-ass 2000 word essays about how the [stock market is in a bubble](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) and loaded up on VIX calls last time you heard from me. Although I still stand by my thesis and stocks like GME, TSLA, and NKLA is just proof that we've reached the euphoria phase of it, I learned my lesson that I'm idiot trying to short it (for exactly the reasons described above) and got the fuck out of my position when VIX shot up back in Sept. Most of my ""real money"" has since been moved to gold and crypto, but because I'm a degenerate gambler, I still have a bit of money playing with /ES and a **calls on** [highly-shorted stocks](https://www.highshortinterest.com/) **with meme-stock potential** (i.e. vast majority held by retail investors). Now that I'm busy with work again, I probably won't be posting as frequently as I have had in the past, but you'll see me around from time to time :)."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001727.csv|StockTicker|['DDDD']|[]|['$GME', '$BB', '$BBRY', 'DDDD', 'A', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'HTZ', 'GME', 'NIO', 'NKLA', 'A', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'A', 'TSLA', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'XYZ', 'GME', 'SEC', 'VIX', 'I', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'NKLA', 'I', 'VIX', 'I', 'ES', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'BBRY', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'HTZ', 'GME', 'NIO', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'TSLA']

No I‚Äôm not trying to kiss ass, but what y‚Äôall are doing is incredible.

I‚Äôve been a member for over a year now, and seeing the huge influx of people (and massive media attention) made me realize that you all are  the ones who are having to keep this thing under control. We are in some crazy times over here at WSB and I know you all have been work overtime on here and it‚Äôs for free. I hope I speak for all of wsb when I say we truly appreciate the work you all put in. I also want to add that if there is a full blown attack on this sub, that you all can lead us out of it. I know it‚Äôs a lot to ask for but hell, half of us can‚Äôt read or write. We need you guys and even if we do get spammed with some bullshit posts from 2 month old bots, I‚Äôm okay with that as long as you guys can keep this sub up and running. This place feels like home and it‚Äôs brought a lot of good into a crazy world right now. The GME train will eventually end when it reaches Pluto, but I need this sub to continue on. I need the loss porn of someone who maxed out their credit cards and yoloed it at the top just like I need the gain porn of a teenager who helped pay for a new roof. WSB is bigger than a sub on Reddit, its a beacon of hope in a dark world and I think with blood, sweat, tears, cocaine, and autism this place is going to change a lot people‚Äôs lives.

Melvin Capital reduced GME to $4 and held it under their thumb for a YEAR. I thought they had unwound on Monday and I was wrong.  They have 5 fucking years of puts and shorts of this stock.

**As Jim Cramer asked on CNBC just this week: Why didn't they just take their profit?  What was their goal? Bankrupt them?** Well Jim, I think they could have pushed that at any point between July 2019 and July 2020. So why hold it down for a year at their expense?  Do they fucking shop these companies out for takeovers?

There was a post earlier today about the largest individual shareholder - Donald Foss - [a self made billionaire who created his fortune financing used cars sales to underqualified buyers with pre-installed kill switches to ensure they paid their loans with brutal interest or faced next day repos and overpriced lawsuits](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/04/car-subprime-bubble-auto-loans-credit-acceptance-don-foss/) - now owns roughly 5% of Gamestop and that he looked like a ""jovial"" old man and must be pleased that his 5% purchase of Gamestop now worth $750million Dollars.  Some commented how it must have been a genius play or ""maybe he saw the DFV reddit posts"" or maybe he's just the luckiest boomer who decided to get into the Gaming Retail Space for Retirement Homes.  

This bugged the shit out of me to the point I should have been in bed 5 hours ago. Why the fuck would a ""billionaire"" 75yr old invest $14 Million in Gamestop on February 28, 2020 as a global pandemic was already unfolding and the impending economic impacts were already clear for anyone looking ahead?

Donald Foss is still an insider, theres a pepe silvia trail.  In 2015, the CACC stock was heading down, quite frankly resembling a sustained short attack. It had just run into some legal trouble, so maybe it was a good target to short? Maybe one of the Scumbag-Asshole-Cohert Trading Firms was doing just that?

[On October 23, 2014, roughly a month after Melvin Capital is started by Gabe Plotkin, Donald Foss sells 430,967 shares of CACC trading at $125.54 for $54million.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000120919114064903/xslF345X03/doc4.xml) 
Gamestop was trading at $34.  

[On December 31 2014 Donald Foss reports using 320,000 shares valued at $44.8 Million as collateral for a loan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000088555015000021/fosssc13g20141231.htm)

In the 3rd quarter of 2015, Melvin Capital buys puts on GME. I don't have the value of puts in 2015, but in 2018 those puts were amounted to $17,395,000.   
[On December 31 2015 Donald Foss reports using 570,000 shares valued at $114Million as collateral for a loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000088555016000086/fosssc13g20151231.htm)

**In the 3rd Quarter of 2015, Gamestock shares crash 67% from $41 to $28** Most likely because of poor fundamentals.

In 2016 Donald Foss does not touch his shares of CACC. 2015/2016 was a year of hot water for CACC. Game Stop barely moves trading the whole year from $28 - $25  

[On December 31 2017 Donald Foss reports using 220,000 shares valued at $71.5 Million as collateral for a loan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000114420418008911/tv486077_sc13ga.htm)
Gamestop is now trading at $18

[On December 31 2018 Donald Foss reports using 220,000 shares valued at $82.5 Million as collateral for a loan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000114420419007123/tv513133_sc13ga.htm) 
Gamestop is now trading at $12

In 2019 Donald Foss does not touch his shares of CACC.

**In June 2019, u/DEEPFUCKINGVALUE opens $55,000 worth of 18 month Call options on GME**
**In August 2019, Dr Michael Burry reports a significant purchase of GME**

[On February 28, 2020, Donald Foss purchases 3,515,200 shares, a 5.3% ownership stake, of Gamestop for $14 Million](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/901185/000110465920030651/tv538831_sc13g.htm) **Pure speculation, but Donald Foss most likely purchases this stake as he is a BIG FAN OF THE STOCK, out of every other stock on the market, this is the only one he has significantly invested into in the past 5 years.**
[In 2020 Melvin Capital has puts amounted to $55,080,000.](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link). 
Gamestop is trading at $4.

[From March 2020 until July 2020 - Donald Foss begins liquidating 250,000 shares of his CACC to the tune of $95,207,250, in the most unprecedented manner from his holdings, all while CACC stock price is fluctuating all over the place due to Rona + Fed Kangaroo Markets. These payments were coming out every couple days in quantities of 6000 - 10000 shares.](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0000901185&type=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0&count=40) 

**Where is this fucking money going??? It would have been enough to buy another 24million shares *to try to* increase his total holding to 38 Million shares, or over 51% of the 69.75Million float**  

In August 2020, Gamestop hits $5. Data available to me and my will to keep typing is gone.  *Did Foss continue to liquidate CACC into August/Sept?*

Everyone on the fucking planet knows where Gamestop is now.

TODAY CACC MOVED *closely* IN LINE WITH GME ATTACKS.  CACC STOCK HAS NEVER BEEN DECLARED IN A  13F BY MELVIN CAPITAL.  CACC STOCK IS BEING USED AS A LOAN OR SOMETHING BY FOSS THOUGH.  MELVIN USED ALL HIS OTHER DECLARED STOCKS IN THE ATTACKS WITH HEAVY SELL VOLUMES PRECEDING PRICE BOMBS.

Why does this look like a hostile takeover play that took 5 fucking years and they fucked up?? Why wouldnt the guy that invested $14M thats now worth $750M talk to the media AT ALL? What the fuck does he want Gamestop for at 75 yrs old?! And it took 5 fucking years to execute?!

TL;DR Did Deepfuckingvalue prevent a 5year vulture capitalism play? WTF?  SEC Give me Award.

Based on technical fundamentals and the hard lesson I‚Äôve learned from WSB after at some point betting against GME and learning to be a bull. 

Reasons why to invest in AMC:

1) DON‚ÄôT bet against üíéü§≤üèª ppl because you may have small wins but will suffer big losses like I did by betting against them. 

2)GME ppl may be upset at this but I believe AMC actually offers a service you can‚Äôt get anywhere else unless you‚Äôre willing to wait months or a year to watch the latest movies. 

3) PRECOVID ppl were still going to the movies and spending money at the theaters. PRECOVID guidelines destroyed the stock price

4)PRECOVID the stock normal price was about $30-35. I expect as the states open up and COVID becomes the next flu and actors start making new movies, people will flood back to the movie theaters after being away for so long. THUS, AMC will start making money and the stock price will KEEP GOING UP

5) Even with offerings and üåàüêª, AMC is a established company and BANKRUPTCY BEING OFF THE TABLE, make this a  STRONG LONG HOLD üöÄüöÄ

6) I don‚Äôt believe this will have that many üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ as GME because it‚Äôs not shorted over 100% 

7) Based on technical fundamentals and the new WSB fundamentals people are learning, AMC current price is a bargains and will definitely üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ and destroy the üåàüêª that are shorting from $5-30"|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001809.csv|StockTicker|['AMC']|['AMC']|['$AMC', 'SAFE', 'LONG', '$GME', 'WSB', 'GME', 'T', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'AMC', 'COVID', 'COVID', 'COVID', 'I', 'COVID', 'THUS', 'AMC', 'KEEP', 'GOING', 'UP', 'AMC', 'UPTCY', 'BEING', 'OFF', 'THE', 'TABLE', 'TRONG', 'LONG', 'HOLD', 'I', 'GME', 'WSB', 'AMC']|['AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'GME', 'AMC']

People view $AMC the same way they view $GME - just another brick & mortar Mall company that is essentially being destroyed by $AMZN Prime, HBO Max, and Disney+. Fair enough, but I enjoy watching a new release in IMAX with a flatbread pizza in one hand, and a flavored Coke in my other. I think many others do to.

To address everyone who doesn't care about IMAX or going to theaters, $AMC has to simply do ONE VERY SIMPLE THING that will literally blow the minds of the un-imaginative analysts who are predicting doom.  All $AMC has to do is rename ""**AMC Theatres On Demand**"", the program they started in 2019, to **AMC+**.

AMC+ will be a studio-independant platform for movies, documentaries and TV shows. No monthly fee, but rather an revenue-sharing a la carte pricing system. Of course I'd love to see $AMC poach some talent from $NFLX or $DIS when they announce AMC+. One can dream!

TL;DR- $AMC can pivot hard by simply relaunching their existing ""AMC Theatres On Demand"" to AMC+.

AMC is the largest movie theater chain in the country. The pandemic has hurt small business, movie theaters included. The pandemic has concentrated market share on the biggest players, meaning AMC now dominates more of the pie. 

Theaters aren't going away anytime soon. Nicholas Christakis predicted in Apollo's Arrow that we will see a Roaring 20s after the vaccine. The Roaring 20s will see theaters and movie industry boom just like it has historically. Media companies will release a floodgate of movies and demand will be sky high for a while. 

AMC is poised to capture most of that demand and growth, especially given its recent investments into upgrading theaters. Imagine the hype coming from higher demand, tons of stimulus money, and backed up releases. 

300 shares $AMC @ 5.10

TLDR

The largest theater chain in the country will gobble up the remains of the weaker business that couldn't survive the pandemic. AMC will gain a greater share of the pie for greater long term growth. Roaring 20s will see business boom. AMC to the moon. 

And buy the dip! Going right back to $23.

I have better data supporting this, just on mobile right now. Will update with figures. BTW, check Google trends today, AMC tops the results!

Turns out he needed knee surgery that costed $4,000.00. I broke down because I didn't have that much, didn't qualify for the payment plan, and it was either the surgery or wait till his other knee blew out then put him to sleep.

I put all the money I did have in GME around $97/ share & AMC at $4.84 Tuesday morning (a little less than $1k) with an exit plan to get out once I had enough for his surgery.

&#x200B;

**DD:**

1. BBBY is one of the highest shorted stocks following GME with a 84 short percentage of float
2. The CEO who turned around Target joined BBBY in Nov 2019, since then, he had kicked out and replaced all original C-Suite
3. BBBY has been transforming and selling all non-core business for profitability and better liquidity
4. The company announced a $675 Million share buyback in the next 3 years, given current share price, that will reduce the amount of shares by 15%, which essentially making BBBY another more than 100% shorted company
5. Guess who also shorts BBBY? Yeah fucking Melvin. Read their 13F, as of Nov 2020, the $ amount of their BBBY short positions is actually higher than their GME short positions. When they are forced to liquidate their positions, BBBY will be short-squeezed as well

BBBY is like the little brother of GME. There is no conflict between buying BBBY and GME, it is another way to fuck Melvin without paying extreme high premiums on GME calls.

Never posted because I just like lurking the sub. All of this talk of GME recently has left the sub feeling one dimensional and seems to discourage other potential winning stocks. 

People seem to think everything is a comparison to GME. It isn't. Some people want to invest in BB because it looks more promising with it's tech and pivoting market strategy. Some people want AMC because it tanked due to a pandemic and they want to keep the largest movie theater chain alive or see the potential in recovery. (AMC was over $30 pre-COVID.)

There are many posts discouraging or dissuading people from investing in other companies, but particularly those 2. Yes I'm on the GME rocket üöÄüöÄüöÄ. But that doesn't mean I can't make other healthy investments that have potential too.

Inflation adjusted Silver should be at 1000$ instead of 25$. Link to post removed by mods.

Why not squeeze $SLV to real physical price.

Here he goes---


Hi master!!
In our debate about of which ETF is the best for our purposes (PSLV or SLV) I think that obviously the choice is SLV. Many people try to discredit it putting in doubt that it holds all the silver that it should, but I think that this had been always biased propaganda by the bullion dealers. SLV is run by BlackRock, who has many, many, many more assets under management than the SLV (in fact SLV is one of their smallest funds). Will such a leader of the investment industry put its reputation in risk???
Some years ago (in the darknest recent age of silver, about 2013-2015), the short interest in SLV was much higher than nowadays (about 25-30%). Ted Buttler always defended that shorting the SLV was not permitted by the ETF prospectus itself, because shorting one share inhibits the adding os one Oz of silver (you can sell one share to a new investor without issuing it). He initiated a public campaign against BlackRock by permitting it. The result was a legal threat of BlackRock to Buttler, he had to retreat, but magically the short interest started to decrease during the next weeks/months till ""simbolic"" levels. Even during this last year, where we witnessing silver inflow to the trust of several hundreds os Moz over the year before, the short interest of SLV itself didn't rise.
SLV itself has no meaningful short interest itself, but the arbitrage among it and the spot/futures market make the concentrated shorts of the Comex very vulnerable. And remember, the master of the crooks, the one with the biggest and more corrupt influences, JPM, is no longer in the short side, so it will be no threated and by that will do nothing.

Advantages of SLV over PSLV are clear:

- Much more available on brokers (unless in Europe due to MiFid II)

- Much more liquid

- And of course, it has options!!

Tldr- Corner the market. GV thinks its possible to squeeze $SLV, FUCK AFTER SEEING $AG AND $GME EVEN I THINK WE CAN DO IT. BUY $SLV GO ALL IN TH GAINZ WILL BE UNLIMITED. DEMAND PHYSICAL IF YOU CAN. FUCK THE BANKS.

They are literally trying to create new social trends to divert funds away from GME.

I'm completely guessing here. But the lack of age in the NOK and AMC posts is a FACT. I just reported several as spam.

Disclosure: I am long GME. Fuck the funds. Not financial advice, this post is a statement of fact about the account age of recent NOK and AMC spam in this sub.

Edit: tons of comments here so if you're seeing this here is the advice I have. This is not financial advice, it's standard Reddit advice.

**When evaluating a post, go to that users profile page. Their actual profile page, click on their name you dolt don't just hover over it. Ok you made it. How many posts do they have, how many comments? How long have they been a redditor?**

**If less than a weej, it's a bot. If posting about the same single thing in a spammy parlance, it's a bot. 3-6 months? Maybe a bot. hard to say. 6+ months?

It's still under $15, less than half its ATH of $35.

GME hit $380 today, up *six times* its all time high of $63. That ridiculous price jump is going to scare away non-autist retail investors, and at that price, new buyers will be expending multiples more capital for the same upward pressure. I'm willing to bet that most of the diamond hang gang are in GME up to their tits and now going through their mothers' purse for more capital.

Also, #saveAMC is already trending, while people are *actively looking* for a new GME they feel they missed the boat on.

https://www.thestreet.com/investing/amc-shares-outerspace

Despite how low the price already was, it has a record number of shorts - over 38 million, meaning another short squeeze is on the menu.

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/

AMC has raised a billion dollars to weather out coronavirus, they have a ""Safe & Clean"" push, and they are going to be throwing out deals to everyone for them to come see the blockbusters that Hollywood has been sitting on after watching Tenet and WW1984 eat shit on streaming:

Coronavirus, the main cause for AMC's big downturn, is on the way out as vaccines will be available to all by spring, just ahead of summer blockbuster season.

Brick and mortar game stores *will* have less of a future, with or without coronavirus. There is no way to mount a 20 foot screen in your house. Unless, of course, you buy AMC stock now.

Here's the 200 shares I bought *yesterday* for the pittance of under a grand. I'm buying *a lot* more today.

Alright fellow Autists and Autits - here's the nitty gritty: **Wall Street is scared SHITLESS** today with all the retail buying in **NOK**. This may very well be GME 2.0 - *not* because of the short interest, but because of the blatant manipulation attempts by using Halts. Here is why they are scared...

**530 MILLION shares traded**

As of the time of this post, 530 MILLION shares have traded today compared to a meager 65 million shares traded daily on average. That's nearly 10x the usual daily volume!!! This volume shows our WSB army is strong and they are scrambling in fear!!!! (Hope they wore their brown pants)

**NOK making new highs at $8.81**

At the time of this post, NOK is currently trading at $6.67, down from the ATH of $8.81! It would be trading higher if it weren't for the volatility halts - MM's attempts at keeping price low. But we will not relent!!!

**Gamma Squeeze Incoming!**

\- Here's where things get extra extra spicy!!! Jan 29 Call Options only go up to a $8 strike. This morning, Open Interest was a staggering 150,345 contracts - of which 127,301 contracts are currently ITM!!!!

\- In ADDITION to the Open Interest, 278,065 moar contracts have traded today!!

\- As of right now, it is estimated that if price hits $7 by Friday, 408,777 contracts will be IN THE FUCKING MONEY which translates to an additional **40,877,000 SHARES that will need to be bought for option holders this FRIDAY**.

**tl;dr NOK looks very very ripe and tasty for a Gamma Squeeze this Friday which may drive shares up even further!**

**Obligatory:** I am but a fellow Autist and thus not an investment professional, and this is not to be considered investment advice.

**EDIT:** Shares needed to purchase by Friday corrected. I'm an obvious autist and shouldn't be trading but wtf do I know?!?!?"|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001802.csv|StockTicker|['NOK', 'RIDAY']|['NOK']|['S', 'DO', 'OUR', 'PART', 'PVOTE', 'FOR', 'OUR', 'ELLOW', 'TISTS', 'TO', 'GME', 'LLION', 'LLION', 'WSB', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'ATH', 'ITM', 'ITION', 'IN', 'THE', 'CKING', 'MONEY', 'HARES', 'NOK', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK']

I've been here since 2016 and I've seen some fucked up shit. I have even been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stonk Disorder (PTSD).

Some of you are up 200, 300, 400% on your GME positions right now, and still holding. I commend you for your diamond sacks, but lets not underestimate how evil, greedy, and cunning, big money can be.

Short interest is around 98% last I looked at the Ortex data a few hours ago.

#NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH OF THE CURRENT SHORT POSITIONS WERE OPENED AT THESE NEW LEVELS

At this point, all of the original shorts who were deeply underwater, have covered and gotten out. There is no doubt about that. Why does it matter?

These new shorts which were opened at current levels ARE NOT GOING TO MATTER AS MUCH UNLESS WE GET ANOTHER HUGE MOVEMENT UPWARD. And at this point, honestly ask yourself, what is the catalyst? Every retail investor has already heard about this and bought in, if they were going to. It's not like millions of normies are going to be pouring in to help push the price up to fuck the next level of shorts and cause another squeeze. 

I hate to break it to everyone, but the squeeze people were talking about 2 weeks ago ***HAS ALREADY HAPPENED***.

Is it possible another squeeze on these new short positions could happen? ***ABSOFUCKINGLUTELY***, However..

At this point, what is going to set this thing off? The Ryan Cohen news combined with a swarm of retards on here going all in is what triggered the first squeeze. Then we had news coverage, Elon and Chamath tweeting as the cherry on top. Is it possible that Ryan Cohen drops some big news within the next week or so to pop off short squeeze round 2? Sure. Is it possible some big whale comes along and decides to pump it and fuck the next round of shorts? Sure. But what im saying is, we already got a round of catalysts that were highly unlikely. It is not likely to get any better than we already got. 

#IF YOU ARE UP OVER 100% IT MAY BE TIME TO CALL IT. THERE IS A VERY GOOD CHANCE THAT WE WILL NOT GET ANOTHER BIG CATALYST TO SET OFF SHORT SQUEEZE ROUND TWO. Big money is doing shady shit, there is all sorts of manipulations going on, and just like we saw with the VW squeeze, this will come back down to earth, eventually. If you think GME is still going to be over 300 in a few weeks, you are fucking high. 

I don't know what else to say at this point. There's almost no DD going on here at this point. Every normie and their mother knows whats going on with GME. It's no longer a secret, you aren't getting in early at this point, and some of you are going to be surprised when it comes out that this big short squeeze you hoped for isnt coming because MM, big banks, and big money hedge funds LIED and did shady shit behind the scenes to prevent it.

I guarantee you Chamath closed out his small position already. Michael Burry also has and he even tweeted yesterday about how current levels are concerning. Last but not least, some of you seem to be under the impression that u/DeepFuckingValue is still holding because he thinks it's going to keep going up to 10k. ***He's holding still because it's been his baby for over a year now, he already pulled out a life changing amount of money so he probably doesn't care if it goes back down to 60, and lastly, he's holding as a fuck you to Melvin and company.*** This guy has balls of steel, I wouldn't be surprised if he held until expiration just to prove a point. I don't think this is about money to him anymore, and I don't think its wise or appropriate to interpret his refusal to sell as a sign of conviction in the current price levels, let alone a future price level of $1000.

Lastly, for those of you who have made 100+% returns in just a few days, do you really want to risk it? You realize this is a once in a lifetime event. You will never get this chance again, and if something happens and this thing comes back to earth, you will ***NEVER FORGIVE YOURSELF FOR NOT WALKING AWAY WHEN YOU WERE UP 300% on fucking SHARES ALONE***. ***YOU WILL HATE YOURSELF FOR BEING GREEDY, JUST LIKE MELVIN GOT GREEDY.***.

#SOME OF YOU HAVE WON THE GAME! YOU WON! NOW YOURE JUST TRYING TO RUB DIRT IN THE LOSING TEAMS FACE. EVEN IF THEY DESERVE IT, (WHICH THEY DO) WE NEED TO CONSIDER THAT THIS ISNT GOING TO LAST FOREVER, AND IT MIGHT BE TIME TO CALL IT IF YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO MAKE A 100, 200, 300% RETURN IN 2 FUCKING DAYS.

#No, I am not a bot you fucking idiot, look at my post history.

#Yes, I got out of my GME position earlier today. My total return on GME since last week is 460%. I am happy with that and I am not going to be DUPED into holding by bots and 500k new traders who have no experience and are just bandwagoning space ship emojis. I know better. When the normies flow in, I flow out. 

Good luck and god speed brothers."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001801.csv|StockTicker|['T', 'BE', 'TUPID', 'IT', 'MAY', 'BE', 'TIME', 'TO', 'CALL']|[]|['I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'OBODY', 'KNOWS', 'HOW', 'MUCH', 'OF', 'THE', 'RRENT', 'SHORT', 'TIONS', 'WERE', 'PENED', 'AT', 'THESE', 'NEW', 'EVELS', 'ARE', 'NOT', 'GOING', 'TO', 'ATTER', 'AS', 'MUCH', 'NLESS', 'WE', 'GET', 'OTHER', 'HUGE', 'EMENT', 'PWARD', 'I', 'HAS', 'READY', 'IF', 'YOU', 'ARE', 'UP', 'OVER', 'IT', 'MAY', 'BE', 'TIME', 'TO', 'CALL', 'IT', 'THERE', 'IS', 'A', 'VERY', 'GOOD', 'HANCE', 'THAT', 'WE', 'WILL', 'NOT', 'GET', 'OTHER', 'BIG', 'ALYST', 'TO', 'SET', 'OFF', 'SHORT', 'UEEZE', 'ROUND', 'TWO', 'VW', 'GME', 'I', 'DD', 'GME', 'MM', 'LIED', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'NEVER', 'RGIVE', 'RSELF', 'FOR', 'NOT', 'LKING', 'AWAY', 'WHEN', 'YOU', 'WERE', 'UP', 'HARES', 'YOU', 'WILL', 'HATE', 'RSELF', 'FOR', 'BEING', 'REEDY', 'JUST', 'LIKE', 'ELVIN', 'GOT', 'REEDY', 'SOME', 'OF', 'YOU', 'HAVE', 'WON', 'THE', 'GAME', 'YOU', 'WON', 'NOW', 'YOURE', 'JUST', 'RYING', 'TO', 'RUB', 'DIRT', 'IN', 'THE', 'OSING', 'TEAMS', 'FACE', 'EVEN', 'IF', 'THEY', 'SERVE', 'IT', 'WHICH', 'THEY', 'WE', 'NEED', 'TO', 'SIDER', 'THAT', 'THIS', 'ISNT', 'GOING', 'TO', 'LAST', 'REVER', 'AND', 'IT', 'MIGHT', 'BE', 'TIME', 'TO', 'CALL', 'IT', 'IF', 'YOU', 'HAVE', 'READY', 'BEEN', 'LUCKY', 'NOUGH', 'TO', 'MAKE', 'A', 'ETURN', 'IN', 'CKING', 'DAYS', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'DUPED', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'TWO', 'GME', 'DD', 'GME', 'AWAY', 'GME', 'GME']

Either way, GME is what started all of this and will be the biggest. I really don‚Äôt understand all this AMC and NOK nonsense . I‚Äôm long on both tickers, but they‚Äôre just not the perfect storm that is GME 

It‚Äôs a war, not a battle. You buy your shares in GME now. It sucks you missed the runup to $50, it sucks you missed the runup to $100, and it really sucks to miss the runup to $300. But you know what will feel good? When you unload your shares onto Melvin‚Äôs backside

GME 100 shares

There‚Äôs a few contenders here, the criteria for all of which is a high % short position.

The next short squeeze coming is AMC. AMC is only $.75c away from hitting a gamma squeeze level and we all know that this is what started the original rally in GameStop. It‚Äôs already up over 200% today, but don‚Äôt be fooled, if we see similar action, this stock can easily go above $50 and even beyond. üöÄüöÄüåôüåôüåô

2) Ongoing discussions over market regulations are happening behind closed doors between lawmakers, the SEC, and top brokerage firms/money managers

3) The current narrative is that GME is a story about ordinary Joe Retail taking on Wall Street greed and corruption- the Chamath interview solidified that. The public is on the side of Retail at this moment. Any attempts to introduce regulations to limit the activities of retail traders would receive significant public backlash.

4) An effort between top lawmakers and mainstream media is fomenting to change the narrative. 

5) Mainstream media outlets will begin solely blaming wsb for the GME debacle, they will begin to paint us as a ‚Äúfringe group‚Äù, they will dig up whatever posts they can to try and portray us as radical, alt-right, racist, etc. They will accuse us of coordinating an effort to deliberately destroy hedge funds, although they will not say the word hedge fund, they will say we have caused major losses in the pension and retirement portfolios of retirees, veterans, police and firefighters, teachers, etc Public perception will flip on wsb. 

6) regulations will be introduced. The general public will accept these regulations and blame wsb for them. 

7) Wall Street greed and corruption thrives while our meme stock gainz languish 

Please pass the message! If you have ever posted anything on WSb That can be used by the media to falsely paint us as a group of radicals or undesirables, delete it!

We all need to continue this fight. GME is a company that has a plan and a new face in Ryan Cohen. If GME can make it out of this, this share price is here to stay. Look at the valuations of other retail companies with significant e-commerce revenue, GME has significant room to go up from here! Hold strong.

AMC‚Äôs issues are 100% the result of COVID. They were at peak revenue in 2019. The vaccines are here, the movies are coming out, the people can‚Äôt wait to go outside and socialize again.

This company took a completely unwarranted nosedive from $6 to $3 in the 12 months prior to my purchase. Why? They halted their (very nice) dividend to conserve cash. This was not a bad thing but US boomer investors are pussies. Nokia wants to run the business like an actual business not like a ponzi scheme like Tesla. They accrued a lot of debt in the 2010s - they are Finnish, they hate debt. Why do they have debt? Massive investment in 5G infrastructure all over the world. Nokia is now positioned to be an absolute goldmine for the next generation of mobile networks. 

[https://investorplace.com/2019/11/nokia-stock-dividend-cut/](https://investorplace.com/2019/11/nokia-stock-dividend-cut/)

Since March, NOK has crept up nicely, touching $5 in Summer (no pump needed). It's currently < $7, which is basically FMV for this company going by traditional standards. Forget about the little run-up it had this week so far, that doesn't even scratch the surface of the potential here. 

So here is the deal: You want to go back in time and invest in GME at $5? Now is your chance. Nokia is at a new floor and the short squeeze has not even begun. There is no reason NOK can't get to $15+ on the basis of modern market fundamentals alone. Apply retard logic, and you can even see it hitting $100+ if the entire short bus that is WSB goes full-GME on it.

This is not an anti-GME post or some attempt to distract. Fucking diversify you idiots.

This can lead to a lot of innocent WSBers losing out on gains during the pandemic. We need this rise to be stable. If you want to buy either of these shares, DO NOT SELL THE OTHER ONE. Sell your Yugioh cards, your kids, your body...but DO NOT SELL EITHER GME OR BB.

Thanks. :)

EDIT: Just kidding, there was never a plan. WE JUST LIKE THE STOCK.

What a time to be alive. 

 *""Bulls make money, bears make money,* ***pigs get slaughtered****""* 

How ironic, that one of the most iconic sayings in investing, was coined by Wall Street itself. Right now, pigs are getting slaughtered, and crying for someone to blame.

**I want you guys to really think about this:**

Every investment you make, comes with inherit risks and rewards. These hedge funds, who shorted 130%+ of the GME float, took a MASSIVE FUCKING RISK. They beat this stock down to a pulp, and instead of taking out their profits (like bears), they got greedy (like fucking pigs) and continued to increase their short.

They are literally affecting peoples lives. Those who work at Gamestop. They wanted this to go completely bankrupt. Oh, and who's going to bail out the average joe? Who bails out Jim, who works behind the counter at Gamestop?

NO ONE.

But who bails out these hedge funds? Fucking think about it. Melvin Capital gets a 3bn bailout, because they took a HUGE FUCKING RISK, and got caught on the losing end. 

Also, lets talk about risk for a second.

These hedge fund and institutions took a big risk that didnt pan out. Okay, not a big deal. they can just take the L and move on. But no. They doubled down, and you get articles now BLAMING THE RETAIL INVESTOR FOR MANIPULATION. 

So let me ask you this:

1. they took a huge risk on a bet
2. they are losing the bet
3. instead of being on the receiving end of the loss, they blame others for the situation that they're in

If you take a huge risk, and you KNOW that there is a chance of a loss, and that loss occurs, the only reason why you would start blaming others and finding excuses, is because there is an inherit FLAW in the system.

Melvin and other shorts knew, that there was no way something like this could happen. Why? Because they have the instruments to manipulate you and your emotions, through BS articles, analysts, and mass media.

TLDR:

1. Shorts shorted 130%, took a huge risk and lost
2. instead of taking the L, they're blaming YOU for manipulating the market"|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001727.csv|StockTicker|['GME', 'GTFO']|['GME']|['I', 'GME', 'SSIVE', 'CKING', 'RISK', 'NO', 'ONE', 'HUGE', 'CKING', 'RISK', 'L', 'AMING', 'THE', 'ETAIL', 'ESTOR', 'FOR', 'ATION', 'KNOW', 'FLAW', 'BS', 'L', 'YOU']|['GME']

THESE ARE FUDDERS TRYING TO GET IN CHEAPER OR EXIT POSITIONS. THE HYPE IS REAL**

Nokia is now a market leader in networking and enterprise level technology, essentially providing infrastructure for all types of networks. They also manufacture telecommunications equipment and engage in licensing. The most exciting opportunity in their current business model is 5G, which could be the main catalyst for this seemingly boring stock to finally break through resistance and become a valuable asset in portfolios. I'll give some key updates and price targets below.¬†


Partnerships and beneficiary of 5G rollouts


For starters, it's been a common thesis that 5G will be the greatest investing opportunity of the decade, yet Nokia remains in a flat/downward pattern on the chart. They've recently earned several contracts that will give them a stronger moat in the 5G domain as well as steady revenues and growth opportunities. Recent contracts come from a very diverse group of partners, including:¬†

-A 5 year deal with T-Mobile, in which T-Mobile will power it's 2.5GHz mid-band spectrum using Nokia's AirScale Radio platform. In addition, Nokia will facilitate T-Mobile to upgrade it's mid-band LTE network to a 5G network.¬†

-Secured a government contract via the¬†National Cybersecurity Center for Excellence. Nokia was selected as the tech provider and collaborator for the 5G Cybersecurity Project. The federal agency plans to utilize Nokia's technology for the transition to 5G from 4G. The project intends to identify 5G use cases to highlight the efficacy of the components of 5G architecture against security threats as part of a government initiative to beef up it's cyber security and anti-spying tools.

-Partnership with Google Cloud¬†in which the 2 firms will work in unison on businesses' digital transformation at the network edge through both 5G connectivity and cloud-native applications and capabilities. The partnership's purpose is to develop solutions for communication service providers to modernize network infrastructure and ensure smooth transitions to cloud-native 5G-core. This will likely build an ecosystem of services that deployable anywhere, from network edge, to public clouds, private clouds, and carrier networks.¬†

-Nokia has also recently announced¬†partnerships with M1¬†for 5G solutions in Singarpore, as well as¬†TeleZ¬†to deploy key infrastructure solutions for TeleZ subsribers in Sweden, Lativa, Lithuania, and Estonia. They were also awarded a contract by NASA for $14.1 million to build 4G infrastructure on the moon.¬†


Nokia has more than 220 large enterprise customers across industries worldwide, of which at least 30 have deployed 5G. They were also in a geopolitical battle in which the U.S. expressed interest in owning a piece of the company, and in response Finland built it's stake in Nokia via Solidium Oy, the state's equity-asset manager, to 1 billion euros($1.2b usd). Nokia also intends to repurchase 500 million shares in the coming months, so demand for the stock is picking up on all levels.¬†


In addition to infrastructure, licensing is a huge part of Nokia's business model that will benefit from 5G. The ""Nokia Technologies"" Arm handles patent licensing, technology licensing, and brand licensing. This includes an industry-leading patent portfolio including ~20,000 patent families including ~3500 5G standard essential patent families.¬†


So why is a company with so many valuable assets and recently announced deals/partnerships still trading flat and so seemingly undervalued? The short answer is the former CEO made several bad choices which gave Nokia's competitors an upper hand on the current 5G landscape and put NOK share price in a long term downtrend which has gave it a reputation as a boring stock with an ugly chart. However, with new CEO Pekka Lundmark's expertise in driving returns to shareholders, as well as the scrutiny and subsequent bans of Huawei opening the door for competition, Nokia now has a much needed breath of life and a chance to gain market share to become the biggest beneficiary of the 5G revolution. The new CEO is determined to get Nokia to the top and pull in solid returns to shareholders, as evidenced by the slew of recent contracts/partnerships along with his plans for spending aggressively on R&D, as well as developing a leaner business model by cutting unnecessary expenses and unprofitable endeavors.¬†


Nokia is primed for growth as they plan into several emerging, high growth markets including 5G, IoT, Edge computing, Network Encryption, Cloud Radio Access, Software Defined Infrastructure(SDI), Cloud Managed LAN, Optical Communications and Networking, as well as established high growth markets such as Smart Wearables, Defense/Security, and LTE.¬†



Despite the slew of positive news surrounding Nokia and their partnerships/contracts, the stock is still very undervalued, even at today's price surge. 

That may soon change, as the stock's chart is beginning to signal incoming volatility. The implied volatility(IV) and volume for NOK call options are indicating big moves in the coming months. Open interest is on the rise as well.¬†




NOK is trading at a¬†Price/Book ratio¬†of¬†1.3x, compared to it's peers average of¬†4.0x¬†and the sector average¬†2.2x¬†

NOK is also undervalued in terms of¬†Price/LTM sales. It has a ratio of¬†0.9x, it's peers trade at an average of¬†3.9x, and the sector average of¬†1.8x

To establish the Fair Value Estimate, we'll use 2 models taking input from previous NOK financials, as well as data from competitors. (Competitors include: CSCO, ERIC, MSI, MSFT, and AAPL.

P/E Multiples:¬†$14.94¬†target¬†

Earnings Power Value:¬†$15.64¬†target¬†

The average for the 2 models imply a¬†Fair Value Estimate¬†of¬†$15.29 




These estimates are based on historical data, therefore are fair values for the current price and past performance, not taking into account the market share and recurring revenue recently secured. I believe over the 3 months ad beyond the fair value will be much higher as earnings begin to reflect the value and growth from 5G contracts and recurring revenues.¬†


Even currently, those estimates are a bit low as Nokia's closest competitor, Ericsson, has a market cap that is nearly 70% higher than Nokia, despite the two having very similar financials and even trailing Nokia in several key metrics.¬†



At NOK's current share price of, it remains undervalued as ERIC is only ahead of NOK in 2 key categories, EBITDA and Profit Margin, and ERIC is only outperforming NOK by a slim margin in these categories. I believe NOK should be valued much higher, than ERIC since they are gaining contracts MUCH faster than ERIC and also Huawei, which would imply a share price of¬†$7.11¬†before any buybacks place shares into the treasury, which would increase the price even further.¬†


Nokias Fair value is over $25

This is based on competitor ERIC who is valued 68.4% higher despite having trailing NOK in almost every key metric for valuation, and the valuation of Huawei who is losing tons of revenue and contracts in favor of Nokia"|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001759.csv|StockTicker|['$NOK', 'A']|['NOK']|['DO', 'NOT', 'ISTEN', 'TO', 'EOPLE', 'AYING', 'NOK', 'HYPE', 'ARE', 'BOTS', 'THESE', 'ARE', 'DDERS', 'RYING', 'TO', 'GET', 'IN', 'EAPER', 'OR', 'EXIT', 'TIONS', 'THE', 'HYPE', 'IS', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'A', 'LTE', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'Z', 'Z', 'NASA', 'G', 'G', 'U', 'S', 'G', 'G', 'CEO', 'G', 'NOK', 'CEO', 'G', 'CEO', 'D', 'G', 'T', 'LAN', 'LTE', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'LTM', 'NOK', 'CSCO', 'ERIC', 'MSI', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'E', 'I', 'G', 'ERIC', 'NOK', 'BITDA', 'ERIC', 'NOK', 'I', 'NOK', 'ERIC', 'MUCH', 'ERIC', 'ERIC', 'NOK']|['NOK', 'Z', 'Z', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'LTM', 'NOK', 'CSCO', 'ERIC', 'MSI', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'ERIC', 'NOK', 'ERIC', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'ERIC', 'ERIC', 'ERIC', 'NOK']

l6eqqu||People will try to gaslight you into believing that playing $GME is wrong or something to be ashamed of. But keep the following in mind...|t3_l6eqqu|0.99|23851|23851|top|2021-01-28 00:25:53.000000|o0DrWurm0o|984|Discussion|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6eqqu/people_will_try_to_gaslight_you_into_believing/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6eqqu/people_will_try_to_gaslight_you_into_believing/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6eqqu/people_will_try_to_gaslight_you_into_believing/|"Inevitably, there will be a smear campaign led by certain organizations and media members against retail traders who are getting in on $GME. One argument that will be made is that it's not fair that we made so much money by recognizing that a group of hedge funds and institutions were in over their heads. It hurts the market and we should feel bad for exploiting them.

The total market cap of $GME is around $12B as I'm writing this. **The total market cap of Wall Street is around $50T.** That means we've currently displaced about .025% of the total value of the US stock market. I will type that out to reiterate: we (retail traders) have displaced approximately one quarter of one tenth of one percent of the total market cap. To claim that we are doing anything which is tremendously harmful to the whole market is absolutely pants-on-fire lies. Is this going to change some elements of the market moving into the future? Almost certainly. But even if this stock goes to $1000 per share, we are still only talking about less than one tenth of one percent of the total market cap that's out there. 

If you're looking at your RH balance right now  and thinking ""wow, that's a lot of money, am I doing something wrong? Illegal, even?"" the answer is **ABSOLUTELY NOT.** What you are beginning to notice is that the wealth gap in this country is absolutely massive. Thousands upon thousands of people could make year changing or life changing money out of this squeeze and it'll hardly be a blip on Wall Street's radar. Greed is absolutely out of control at the top and this funny little news story is tangible proof of that. Do not let them gaslight you into thinking that it's wrong for you to get a slightly larger sliver of the pie. 

Good luck to everyone playing this. I've got 100 shares at a cost basis of $103.95. I might not make millions, but I might be able to make a dent in my student loans, or pay off my car, or something that makes me just a little more hopeful that I'll be able to live some sort of ""American Dream"" before I'm old and wrinkled.

edit: and in the event that you're literally brand new to trading (we're getting a lot of new people here), I would highly encourage you to read up on investment basics (there are literally millions of resources on this) and do some research into $GME and why it's moving the way it is. I would not recommend taking a position on any stock if you can't articulate your own reason as to why you're invested in it."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001706.csv|StockTicker|['$GME']|['GME']|['$GME', '$GME', 'B', 'T', 'US', 'I', 'RH', 'I', 'UTELY', 'NOT', 'I', 'I', 'I', '$GME', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Before you autists get all frothy at me, I'm not telling anyone to give up their üíéüôå. The beauty of stocks is that you can own more than one.

AMC opened today at 4x the price, after trending up for days. It bounced around half its ATH of $35, before closing at 300% gain for the day.

GME hit $380 today, up six times its all time high of $63. The current GME price scares away non-autist retail investors, and at that price, new buyers will be expending multiples more capital for the same upward pressure.

If you don't believe me, look at the numbers. As GME is hitting mainstream and is the big hotness on this sub, AMC also outperformed GME by 165% by close today.

Also, #saveAMC is already trending as it gains traction across social media. People are actively looking for a new GME they feel they missed the boat on.

Despite how low the price already was, it has a record number of shorts: over 38 million. This means another short squeeze isn't just on the menu - it's already starting. It's the third most shorted stock out there, despite its clearly viable future. This doesn't distract from GME's slaughter of hedge funds because it's the next wave of their an hero.

AMC has raised a billion dollars to weather out coronavirus, amid an ongoing ""Safe & Clean"" push. Some studios like WB are moving to parallel releases on HBO Max, but AMC is already throwing out deals to get people in the door. Meanwhile, Hollywood has been sitting on blockbusters after watching Tenet and WW1984 eat shit on streaming:

https://screenrant.com/tenet-box-office-failure-warner-bros-2021-movies-impact/

Their debt/equity ratio has also been trending positively, even as coronavirus has intensified. Just a return to the mean suggests ridiculous gain, even ignoring the likelihood of pent-up demand. AMC has legs not just for the next week, but for the next few quarters.

Coronavirus, the main cause for AMC's big downturn, is on the way out as vaccines will be available to all by spring, just ahead of summer blockbuster season.

In the long term, after hedge fund shorters lose their ass on GME, brick and mortar game stores will have less of a future, with or without coronavirus. It's easier to digitally download games, and hardware can be bought online and received the next day from any number of retailers. There's no way to mount a 20 foot screen in your house. Unless, of course, you buy AMC stock now.

We've got so many comments and submissions that we can't possibly even read them all, let alone act on them as moderators. We wrote software to do most of the moderation for us but that software isn't allowed to read the Reddit new feed fast enough and submit responses, and the admins haven't given us special access despite asking for it.

We're suffering from success and our Discord was the first casualty. You know as well as I do that if you gather 250k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad. That room was golden and the people that run it are awesome. We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you don't get to hang out with your friends anymore. Discord did us dirty and **I am not impressed with them destroying our community** instead of stepping in with the wrench we may have needed to fix things, especially after we got over 1,000 server boosts. That is pretty unethical.

To add to this, people are co-opting our name on twitter. I won't mention their accounts, but lots of handles with ""wsb"" and ""wallstreetbets"" in them are pretending to speak for us. They're saying things that we don't agree with, driving traffic to derivative communities and shitty pixelated merch stores, and generally making it harder for us to define who we are. There's also too much political bullshit in a community that was never *ever* political. The only way I want to occupy Wall St is in a suit myself or rent-free in the mind of a blown up short.

That is why I'm throwing my support behind the Twitter handle in general. We need a way to PUBLICLY reach out to the staff of the infrastructure that is failing us so the world can see that we aren't doing anything wrong here if they don't respond. We need to be able to respond directly to a reporter that is lying to the world about our clubhouse. We can't be expected to meet any expectations when we aren't given the tools we need.

That's not to say I approve of every message or will even be in the loop for all of them, but it's clear to me we can't do nothing and we need a megaphone.

**http://twitter.com/wsbmod** aka **@wsbmod** is the only Twitter handle whose statements are directly from some part of the team.

We'll do our best not to pretend to speak for you, but to try to speak with the volume our name now seems to command to get shit done for us."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001706.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'LICLY', 'I']|[]

If not change it.

I wrote this in response to someone elsewhere who asked simply:

> So they're betting against the company? Like, they have no faith in them? Investing like this makes one feel horrible.

Yeah. There are three ways you can short.

--- 

1) You buy an option with a predetermined end date with the RIGHT to sell a stock at a certain price (depending on how much you want to pay determines the price.) If a stock is $10 and you expect it to drop to $5 in 6 months, you might buy a $9, 10 month expiry ""put"" (right to sell at price) option. This might cost you 50c per share. 

IF you're even slightly right, ie it drops to any price lower than $8.49 before expiry you made 1c per share. You can also change your mind and sell the option (either more (profit) or less (loss) than 50c/share).

IF you're properly right, and it does drop to exactly $5 you make $3.5 per share. If it rises, or drops to any number above $8.50, you lose the price of the option (50c/share). 

---

2) You're a big player. You call your buddies at Pension Fund X42 and say ""Hey can I borrow those shares you have for x% interest and return them to you later?"" A set timeframe may be set. I don't know for sure, but probably. Anyhow, Pension Fund X42 says ""ok"" because they aren't looking to sell them, so might as well make some interest on lending them. 

So you borrow them, and immediately sell them. You pay your daily interest to the pension fund, and you wait. When the price drops, and you decide that you've made enough, you buy them back and return them. You keep the difference in prices whatever that may be, minus the interest.

If you're wrong... You're still obliged to return the shares to Pension Fund X42. So at some point you have to decide to eat a loss and buy the shares back. 

---

3) You're a big player and you are ok with a bit of lawbreaking, you Naked Short Sell. This is great because it's cheaper! No interest payments! 

Here, you simply sell shares you don't have, and buy the imaginary shares you just created back later so that the number of shares on issue doesn't get too far out of whack and you don't get investigated. Any gap between your sell price and buy price is profit or loss depending on which way it goes. 

---

What's happened right now is mostly a combination of 2 and 3. I'm sure there is a bit of 1, but 1 only causes predictable losses (Like the cost of playing a hand at a casino. You only lose the amount you bet if the cards don't go your way.)

So the risk with 2 and 3 is that because you're **obliged** to buy back the shares at some point, if they go up, when you have to quit, you have to pay the current market price and your actions can make the price go up even more. 

Now you're in a short squeeze. You are obliged to buy but the price keeps going up every time you do. It's entirely possible that others see the price going up and buy, so you're now competing to buy a limited number of shares with everyone else. So the price goes higher. Your losses are potentially infinite. 

---

**What's slightly different** between this particular short squeeze and all the others is:

---

1) The dumb fucks naked short sold AT LEAST 40% more shares than ever existed. They're obliged to buy back more shares than is possible. The only way out of that self-made trap is a complicated mess of desperately buying, returning, rebuying from the people you borrowed them from, and returning them with losses at every step. Imagine if I sold you 10 cars, but only delivered 6. You're standing there with your wtf face and I say ""Hey! how much would you sell those 4 cars for?"" You can name your price at this point. I pay it. Then I ""finish"" my ""10 car delivery.""

---

2) Retail traders are acting as one single semi-coordinated hive, loosely behaving similarly to what would in prior short squeezes, be a competitor hedge fund. They own a lot of the shares the hedge funds (HFs) NEED to buy - but they're not selling. They're actively cheering for the HFs bankruptcy while watching the price of the stock they hold skyrocket. Only other HF billionaires are allowed to do that and get away with it. 

.

2a) HFs can be negotiated with. If you're really, really getting bent over and fucked, and you grovel enough, you can usually cut a deal where they stop trying to fuck you. If they won't talk to you, they'll often talk to your bank/broker/some other bigger player that can convince them that your bankruptcy will also cause significant losses or bankruptcy of another party they're not trying to fuck and they might like to have as friends one day. ""You quit this, and we'll owe you one."" It's always good to have favours to call.

.

2b) The self proclaimed retards on WSB can't be negotiated with. They don't need favours. They don't care if you go bankrupt or there's collateral damage. They don't give a fuck about any of them. For the most part they only hold a few hundred shares each max - and also for the most part, they're playing with their own money that they can actually afford to lose even if it hurts for a year or two. 

How do you negotiate with, or swat a million wasps stinging you? You can't.

**Edit.**

Thanks for all the awards guys! I'll soon have enough to make a Tiara and become your –Øetard Prince for the day! I was actually expecting posts telling my how wrong I am. I only think I know what the fuck is going on most of the time and usually figure out later that it wasn't.

I'd like to thank the academy, and my parents who never believed in me, and Scruffy, my first dog, who, like WSB, played chicken with truck, and, and, and...

Also. 

I figure since this is so popular, I might as well nominate my suggestion for the inevitable u/deepfuckingvalue movie. It's fairly likely to be seen as a sequel to the Wolf of Wall St, so.... ""The Fox/Foxes of Main Street"" ? Yeah, nah?

Should the SEC illegally or unjustly intervene on behalf of their friends (who so often reward government poodle regulators with lucrative jobs after leaving civil service), we will need to find a large law firm that specializes in securities and class actions and is willing to setup a trust account where you give your name, nominal retainer fee, and proof that you owned $GME to establish standing in a suit.

After we're done mailing boxes labeled ""extra Jimmy shares"" full of peanut brittle snakes to Melvin's Syndicate of Stupidity HQ, I propose we buy out the contract of the wax-headed Seinfeld character on CNBC.

From then on, we make him the WSB mascot. Dress him as a clown and rent him out for children's burthday parties. Make him wear a sandwich board reading ""beanie babies are crash-proof"" and have him stand outside the NYSE every day until he straight up expires from old age. Legally change his name to Jimmy ToMoon? By all means.


Me? I just wanna dress him in little sweaters and take him on walks.

First a bit about me, I'm young and have been trading successfully with my own money for the last 2.5 years and am now retired. Thanks Elon.

With that out of the way, the beautiful thing about this movement is it's not a movement with any one representative point of view. It's more of a public gathering where if one person has an idea and it's well thought through, it gets upvoted and awarded. It's truly democratic and decentralized.

The GME phenomenon started exactly this way, when a few people including Michael Burry (Big Short fame) noticed that it was trading ridiculously below book value. Others on here took notice and believe it or not, did thorough due diligence (I encourage you to use the ""DD filter"" and see some of this, it's pretty incredible work) with financials laid out and then wrote posts about it. When Chewy founder Ryan Cohen took on a large position and became another activist investor with a grand new vision, more people on here noticed and saw not only and undervalued asset but one with actual explosive growth potential given the gaming sector growth.

Then people here took notice of the fact that 148% of the float was sold short (still a bit hazy on how this is legal) and did what Wall St. and the mainstream media didn't do, they looked and saw the audacity and greed of a few funds who thought they could never lose, were completely over leveraged and then acted on this public info and posted about it. More people here noticed and more people acted.

This is done everyday by hedge funds behind closed doors. The only thing we did differently is we did it out in the open and without inside information.

With that said, I have to respectfully decline to go on the air and be a representative of over 2.8 million members of Wallstreetbets, which by design, is not a coordinated movement and should not have a representative. I sincerely believe this and am not trying to be a hero or ""anti-establishment.""

I really appreciate you reaching out and I want you to feel free to use any of this for your segment but please make sure to stress that this is just the view of 1 out of 2.8 million people and not necessarily the views of the subreddit. I really think Fox Business has a once in a lifetime opportunity to cover the shift of market power from private to public and to differentiate itself from the hacks at CNBC.

Godspeed and make us proud!

[I blew my account up last week on FD's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2b0no/how_i_blew_up_my_account_today_and_lost_90000/) from 100k to 20k. GME finally brought me back to 100k today after holding for about a week, and I paper hands'ded and sold. I was just ecstatic to 'undo' the fuck-up that blew my account up. I am terrified of losing that money again, it's everything I've saved up since 2017.

I am glad the mods made this sub private earlier. ***I am seeing the true level of conviction of the REAL WSB OG's***. I am seeing that there was a lot of noise today, and that the people who have been here the longest, who have bled and fought with me through JNUG/JDST, through meme-ing AMD at $13, through TSLA squeeze, through a GLOBAL FUCKING PANDEMIC.. are still diamond handing this.

#I feel like I betrayed you guys today.

I seriously told myself after selling today that I was going to stay 100% cash until this all blew over. It's been hard to know what is really going on lately because of all the bots and astroturfing. But I have seen the level of conviction of the TRUE VETERAN AUTISTS of this sub and I am rejuvenated.

Although I can't afford to risk all of my money, ***I am not going to sit on the sidelines after the laughs, the panic, the joy, the loss, and the good times this sub has given me over the years.*** I honestly see you guys as friends, even if I don't see your faces, or know you on a personal level. And friends stick it out, through whatever bullshit life throws at them.

#TOMORROW I AM BACK IN. 5K WORTH OF SHARES, AND HOLDING UNTIL THE END. NO STOP LOSS, NO LIMIT SELL. FOR GLORY, OR FOR DEATH. I WILL STAND BY YOU BROTHERS.

#***the horn of hammerhand will sound in the deep one last time.***

Bit of background: I've been on this sub for years (was even a mod temporarily when /u/only1parkjisung modded a bunch of people for fun long, long ago), and I've been in the hedge fund world for about a decade (I'm a sell-side analyst; won't go into more detail than that as it isn't necessary). I mention all of this because I know both how this world works and how the hedge fund world works, which gives me a unique insight into what might happen next.

I won't make any predictions on GME, BB, or other stocks, because I don't think the squeeze's biggest risk right now is there. Rather, the biggest risk comes from what we've already seen happen over at Discord with the shutdown of the server. Note that Discord has had significant investment from private equity funds including FirstMark Capital, Greenoaks Capital Partners, Index Ventures, IVP, Greylock Partners, Benchmark, Accel, General Catalyst, Ridge Ventures, Spark Capital, and Tencent Holdings. At least one of these firms has invested with Point72 Ventures, which recently helped Melvin Capital. So it's not too surprising that strings were pulled to get the Discord channel banned for ""hate speech"" (which is a very useful brush to tar anyone with, as anyone who challenges it can easily be dismissed as a nazi).

Now, this subreddit's long history of using several slurs is an opportunity for the hedge fund world to claim it is a hate subreddit and pressure Reddit to get it closed. I recommend the r-word and f-word be banned by mods for this reason; yes I know it is stupid and, well, r-worded, but best to play the game and self censor rather than give these assholes a single in to destroy this community.

What is the risk of Reddit getting orders from owners to shut us down? At the moment, I'd say pretty low, but the bigger it gets the more there is that risk. Reddit is owned by Advance Publications, which is owned by Donald Newhouse and the Newhouse family (some details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Newhouse). Fortunately, Newhouse's family office (think a private hedge fund dedicated to investing just the family's money) is pretty far removed from the hedge fund world afaik. The family office's CIO (details here: https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1g6j2tztzpb3t/A-New-CIO-for-One-of-America-s-Richest-Families) got her career started in the investment bank world and did not work for hedge funds, at least according to her Linkedin profile. So the Donaldson family has limited motive to stick their necks out and force a ban of this subreddit.

However, it remains a risk and a very serious one. I suggest the mods work together to get some legal representation going; if Palihapitiya was serious about investing in the WSB community, I'd suggest putting some money aside for this and for compliance. A kickstarter fund would not be a good idea because of the ease with which bad faith arguments of collusion could be made.

In short, WSB is at the mercy of Reddit's admins, who are at the mercy of its executives, who are at the mercy of the owners. While WSB is making serious progress as a revolution against the billionaires, this is a very serious weakness that the Discord ban has exposed and that mods need to work on fixing asap."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001720.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'BB', 'I', 'IVP', 'I', 'I', 'CIO', 'I', 'WSB', 'A', 'WSB', 'WSB']|['GME', 'CIO']

Here's a couple key takeaways:

* Theoretically, the maximum amount of a company's float that could be shorted is equal to the float itself; although, in reality, it's rare for a stock to have a short interest greater than 50%.
* Short selling is an [advanced trading strategy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trading-strategy.asp) used by investors to speculate on an expected price decline of a stock or other [security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp).

Stop acting like you need to hold our hands and protect us.  That's bullshit.  None of you actually care, you're just upset that retail is absolutely killing it while your shitty portfolio is selling off.

What exactly are we risking anyways?  Most people on WSB are young with maybe a few $10K's in the bank.  We are the exact people who should be taking risks.  $10K invested in the stock market even over the next 30 years isn't gonna change your life.

This is a moment in history where billions of dollars have flowed from the rich to the poor.  Where it'll end up, who knows, but I guarantee that we'd rather play the game and take the loss if it happens than sit on the sidelines and play it safe.  The truth is that if you want to make it in this world, you have to take big ass risks.  The downside is usually overstated.

Here is the longer DD for the short squeeze case for SLV, a follow-up from my shorter post a few hours ago. Note that I talk in first person as this is something I‚Äôm going to do. Everyone is free to do as they individually please and copy my trade if they‚Äôd like to.  I think it‚Äôs absurd that forces at be think this forum is manipulating by posting publicly but that‚Äôs where we are at right now. 

First things first, **I'm not doing this until the GME rise is done.** I am long GME but am going long SLV immediately after. 

Update 1/29: due to the manipulation and collusion of citadel, hedge funds, and brokers to change the rules and rig the game in their favor. Who likely knew ahead of time and bought puts right before and calls at the bottom, GME is too important to abandon still. SLV is still my next plat but GME needs to go to $1000 and these people need to go to jail. 

**If you just want to know what to buy skip to the end**

I present 2 investment DDs in this post, the short squeeze and the fundamentals.  If you want to see what to buy

**The short squeeze:**

Buy SLV shares and SLV call options to force physical delivery of silver to the SLV vaults. Also buy physical silver bullion.  The best possible thing would be to take physical delivery in the futures market if you have access to do so.

The silver futures market has oscillated between having roughly 100-1 and 500-1 ratio of paper traded silver to physical silver, but lets call it 250-1 for now.  This means that for every  250 ounces in open interest in the futures market, only 1 actually gets delivered.  Most traders would rather settle with cash rather than take delivery of thousands of ounces of silver and have to figure out to store and transport it in the future.

The people naked shorting silver via the futures markets are a couple of large banks and making them pay dearly for their over leveraged naked shorts would be incredible.  It's not Melvin capital on the other side of this trade, its JP Morgan.  Time to get some payback for the bailouts and manipulation they've done for decades (look up silver manipulation fines that JPM has paid over the years).

The way the squeeze could occur is by forcing a much higher percentage of the futures contracts to actually deliver physical silver.  There is very little silver in the COMEX vaults or available to actually be use to deliver, and if they have to start buying en masse on the open market they will drive the price massively higher.  There is no way to magically create more physical silver in the world that is ready to be delivered.  With a stock you can eventually just issue more shares if the price rises too much, but this simply isn't the case here.  The futures market is kind of the wild west of the financial world.  Real commodities are being traded, and if you are short, you literally have to deliver thousands of ounces of silver per contract if the holder on the other side demands it.  If you remember oil going negative back in May, that was possible because futures are allowed to trade to their true value.  They aren't halted and that's what will make this so fun when the true squeeze happens.

Edit for more detail:  let‚Äôs say there‚Äôs one futures seller who gets unlucky and gets the buyer who actually wants to take delivery. He doesn‚Äôt have the silver and realizes it‚Äôs all of a sudden damn difficult to find some physical silver.  He throws up his hands and just goes long a matching number of futures contracts and will demand actual delivery on those. Problem solved because he has now matched the demanding buyer with a new seller.  The issue is that the new seller has the same issue and does the exact same thing.  This is how the cascade effect of a meltup occurs.  All the naked shorts trying to offload their position to someone who actually has some silver. My goal is to ensure that I have the silver and won‚Äôt sell to them until silver is at a far higher price due to the desperation. 

The silver market is much larger than GME in terms of notional value, but there is very little physical silver actually readily available (think about the difference between total shares and the shares in the active float for a stock), and the paper silver trading hands in the futures market is hundreds of times larger than what is available.  Thus when they are forced to actually deliver physical silver it will create a massive short squeeze where an absurd amount of silver will be sought after (to fulfill their contractually obligated delivery) with very little available to actually buy.  They are naked shorting silver and will have to cover all at once and the float as a percentage of the total silver stock globally is truly miniscule.

**The fundamentals:**

The current gold to silver ratio is 73-1.  Meaning the price of gold per ounce is 73 times the price of silver.  Naturally occurring silver is only 18.75 times as common as gold, so this ratio of 73-1 is quite high.  Until the early 20th century, silver prices were pegged at a 15-1 ratio to gold in the US because this ratio was relatively known even then.  In terms of current production, the ratio is even lower at 8-1.  Meaning the world is only producing 8 ounces of silver for each newly produced ounce of gold.

Global industry has been able to get away with producing so little new silver for so long because governments have dumped silver on the market for 80 years, but now their silver vaults are empty.  At the end of WW2 government vaults globally contained 10 billion ounces of silver, but as we moved to fiat currency and away from precious metal backed currencies, the amount held by governments has decreased to only 0.24 billion ounces as they dumped their supply into the market. But this dumping is done now as their remaining supply is basically nil.

This 0.24 billion ounces represents only  8% of the total supply of only 3 billion ounces stored as investment globally.  This means that 92% of that gold is held privately by institutions and by millions of boomer gold and silver bugs who have been sitting on meager gains for decades.  These boomers aren't going to sell no matter what because they see their silver cache as part of their doomsday prepper supplies.  It's locked away in bunkers they built 500 miles from their house. Also, with silver at $23 an ounce currently, this means all of the worlds investment grade silver only has a total market cap of $70 billion.  For comparison the investment grade gold in the world is worth roughly $6 trillion. This is because most of the silver produced each year actually gets used, as I have mentioned.  $70 billion sounds like a lot, but we don‚Äôt have to buy all that much for the price to go up a lot.  

**If the squeeze happens, it would be like 40 years worth of their gains in 4 months **

The reason that only 8 ounces of silver are produced for every 1 ounce of gold in today's world is because there aren't really any good naturally occurring silver deposits left in the world.  Silver is more common than gold in the earth's crust, but it is spread very thin.  Thus nearly every ounce of silver produces is actually a byproduct of mining for other metals such as gold or copper.  This means that even as the silver price skyrockets, it wont be easy to increase the supply of silver being produced.  Even if new mines were to be constructed, it could take years to come online.

Finally, most of this newly created silver supply each year is used for productive purposes rather than kept for investment.  It is used in electronics, solar panels, and jewelry for the most part. This demand wont go away if the silver price rises, so the short sellers will be trying to get their hands on a very small slice of newly minted silver.  The solar market is also growing quickly and political pressure to increase solar and electric vehicles could provide more industrial demand.

The other part of the story is the faster moving piece and that is the inflation and currency debasement fear portion.  The government and the fed are printing money like crazy debasing the value of the dollar, so investors look for real assets like precious metals to hide out in, driving demand for silver.  The $1.9 trillion stimulus passing in a month or two could be a good catalyst.  All this money combined with the reopening of the economy could cause some solid inflation to occur, and once inflation starts it often feeds on itself.

I will be putting **50% directly into SLV shares, and 50% into the $35 strike SLV calls expiring 4/16**.  This way the SLV purchase creates a groundswell into silver immediately that then rockets through a gamma squeeze as SLV approaches $35.  Price target of $75 for SLV by end of April if the short squeeze happens.

Edit: for the part of your purchases going into shares, some people recommend PSLV because they think SLV might start lying about having the silver in their vault. Or that the custodian will be double counting, ie claiming that the same silver belongs to multiple people (banking on the fact that people wont all try to get their silver at once).  So if you buy SLV shares and calls, that's great.  But I think it could be prudent for us to buy options in SLV (no options on PSLV) and shares in PSLV.  It all depends on how paranoid you want to be.  There is a lot of paranoia in the precious metals world. 

Alternate options:

\- buying physical silver; this also works but you pay a premium to buy and sell so its less efficient and you take fewer silver ounces off of the market because of the premium you pay

\- going long futures for February or March; if you are a rich bastard and can actually take physical delivery of 1000s of ounces of silver by all means do so.  But if you simply settle for cash you are actually part of the problem.  We need actual physical delivery, which is what SLV demands and is why SLV is the way to go unless you are going to take delivery

\- miners; I don‚Äôt recommend buying miners as part of this trade.  Miners will absolutely go up if SLV goes up, but buying them doesn't create the squeeze in the actual silver market.  Furthermore, most silver miners only derive 30-50% of their revenue from silver anyways, so eventually SLV will outperform them as it gets high enough (and each marginal SLV dollar only increases miner profits by a smaller and smaller percentage)

**Details on SLV physical settlement:**

When SLV issues shares, the custodian is forced to true up their vaults with the proportional amount of silver daily.  From the SLV prospectus:

""An investment in Shares is:  Backed by silver held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust.  The Shares are backed by the assets of the Trust. The Trustee‚Äôs arrangements with the Custodian contemplate that at the end of each business day there can be in the Trust account maintained by the Custodian no more than 1,100 ounces of silver in an unallocated form. The bulk of the Trust‚Äôs silver holdings is represented by physical silver, identified on the Custodian‚Äôs or, if applicable, sub-custodian's, books in allocated and unallocated accounts on behalf of the Trust and is held by the Custodian in London, New York and other locations that may be authorized in the future.""

Join me brothers.  Lets take silver to the moon and take on the biggest and baddest manipulators in the world.  Please post rocket emojis in the comments as desired.

Disclaimer: do your own research, make your own decisions, everything here is a guess and hypothetical and nothing is guaranteed, not a financial advisor, I have ADHD and maybe other things too. 

Bear case:  silver does tend to sell off if the broader market plunges so it‚Äôs not immune to broad market sell off.  It‚Äôs also the most manipulated market in the world so we are facing some tough competition on the short side"|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001730.csv|StockTicker|['DD', 'SLV']|['DD']|['DD', 'SLV', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'SLV', 'GME', 'SLV', 'GME', 'I', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'JP', 'JPM', 'COMEX', 'I', 'GME', 'US', 'I', 'I', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'PSLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'I', 'SLV', 'PSLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'I', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'I', 'ADHD']|['DD', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'JPM', 'GME', 'ADHD']

First, let‚Äôs talk about fish. What do they do before they die? They jump around; they try to escape; they make noises. If your hands are weak, you let the fish escape. Now you cannot feed your family because your hands are just made of paper.

I know you are scared, me too. Especially when we thought we lost our guidance today after trading hours and we saw the price dropped without an ability to do anything. For me, I‚Äôve just bought some more at $350 for 16k and I was scared shitless. I‚Äôm not gonna lie.

But, you should know that THEY ARE SCARED too, even more than us. You see, Melvin is nothing but just a big fish to us. This fucking shark I gotta bring it down not only to feed my family but also yours. But before we defeat them, they will use every dirty trick to fuck us over to win back this game. You will get hurt if your hands are not made of diamond. So HOLD IT tight, like you hold your wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs dong.

# WHEN TO SELL?

When you see the price goes up 5 times, 10 times, 50 times, or even more from one day to a week. That is when the short-queeze happens. That is when you sell. If your hands are made of paper, sell your position when it‚Äôs 5x. If your hands are made of wood, sell it at 10x. And so on so forth.

DO NOT SELL IT WHEN THE SQUEEZE DOESN‚ÄôT HAPPEN YET. I repeat, **DO NOT SELL IT WHEN THE SQUEEZE DOESN‚ÄôT HAPPEN YET**. This is a phenomenon that happens only ONCE in your life. You don‚Äôt want to miss it.

TL;DR: Only sell when you see the price spikes up 5x, 10x, 100x from one day to a week. This is the way.

I speak for myself here and no one else (and no one else here speaks for everyone else either).  Feel free to DM for more facts and context.

CNBC, whether its true or not, the past 3 days have made EVERYONE honestly believe that you are truly bought out by Wall Street, in every sense. You‚Äôve paraded ‚Äúanalyst‚Äù after analyst, hedge fund manager after manager, boomer after boomer, to try and demonize and deflect blame for the GameStop situation.

**Firstly, your contributors need to stop pretending they don‚Äôt know short squeeze mechanics.**

You‚Äôve had dozens of people on your air whining about how no one in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) cares about fUnDaMeNtALs and VaLuATiOn regarding GameStop. OF COURSE, we don‚Äôt care about GME‚Äôs fundamentals *anymore*, because we are in a SQUEEZE. We are in a squeeze in which the Shorts have DOUBLED-DOWN constantly. That means OF COURSE the price keeps going into the stratosphere. Do you actually believe your own lie that the Shorts like Melvin have closed out? I don‚Äôt, and we have data that agrees. Why would we sell our shares ‚Äú‚Äôfair value‚Äù‚Äù if the squeeze isn‚Äôt done?

Secondly, most of us are well aware that GME isn‚Äôt a $100billion company, or whatever $5000/share is. I think we are all very much aware that we are in the middle of a short squeeze, NOT price discovery.

*This does not mean that our interest in GME was not a* ***value-based thesis*** *at first*.

Our most famous GME long u/ DeepF\*\*kingValue has been in GME since 2019.([!!!](https://t.co/TengJuA7O9?amp=1)). There are others here who I‚Äôm sure joined at some point way back when. If you want more credibility, the famous Michael Burry and some dudebro Donald Foss both entered large positions in GME a long time ago. These people believed in the **FUTURE** ***VALUE*** of GME. They saw that savage, unrelenting short sellers like Melvin had *pounded* the share price into the ground, actively and immorally aiming for bankruptcy. Retail bought in in September because Ryan Cohen saw enough **value** to buy stock. The price jumped to $13/share in November because Ryan Cohen expressed his vision for a turnaround that people saw a ton of future **value** in. The big spike happened when Cohen n co. joined the BOARD OF DIRECTORS at GME. Why are your hosts and ‚Äúanalysts‚Äù pretending that these things didn‚Äôt happen?

And the whole while, Melvin and Shorts were DOUBLING DOWN on their positions, which were already part of the preposterous, irresponsible and potentially illegal +100% short interest. And even now (as far as we know), the short interest IS STILL **OVER 100%**. STOP PRETENDING THAT THESE THINGS DID NOT HAPPEN. You‚Äôve had people constantly claiming that the prices are reaching these levels ‚Äúfor no reason‚Äù and that the initial bullish sentiment was created ‚Äúout of thin air‚Äù. The people who keep saying these things, including your hosts, are either willfully ignorant or acting in bad faith.

Good, decent people provided their Due Diligence on this subreddit. They pointed out the $6.4billion in revenue in 2019. They pointed out the E-commerce sales *tripling* YOY. They pointed out the ability to easily pay off debt. They even called HUNDREDS of GameStops, where we found out they were constantly selling out of inventory, AND have plans of having PC-building-stations in-store. They pointed out the rapidly expanding Gaming Market, and the ability to grab substantial market share. And yes, they pointed out the 140% short interest, **BUT PEOPLE DID NOT START BUYING $GME SOLELY BECAUSE OF SHORT INTEREST**. Smart or not, honest people here bought into GME initially as a **value** play. They did their homework. They found data. They showed proof of positions. This brings me to my third point:

In the entire time I have been on wallstreetbets, we have NEVER ‚Äútargeted‚Äù a stock or hedge fund JUST to bust the shorts. Short-busting is not who WSB is. Those are the kids on TikTok, or the grifters on Twitter. Every single *popular* thesis on here has been backed up with [research](https://t.co/1ab5ppItOo?amp=1), [financial analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqk15o/fallen_angels_shitty_cars_worse_debt_and_what_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and quality (depending on who you ask) discussion. Just because we talk like, stupid people, doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt say smart things. And maybe our ideas DO end up backfiring (see: [$PRPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jcbj0n/final_score_on_prplw_32m_gain/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3])), and MAYBE 85% of the members don‚Äôt know what theta decay is, but we do *not* pull stocks out of thin air, as you‚Äôve claimed.

People here genuinely believe in these stocks. People here believe in Ryan Cohen, and the potential for GameStop to be reinvented. People believe in Blackberry‚Äôs future (present) as a rock solid software company. This brings me to my final issue:

It is disingenuous and plainly incorrect to blame every. single. price increase. on the ‚Äúreddit rebellion‚Äù and short squeezes. STOP saying we are going after $BBBY ‚Äì there hasn‚Äôt been a substantive post in 4 months on that. STOP saying we are pumping $NOK ‚Äì we‚Äôve advocated for leap calls in NOK for MONTHS because *we know* we cannot wait out their giant share float. And for JPow‚Äôs sake, ***STOP BLAMING US FOR A***\[movie company\]***MC, EX***\[clothing store\]***PR, AND IRBT. TWO OF THOSE TICKERS ARE LITERALLY BANNED FROM THIS SUBREDDIT, AND THE OTHER ISN‚ÄôT EVEN REAL TO US. WE CANT EVEN TYPE THEM INTO A POST WITHOUT GETTING AUTO-DELETED.***  People who try to pump a stock for no reason are BANNED.  Yes, because of the events of this month, and because of the actions of groups like Citron, many people are happily engaging in one particular short squeeze. But that‚Äôs it. Yes, retail is more powerful than you may know, but we are not *that* powerful.

If you or anyone else reading this are wondering why there seems to be more internet chatter on that *one* particular movie company, hear this: *SOMEONE* has been creating fake accounts and BOTS to spam and pump up \[movie company\] and $nok, etc. to distract from GME. Ask the admins. Look at Chamath‚Äôs twitter replies. Look at **ALL** OF FINANCE TWITTER. There are newly created accounts and bots spamming the hell out of these other stocks in an effort to *manipulate* the market and save the shorts. Jeez, I wonder who is behind that? **Could it be the same group of people who bought $1.2million of GME puts right before** [**tweeting something?**](https://t.co/Fz1aTbMa2p?amp=1)

If anyone in the void is reading this, thanks. The point of this post was just to fight back in a tiny way against the days and days of whining millionaires on TV berating people they literally know nothing about. It‚Äôs to point out the ignorance of self-serving boomers saying things like ‚Äúthe SEC needs to regulate  *the* Reddit‚Äù, etc. The point of this post was just to get our little corner of truth out there in the world, because we all know that truth is in short supply. üöÄ

I am your local commie cuckmaster the Gay Bear! And I have important bullshit for you to hate me for.

But first things first. Good job with GME! Those bastards at Melvin and Citron don't deserve the title of Gay Bear. They spew lies and spread propaganda in order to decimate companies, and now it looks like GameStop is on the way to completely revolutionize their business model all thanks to you!

Now back to my commie bullshit.

While you autists have been hyperfixated on GME, the rest of the market decided to take a dump. SPY broke a bound it's been holding on to since last November. Also, the Pring's Special K indicator is closely approaching a lower bound. If you don't trust this indicator, I can assure you that I have done lots of Special K (the hose tranquilizing kind) when a flying midget told me that I can trust it. 

Now that you know it's real, it's time to wildly speculate on why the market would react like this. First of all, if anyone hates commies  more than you, it's hedge fund managers and market movers. They think that communism is when the government takes away their money and gives it to ingrates like you. What a bunch of idiots. 

Now that they think you're basically worse than china, they would rather bring down the whole system out of spite than to acknowledge that you've won.

Also, remember that the orange haired troll printed off money wherever his micropenis pointed to, and now the senile hair sniffer is worried about something called a ""deficit"" whatever the fuck that is. 

So with that, if SPY doesn't recover tomorrow I'm going to drop whatever I've been holding on to and go balls deep on GME, BB, and AMC calls.

Thank you Matt Phillips and Taylor Lorenz for enacting the same level of distain for us as the hedge fundies our tax dollars bailed out after the Great Recession. 

You mischaracterized both the type of people involved in this action (literate, engaged, working poor to middle-class) and the action itself (is it greedy to spend our paychecks wringing dry hedge funds who daily manipulate the markets in milliseconds while we are forced to drop a few bucks here and there and hope for the best?).

There is a palpable elitism at play here, and a deeper concern that rests not with those risking real money during a pandemic for the shot at a better life but for the goddamn MMs and collective arbiters of financial advice and financial institutions beneath whose thumbs we've been placed to squirm long enough. This is a handful of stocks we're using to kneecap some idiot short sellers and you're insinuating that we're about to collapse the whole system. 

We're not. We can't. These motherfuckers can, and have. We're fighting for a piece of the damn pie.

Make up whatever story gets you the headline, ""[above the fold](https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1354635872180662273),"" as you so deliciously revel in bragging about. I hope you both learn from this. Because you didn't even bother to spend any time here listening to what these working folks have been shouting into every post on the board, shouting on Twitter, on Facebook, into our phones as we watch the stock green dick rocket every hour on Robinhood: ""THIS ISN'T ONLY ABOUT THE MONEY!""

&#x200B;

I was in my early teens during the '08 crisis. I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.

Those close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.

To Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.

To CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/). They include, but are not limited to, **IBM**, **Cisco**, **TMobile**, **JPMorgan**, **Oracle**, and **ZipRecruiter**. Their parent company is [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal), owned by **Comcast** and **GE**.

To the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these ""millennial blog posts"": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? *We're not enemies, we're on the same side*. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.

To WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.

**Okay Autists. I know this is long, with a lot of numbers and concepts, but bear with me. This is good stuff.**

When I was watching the trading today on GME, I noticed something strange regarding the price action and the volume. If you noticed overall today, GME traded around 94 Million shares total. Yesterday total shares were 178 Million. Day before that 177 Million. Day before that, 197 Million. The day before that, 93 Million. Ever since we started ripping up in price, the volume has been around 200 million shares per day. But today, when the price was so high, and with so much volatility (change in price), the total volume was only 94 Million!!! If you look at the one minute chart, by the end of the day average volume per minute was 98 K / minute. And during these crazy downward dips throughout the day, the volume was sometimes as low as 8K. 8k out of 50 million float = 0.016%. That means 0.016% of the total shares changed the price so much!! This doesn‚Äôt make sense. Yesterday‚Äôs average volume/ minute was 500K per minute. Which makes sense for the crazy price movement we had yesterday.

**I think the reason why we had crazy lows and highs today was because of short selling.**

Short selling from day traders who want to make quick profits in the day and get out by the end. Once we hit $385/ share (premarket high ‚Äì day trading short sellers like to use premarket high as a good short starting point because they know a lot of long day traders and paperhanded autists will sell at that point), the short selling day traders came in and started shorting hard to make their quick profits. That‚Äôs why you see the borrowed shares on iborrowdesk.com low around these times. And you have been seeing it fluctuate throughout the last few days. So I think these day trading short sellers were pushing the stock down the whole time, and when the end of the day approached, they covered their position, and we went back up to 344 close, and 373 (close to premarket high where we dropped during the day) during the first minute of after hours.

**Why is this good?**

Because that shows us these massive dips in the day are not because large amounts of autists and every day people are selling, but because the day trader shorts are synthetically pushing the price down. That means we‚Äôve been diamond handing. And even better, the normies are all diamond handing too. Guys, this is on the verge of the squeeze! Don‚Äôt sell and let this shit ride. I believe if we can push past 385 tomorrow, this shit will rip, as no short selling day trader will want to risk getting squeezed. And the crazy enough ones that do will trigger moderate length shorters to cover. Which will have the stock break out higher. Causing the breakout and momentum traders to come join us for the fight. Shit‚Äôs gonna rip. One hedge fund gets liquidated‚Ä¶ more covering‚Ä¶ another hedge fund. 

**Domino effect guys. Game over.**

Some of you may argue that TDameritrade and other brokers prevented trading GME, so that‚Äôs why the volume was low. But check this out, AMC was on that TDameritrade block list too! And they traded 1.19 Billion shares today. That‚Äôs billion with a B. With the average share per minute 2 million/ minute. And we only traded 197 Million. This is not normal. Not normal for a stock that‚Äôs breaking headlines.

There are legitimately WSB millionaires made off this one play. This is history, and I'm glad to have witnessed it.

But I'm seeing a worrying trend here. People are beginning to make this into a moral crusade against ""the man"". Taking down the hedge funds because of their over-greed is no longer a way to make crazy money, it's a moral imperative. Giving advice to hold GME forever, just to punish them.

WSB is not the only thing driving GME up. WSB first noticed it and so we got in early, but other players are also involved. We cannot squeeze Melvin to infinity. Eventually, the position will be closed.

I don't know where the top of GME is. It might be $500. It might be $1000. It might be $10,000. But eventually, the stock will revert to its fundamental value. It happens with every short squeeze every time. And someone is going to be caught holding the bag.

If you are one of those ""I'm holding forever"" people, that person losing all their money is going to be you. The stock is going to crash from $100,000 or wherever it ends up, and when you finally decide to sell Robinhood is going to freeze for 15 minutes and it will congratulate you on your $6 sell. Meanwhile the institutional investor with their real broker made a killing. 

Now I can't wait for the loss porn that is coming to this sub in a month any more than the rest of you. That's what this sub is about. But when that happens, remember, it wasn't ""the man"" who made you lose all your money. You were the one who decided to hold at GME $1,000,000 to fuck Melvin. And you loved the feeling of that green dildo so much that you didn't notice the giant red one coming straight for your ass.

&#x200B;

üíéüôåüöÄüöÄ\*\*TLDR at the bottom.\*\*üöÄüöÄüíéüôå

&#x200B;

I do not think that you all here realize that we have essentially won yesterday at 9:58 AM and that we almost crashed the entire thing. There was a post here describing a [""30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb""](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

In this post, they described and expressed their outrage with the Interactive Brokers Chairman interview.

# THEY ARE CORRECT!

There was ANOTHER interview with  [Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RS4JIEVyXM&feature=youtu.be) that I did not see that received  as much attention here.

In this interview, it is a bit longer **(** **must watch imo).**

It explains *some* of the ambiguity with the previous interviews with Vlad from Robinhood and what happened in general.

# It confirms that:

1. THEY HAD A LIQUIDITY PROBLEM
2. THE SHORTS  ARE STARTING TO GO BUST
3. THE BROKERS ARE ON THE HOOK TO GET SHARES THAT THEIR CLIENTS CANT GET
4. THE BROKERS THEMSELVES CANNOT COVER THESE POSITIONS PROPERLY
5. THE CLEARING HOUSE ALSO CANNOT COVER AND ARE GETTING LOANS FROM THE BANKS DUE TO THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

&#x200B;

Essentially, we **liked** the stock so much üöÄüöÄüöÄ  that the shorties (all my homies hate melvin capital and shitron) blew up so fast that the BROKERS could not properly margin call them in time.  THEY COULD NOT LIQUIDATE THEM IN TIME TO GET THEM TO COVER THEIR POSITIONS IN TIME.

Now, the brokers are on the hook to go get the shares for you if their clients cannot. THIS is why there is a margin call and margin maintenance to avoid this from happening. But we BLEW past all of this so fast that they are now on the hook since their clients the  **üåàüêª** now cannot get the share that they legally need to provide you.

Since these brokers are large, they usually have the capital to cover these losses and get the shares themselves. As [Thomas Peterffy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM&feature=youtu.be) flexes that he has billions to cover. When I heard it first has made me raise my eyebrows since why would he flex this number and then highlight the 15billion losses. Then it hit me... **THEY CANNOT COVER THESE POSITIONS.** These brokers are starting to not be able to clear these transactions so their clearing house does it for them.

The clearing house in short makes sure that when you sell your share you get your money in your account. They usually have about 1-2% of capital requirements for the stock that is being traded to make sure that they can settle the transaction. HOWEVER, for GME it is raised to a 100%.

**THE CLEARING HOUSE CANNOT SETTLE THESE TRANSACTIONS!**

Once Robinhood's clearinghouse went down the transactions started getting routed through Webull's clearing house ( I belive it is [Apex](https://www.apexclearing.com/) that they use). They almost IMMEDIATELY had to put a halt on it because they could not settle the transactions.

THEY STARTED TAKING LOANS FROM BANKS TO KEEP THEMSELVES FROM HALTING THE **ENTIRE** STOCK MARKET.

# THE ENTIRE STOCK MARKET WAS ABOUT TO COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEY WERE ABOUT TO NOT BE ABLE TO SETTLE THE TRANSACTIONS!

# THERE IS NOT ENOUGH STOCK TO GO AROUND!

At this point, what that all means is that THERE IS not enough stock to go around and the LOSES of these  **üåàüêª** are so **LARGE** that the brokers cannot get the shares that they are legally bound to do. And their CLEARING HOUSE cannot do it either.

THIS IS WHY THEY STOPPED YOU FROM BUYING BUT ALLOWED SELLING.

They used the short ladder attack and essentially in a low volume caused the price to drop by trading in between themselves to a point where they were sort of able to cover some losses. **BUT,**

IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS SHORT LADDER ATTACK,

The most beautiful thing happened...

# EVERYONE HELD:

(From [Luis Rossmann's Video (6:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enLiJfijWBI) )

[Bid vs Ask price difference is massive!](https://preview.redd.it/oaf0eab8m8e61.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb0bc1d6774794c8641d9e9aec287e42fc19e2f0)

Look at that difference between BID and ASK.

I love ALL of you.

You all  üíéüôå  that shit so hard!

&#x200B;

You , yes **YOU** reading this , because **you** üíéüôå that shit the price did not drop further. Because of every single one of you, they were not able to cover their positions.

&#x200B;

What this all means is that we are close to winning and we will not only take out the greedy **üåàüêª hedge fund üåàüêª** managers but also THE BROKERS, THE CLEARING HOUSES and the WHOLE THING.

&#x200B;

Now, this all means that we are very, very VERY close to winning. At this point, IF we manage to get all these options to exercise in the money today, it will be 15million -20 million shares that will have to be bought up by the market makers ( this is the gamma squeeze that is probably going to happen today and would then cause **the SQUEEZE** to the moon üöÄ)

&#x200B;

At this point,  I plan to hold and you should too.

If we keep drying out these clearing houses, brokers like fidelity do not have clearing houses and there you should be able to buy freely. The more we clear them out the more they will have to cover and we have a chance for a real financial revolution.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR:

The brokers have let their **üåàüêª  clientsüåàüêª** lose so much money so fast that they were not able to margin call them in time and now they are on the hook to provide the shares.

The losses are so large that THEY the BROKER are not able to provide the share and then the clearing house has to do it.

THE CLEARING HOUSE CANNOT PROVIDE THE SHARES because of the capital requirements for GME and they are borrowing from the banks.

This is creating a liquidity problem that can affect the entire market. Buy them out and then buy on brokers like Fidelity that do not have a clearing house.

This is why they stopped allowing GME to be bought but you could still sell it because they wanted to save their own asses.

Everyone here managed to üíéüôå  so hard that caused the price to stop falling and the BID/ASK price to increase drastically.

I am buying and holding.

üöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄüöÄ üöÄGME to the moon üöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄüöÄ üöÄ

I have 15 shares @ $40.44 (not much I know but I am gonna reload asap) and I am planning to sell 10%-20% at $10k and hold to sell the rest of my position at $42,069.69/share

&#x200B;

EDIT:

I should have made it more clear, for people that are asking about what to do if they do the same halt on buys, use brokers that do not rely on clearing house like Fidelity

&#x200B;

Hedge fund Cormark was fined ü•ú ($800.000) by the SEC for reporting a short position as a long position, for over a year.

There is hardly any downside to lying for these hedge funds.   
They stand to get a ü•ú fine, but if they correctly report their perhaps 300% short, they stand to go bankrupt. 

They have already shown that they are willing to stop at nothing to kill retail.  
When short reporting time comes, and the short percent is 50%, DON'T BELIEVE THE LIES!

I like the GME stock. I have $26k locked and loaded for the short ladder today.

That is not entirely true. 

RH is allowing anyone with ZERO shares of GME to buy up to 5.  Anyone with currently less than 5 shares can buy more up to a total portfolio of 5 shares.  Anyone with more than 5 shares can not purchase shares. 

This is important because these fuck clowns know that those of us carrying greater numbers of stock likely have the capacity to buy greater numbers of GME shares and reduce liquidity. 

They are simultaneously:
1)  manipulating the system
2) taking advantage of people with less funds
3) preventing a greater number of shares from being purchased

They did this so they could have a talking point in the media and during their congressional investigations and say ‚ÄúWe reopened stock purchase of GME‚Äù and nobody will dig deeper. 

This is fucking dirty ass pool and fucking outright manipulation. 

Here‚Äôs the video proof:  https://imgur.com/a/AV3IGMa

Edit: and yes.  I do have other brokerage accounts and those are working fine. Shout out to my homies at SoFi, Fidelity, and Vanguard. I have GME stashed in those accounts too.

Edit 2: I‚Äôm not giving a pass to those fucks at other brokers too. Thomas ‚ÄúThe Shit Engine‚Äù Fluffer at IBKR can eat a bag of fucking rotten cocks too.  Saying GME is worth $17 and the stock should be restricted until it drops to $17 because it‚Äôs overvalued.  Fuck you Fluffer. You know what‚Äôs overvalued at $17? Your shitty blowjobs. You give really shitty head you old lemon party fuck. ^no ^homo

Edit 3: RH has now dropped the shares you can buy to 2 shares. If you hold more than 2 shares you can not buy shares.  Go use another broker.  Fuck IBKR, Fuck RH and fuck the hedge funds and brokers.  They are gaming this entire thing.  Go ahead share this post with anyone not on reddit.  Everyone needs to know they are being bent over and violated without lube.  Market got caught doing retarded shit (shorting over 200% of GME) and now we all are suddenly the retards.  GO GET FUCKED Vlad the Cock Impaler and Thomas Fluffer and all of you fuck clowns.

Edit 4: Dear SEC - When GME was trading and trending above $350 is when RH and others dropped the share buy limit to 2 shares.  This is coordinated and planned manipulation.  $350 matters because if GME continues to trade consistently above $350 then gamma squeeze occurs for todays closing options.  This is coordinated and premeditated manipulation.

Here‚Äôs the proof of the new 2 share limit: https://i.imgur.com/RhwgoRu.jpg

#Edit 5: I made a comment that RH was stealing a share from my account.  We all have moments of retardation.  Some of us, like me, dwell in the retard.  I was wrong and I appreciate other redditors pointing out my mistake.  I've delete the comments and posts I made elsewhere.  RH has done enough shit wrong but disinformation, unintentional or not, is not what we are about.  I apologize for the honest mistake.  But fuck RH, IBKR, and the hedge funds anyway.  Nothing changes.

#I'm NOT FUCKING SELLING.

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 3 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Tues or Wed next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 120% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

This is an unprecedented moment in Financial history. The establishment is balls deep in each others' arses and we saw that in the Citadel-Robinhood-Point72-StevenCohen collusion yesterday.

For those who missed what happened: Robinhood and other brokerage platforms coordinated a short attack on the retail investor by blocking buy orders and allowing only sell orders. This resulted in a near evaporation of buying volume and panic selling from a lot of understandably concerned stock holders.

It can be construed that this was happening on the orders of the great Citadel, who may have profited off opening short positions at the top. This was seen and caught by multiple order flow traders who noticed block trades. 

*A short ladder*

A short ladder was initiated. They closed the gates to retail and then block sold orders in the open market to drive down the prices. They did this between hedge funds A, B and C to maintain positions while profiting off their short positions (initiated at ATH). This can also be cross checked by looking at yesterday's volume, which was truly minimal. These HFs engineered the short ladder to use the low price to cover their short positions for cheap. Yet, the short interest dipped only marginally (from 140 percent to 120 percent) 

The idea was to have retail offload as many shares as possible to increase float, which will make covering the short positions easy. So now we know that this is what they want. They want us to sell. And they will try a variety of tricks to make us sell. The short ladder was one of those. 

So what can we do? And how will it matter? 

We do the opposite of what they want us to. We don't sell. How will this help the short squeeze? 

Not selling (and letting the buyers pile in) will add to the buying pressure. It will also reduce float. 

So when the shorts do choose to cover, they will need to buy again, and again, and again to cover their entire position.

So hear me out here let's do some quick math. Short interest (no of shares shorted/ no of available in float) = 120 percent. There are more shares shorted than exist to be bought. 

Investors like Burry and Cohen further reduce this float by piling in. In reality, the short is a good multiple of the float (this is my hunch). We have caught them by the balls and have a chance of changing the status quo. 

All you have to do is Hold and not increase the share float. Shorting Gamestop is becoming more expensive by the minute. The shorters need to pay their brokers margin to borrow shares too. By reducing float, we can make these HFs bleed more. 

By holding the line, we make HFs taste blood.

Don't be pussy paper hand small dick. I'm again balls deep in BB since last monday (only 30k which is what I have). I'll never fuckin sell.

Today I've putted 5k on GME just cause I fuckin love you and I'm with you all along. Just for the cause. I prefer to lose 5k on GME than spending them in videogames or shit like that.

Bail out both sides by liquidating the hedge funds, but not the brokers or clearinghouses, but also put a buy order in for $10k per share to allow GME shareholders to exit.  Isn‚Äôt $700 billion better than a financial meltdown?  Just like last time you can ‚Äòput rules in place to make sure this won‚Äôt happen again‚Äô

In 2008 the banks held risky assets and got bailed out because they said the innocent normal people would be hurt even more if you didn‚Äôt bail them out, so the government did it.  

We posed a risk to the liquidity of the hedge funds, brokers, and clearinghouses yesterday.  By bankrupting them it would probably cause a temporary stock market crash as they liquidate their positions.  

Are we not now in the same position as the banks were in 2008?  Buy us out of our positions for $700 billion to save the rest of the market and the normal people right?

Edit because it got attention:  if this ever was a reality it would in the form of a loan to clearinghouses and brokers to cover any losses up to $10k per share.  They would have to pay it back over time.  The government would get the money back and reimburse taxpayers, while at the same time collecting taxes from the gains of the retail investors. Long term the clearinghouses and brokers recover, the market continues to function,  and then they never let hedge funds put on a risky play like that ever again. The hedge funds involved are deservedly bankrupt, and the retail traders get the reward they deserve by playing the free market game by the rules."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185649.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['GME']|['GME']

My question is - I can probably afford a few hours, but what if we buy it out until the end of the week, the month, hell, even the year? I did the math, it's not that expensive to run it for 1 hour per day and the impact will be way higher than putting that money in the stock. 

I'll do it anyway for Monday-Tuesday, but if this catches on, I plan to keep it going. Just looking for some feedback now. 

THIS IS THE WAY?"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185654.csv|StockTicker|['ASDAQ']|[]|['I', 'I', 'NY', 'I', 'ASDAQ', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'THIS', 'IS', 'THE', 'WAY']|[]

Not only, they also put the wrong birthday. So every time I tried to setup a brokerage account, it said I was entering the wrong credentials. 

I called Fidelity and they told me I was going to have to submit a paper application to correct the incorrect birthday. I said I'll do that, but I'll probably try to find someone else, because I'm trying to get my assets out of my Robin Hood account. He asked to put me on hold to see if there was something he could do in the back office. He put me on with someone with the 401k department (he stayed on the line while I talked to her). In the end, she told me I was going to have to do a paper application too. He thanked her for her help and told me to stay on the line so he could see if he could try something else. Best fucking customer service. He helped walk me through creating an account, changed my birthday, and walked me through get a transfer set up for my assets at Robin Hood.  The customer service is such a refresher from the nightmare we've had to deal with with Robin Hood.

I love capitalism. The power of competition. Fuck Robin Hood.

Edit: Anyone know how to fill out a customer service survey? I got the guy's name and want to let Fidelity know how impressed I was with him."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185652.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']|[]

I know it's Friday and some of you short-term monkey brains are thinking about bailing on your brothers. Your paper hands are beginning to cramp up. I get it. **BUT WE CANNOT SELL!**  


There are still **MASSIVE** amounts of shorts on $GME. Still well over 113% of total shares floated (*from S3 Partners*). Some old shorts have gotten out, but many **NEW** shorts have taken their place in the past couple of days hoping that $GME will die out.  


# Here is the key part...

They are literally PRAYING for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. They are HOPING that they can make back their money at our expense... **BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THEY HOLD THEIR SHORT POSITIONS IS COSTING THEM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY!!!**  


# BILLIONS A DAY.

All we need to do is **HOLD**. That's it. We will cost them so much money today, next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and on and on. Soon enough they won't be able to pay the cost of their shorts or it just won't be worth the cost anymore and they will all eventually have to bail. **THAT IS GOING TO BE THE SQUEEZE**. Once the costs keep adding up, they will start to bail and the rest will follow.  


WE MUST STAY STRONG. DON‚ÄôT FORGET WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US. IT'S A GAME OF CHICKEN. WHOEVER BLINKS FIRST.. LOSES.  
We're not fucking blinking.

I remember when the housing collapse sent a torpedo through my family. My father's concrete company collapsed almost overnight. My father lost his home. My uncle lost his home. I remember my brother helping my father count pocket change on our kitchen table. That was all the money he had left in the world. While this was happening in my home, I saw hedge funders literally drinking champagne as they looked down on the Occupy Wall Street protestors. I will never forget that.

My Father never recovered from that blow. He fell deeper and deeper into alcoholism and exists now as a shell of his former self, waiting for death.

 This is all the money I have and I'd rather lose it all than give them what they need to destroy me. Taking money from me won't hurt me, because i don't value it at all. I'll burn it all down just to spite them.

This is for you, Dad.

This is false. You are buying and selling from real people or algorithms that believe they can scalp your order. The idealized scenario is that GME rallies, Melvin covers, and everyone at reddit gets out at the top. This represents a misunderstanding of market mechanics. Melvin will cover before we truly know it, and the crash will happen as quick as the rally.

So with recent events, you must ask yourself:

# Who is Your Counterparty?

Nothing is a sure bet. How confident are you that your counterparty is who you think it is? Thousands of redditors & new traders beyond have been buying stocks fully confident that Melvin Capital hasn't  exited their trade. This is also supported by some analysis provided by two different firms, although their estimates differ some amount. Confounded in this is the interpretation of the data: Does this include market makers and dealers that are short stock but covered with calls or options deltas? Is their information fully accurate in an event the likes of which has never happened? It's tough to know for sure. 

# Know Everyone's Hand

Your guess on *how much they've covered* and *when they covered* has a massive effect on how you perceive the value of this trade. Buying if you think Melvin has $10b notional to cover is a much better bet than if they only have $2b to cover. You also have to consider how much notional the rest of the market has bought in anticipation of a squeeze. The difference between the two represents your effective edge.

Remember, we don't *actually* know Melvin's current position. We don't know what's going on behind closed doors. We only know the hand they're showing us via media. Has their clearing firm taken over? Has a much bigger collection of firms absorbed the position? Have they been buying since Monday? Have they covered and have new funds entered the space at a much better level? 

You are fighting Goliath at a poker table in the city of Gath. The pot is worth $25 billion dollars. Ken Griffin has *never* lost. Melvin's prime brokers Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche are not used to losing (well, Deutsche is). They will do whatever it takes to take the pot *from you* and leave you holding the bag. They will not blink twice because there is a *lot* of *fucking money* on the line.

# Know What Can Go Wrong

Nobody could have guessed everything that happened this week. Prepare yourself for the unexpected. Your brokerage will undoubtedly close out your position at the worst possible time. The stock could be halted for days. You could be assigned on ITM options. Your stock could get delisted. Your stock may get diluted.

# Only Spend What You're Willing to Lose

This one is self explanatory. Your investment could go to zero. Even if you think you make money on every trade, if your bet size is 100%, the long term value of your portfolio is **zero*****.***

# Don't Take Out Loans on Emotional Capital

If you are new, you really don't know the gut-wrenching, stomach-turning feeling of seeing the possibility of your net liquidity hitting zero or negative. It fucking sucks. You just know the highs. You're buying along the speculative frenzy and frantic rallies, wrapped in anti-billionaire & pro-underdog themes. It may even feel good to think that a guy who cut his teeth at a firm notorious for an insider trading scandal is getting his comeuppance. We love the feeling. **If you are fully invested financially & emotionally, you are completely overleveraged and will pay the price.** Make feeling good your goal, and set limits that you can stomach. 

There are several feel-good stories of people making life-changing money to pay off their student loans or their family members' surgeries. Please think twice about this, and only spend what you can afford to lose. If placing a bet makes the difference between your pet living or dying, you may have a gambling problem. These were success stories because they got in at a much better level and could have had a much sadder ending.

Secondly, don't take it personal. There are people on the other side of your trades, your brokerage support line, the subreddit, the media. They are all playing their own hand to the best of their knowledge. It's easy to blame a broker, yell at their support desk, hate-tweet at a company, or even rage-text that guy you know who develops APIs at ETrade. A lot of people across the industry are *rooting* for you. Fuck, even Ted Cruz and AOC are *rooting* for you, because this transcends politics. If you're mad at Melvin Capital or Ken Griffin or the guys who crashed the economy in 2008, keep it that way. They will try and misdirect your anger in every single direction: brokerages, the media, and reddit. If your enemies are a few guys at the top holding a $25b short position and moving levers, keep it that way. 

Thirdly, if you don't want to be a human being for the sake of the person on the other side, be a human being for your wallet's sake. You make better financial decisions in the absence of emotions."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185646.csv|StockTicker|['A']|[]|['GME', 'ITM', 'A', 'AOC']|['GME']

1-Even though buying seems to be back, it can change again in any moment and your orders may not fill. When the dip comes again, AND IT WILL, DO NOT SELL. You may think you can sell all your positions and buy back in on the cheap, BUT THERES NO GUARANTEE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BUY BACK IN. JUST HOLD AND WE WIN. DONT BELIEVE ANY SHORT FLOAT LIES TODAY.

2-Our buying preassure is low today thanks to rh fucking us, and mainly because most of us are already holding. At this point its a game of waiting them out and NOT pussying out in their attacks.

3-Melvin fucked up with this whole situation, but these guys are NOT stupid. They have harvard mathmaticians and professional risk analysts. They probably figured out that their losses will be marginally LESS for holding their positions open and paying the borrowing fees than it would be if they covered now. They want to wear us down over time by blocking us from buying, sniping stop losses with ladders and constant media attacks like that sellout Cramer saying the squeeze is over. ALL we have to do is hold, and we will win. If you keep selling, they can slowly cover over time while keeping the price steady.

Credit to [u/Pcbuildingnoob699](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pcbuildingnoob699/) \-- I'm rephrasing so it's just pure information/education and not financial advice.THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, THIS IS PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.

When might you want to sell? A quick guide for GME noobs.TL;DR: DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå

&#x200B;

Too much disinformation about when to sell. We are seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (WHICH IS ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT IN YOUR FINANCIAL INTEREST) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how some smart investors will play the ending. \[Note: I u/TheKageyOne, will not be selling at all, at least not for a long time. I'm in this to hurt the shorts, send a message, and watch GME grow and restructure into a totally new e-commerce and brick and mortar business in the coming years).

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

* imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.
* Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to **START** covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's **NOT** gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If people hold GME stocks play it right and hold while shorts cover, they can literally squeeze this to infinity as the shorts try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND DO WITH THIS INFORMATION WHAT YOU WILL. A LOT OF YOU ARE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

Edit: Yes, I realize the days to cover reported in those links is actually lower now. I don't know enough to tell you what is accurate. I do know enough to tell you that if an investor buys and holds a share, there are fewer shares available for the shorts to cover with, so holding drives up the Days to Cover.

Why This Weekend Is So Crucial...

Ok listen up retards... I know it's Friday and some of you short-term monkey brains are thinking about bailing on your brothers. Your paper hands are beginning to cramp up. I get it. **BUT WE CANNOT SELL!**  


There are still **MASSIVE** amounts of shorts on $GME. Still well over 113% of total shares floated (*from S3 Partners*). Some old shorts have gotten out, but many **NEW** shorts have taken their place in the past couple of days hoping that $GME will die out.  


# Here is the key part...

They are literally PRAYING for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. They are HOPING that they can make back their money at our expense... **BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THEY HOLD THEIR SHORT POSITIONS IS COSTING THEM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY!!!**  


# BILLIONS A DAY.

All we need to do is **HOLD**. That's it. We will cost them so much money today, next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and on and on. Soon enough they won't be able to pay the cost of their shorts or it just won't be worth the cost anymore and they will all eventually have to bail. **THAT IS GOING TO BE THE SQUEEZE**. Once the costs keep adding up, they will start to bail and the rest will follow.  


WE MUST STAY STRONG. DON‚ÄôT FORGET WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US. IT'S A GAME OF CHICKEN. WHOEVER BLINKS FIRST.. LOSES.  
We're not fucking blinking.  


**TL/DR: HOLD. HOLD. HOLD. THIS WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK IS CRUCIAL!**

They have to cover their shorts at some point in time. Why do you think they only disabled purchases yesterday?

If the price was static, with no market movement, hedge funds would lose. Even if you took your orders off the market to buy, they can‚Äôt manipulate the stock low enough to save themselves.

Think about it: the hedge funds have to go long at some point in time to cover. All we have to do is wait and let them kill themselves in the process.

Why?!? Because now there are thousands of people who have a higher purchasing power. That means a lot more money will be spent in local businesses, shopping centers, car dealerships, etc. It will more evenly be distributed among the masses. It will also be taxed which means more money for government assistance programs and infrastructure, and all the other bullshit government spends on. It seems to me that this is more about ego and precedent than the actual dollar value for these market makers pushing against the squeeze. They stand to lose 11.2 billion, which to us seems like a lot but to them doesn‚Äôt even amount to a drop in the bucket. Long story short I think common sense says this will galvanize our economy.

GME continues to be a Carollian experience. Through this looking-glass, there is a world where stock prices do not reflect the value of the underlying companies whose partial ownership is traded through common stock. To some, the market is, more or less, broken, for now. That's not a good or a bad thing. The market mechanism is not supposed to make an implicit judgment. There is information in price, but that information is difficult to divine and interpret. Markets aren't good, bad, rational or irrational: they just are.

  When one group takes action in a market to alter the playing field, the market is not a pure market anymore. It's lost 'integrity' and loses more with every modification. This typically only happens in moments of crisis or technological change: countries ban short-selling, for instance; exchanges will unwind clear 'fat-finger' trades, etc; speed bumps may make the market more 'fair' for the technologically behind. We're learning more about how markets can have what appear to be 'unintended' consequences (flash crashes, GME-style reverse crashes), or can be 'gamed' (spoofing, quant as a whole), but we're back to square one: markets don't have feelings. The rules are simple: post your price, the amount, and the rest is order-matching. All of the rest are modifications against the spirit of the laws of the jungle.
  
So, like you, I'm disgusted by what happened the other day. My guess is the DTC and others required incremental collateral for clearing any GME trades--this required RH to raise capital. I actually don't think RH is to blame here! Every broker did the same thing, so there must be a root cause. I mentioned something like this may happen the other day, and I repeat my admonition to not trade on margin. I suspect GME long buying will require 100% margin at virtually any broker. Brokers have to protect themselves, but they can be influenced by the rest of the parties in their food chain, as we saw.

  GME is still worthless compared to its current price. Keep that in mind. You're buying a flower, a baseball card, a beanie baby, a photocopy of a Picasso, all for prices that you know are a lot more--not just a lot more, but insanely more--than anything close to what it could be worth. Those are the facts: GME is just a shitty retailer that will struggle to survive, let alone become a business worth 20 or 30 billion dollars. All of the Ryan Cohen transformation stuff is BS relative to the price change. A good team may be able to turn around GME to the point where it is worth $40, MAYBE. It'll never be worth $300, or at least, the probability that GME operations could support a reasonable price like that is about as small as my odds of becoming a MLB starting pitcher.
 
 That doesn't mean the stock can't go up. The world is conflating what a market is by trying to assign it implicit judgment. Traders have the right to buy and sell anything they'd like for any price that they'd like. One man's ""bubble"" is another man's ""deep value."" I bought a rap CD for millions of dollars. That's my right. Did I overpay? Well, that's really not a judgment anyone can make, is it? If I paid $10,000,000 for a baseball card which is well-known to trade for $5, then it seems clear I've overpaid, right?
  
No. Speculators buy assets for many reasons. Sometimes its because they're making a value judgment: this is WORTH more than my purchase price. But what does that imply? What is worth or value? Most speculators (I suppose you can define that as a buyer who has an explicit intention to sell at a later date, probably soon) buy things because they are confident they can sell at a higher price soon. The value judgment is secondary, and sometimes not relevant at all. Speculators are the animating spirit of the market. If you curb the ability for speculators to act, you have a farcical excuse of a market. But, you can't blame a clearing broker for saying, ""what happens if your client can't clear this trade?"". The stock just went from 300 to 150--what if your client is broke? To me, the simple answer there is to require 100% margin. Limiting the ability for someone to buy a stock for 100% margin (literally the cash to cover the trade is set aside) smells awful. I wouldn't bother with conspiracies--they won't help you trade well.
  
Many of you are brand new to the world of trading. I've traded my whole life--it is very, very hard. I am not very good at it, to be frank. I do think I'm a very good value investor, and in biotech, an extremely good binary-event trader. 99% of people, including in finance, are not good traders. 99% of people are not good 'value' investors, either. That doesn't mean you shouldn't want to become one or try. But it is inordinately difficult. There's nothing wrong with hobbies or 'side gigs', but I really think you should think about the market like a professional sport, or fighting/boxing league, where you are permitted to 'play with the pros'. It doesn't make too much sense to 'part time' fight Brock Lesnar or take LeBron 1-on-1. But this is what you're doing when you trade. Be careful.
  
For those newish to trading, here is my advice on some reading materials:

1) Market Wizards series. This is one of the best series on great investors/traders, which takes you into the mind of the successful trader, in their words. It's always by the same author (JS), too, who is very experienced and knowledgable.
    
2) Trading to Win by Ari Kiev. Read it. Probably the best book on the theory of trading ever written.
    
3) AVOID most books on trading. Unless there is a reason to read them that you can really digest, they're probably empty wastes of time at best, or at worse, could mislead you into some terrible strategy. You can't go wrong reading the books by or about people who have made fortunes in the market. But always take everything as a grain of salt. AVOID the opinions of others in general. This sounds self-referential, but will make a little bit more sense after reading 1/2.
  
When you read these books, you'll realize that my life of 'value investing' is basically irrelevant to the near-term of the stock market, especially in situations like GME or TSLA. GME will probably go down over time, as I mentioned, because it is wildly overvalued and, generally, wildly overvalued stocks tend to go down over time. That doesn't have to be true. That's why investors diversify and 'stop-loss' and do other things to protect themselves. You should do all of that, too. My style, and those of others, simply relate the price of something to the amount of cash it can generate. That's value investing in a nutshell, and it is what the entire industry of Private Equity (Blackstone, Apollo, Carlyle, etc.) is all about. Hedge Funds and Mutual Funds do a little of this as well, but to decide whether a stock will go up or down is this dark art called 'trading'. The ""next"" Steve Cohen might be being born right here, right now, in WallStreetBets. Who knows.
  
I still think GME will trade at 1,000. Why? I am guessing, like all of you, and every other trader out there. No one knows anything. As I mentioned, the borrow interest rate is what I think is important to watch. You're at a disadvantage to other traders in that respect: hedge funds can pull up that information through phone calls, contacts, etc. which you are hopeless to compete against. It doesn't mean they're going to make money and you won't. It's just something to think about. I like 1,000: it's a big round number that is meaningful in the psychology of the markets, to a very small extent. It may trade there for 5 seconds, or it may trade there and keep going higher. For some reason, I think the stock has a bit of ""destiny"" to go there. I may be 100% wrong. As I said, to the extent I have any skill at all, it's generally in being able to predict the value of stocks of companies (and other assets) many years from now, and in biopharma, if anywhere. 
  
I hope everyone does well, and even is being entertained, by all of this. Just make sure that if you have a massive gain in GME, that you 'take something off the table'. Don't be greedy. Some of this money is life-changing. Even if it is 10% of your position, book some kind of gain. It will feel good. Be objective. Don't use margin--you may lose more than you can afford. I've been there. It sucks balls worse than you can imagine. Don't do it for GME, even if RH or anyone else lets you. Don't go too crazy with options, even if they let you. I hope you all are able to buy Wu-Tang albums, tendies, autism treatment and whatever else your hearts desire at the 'end' of this, whatever that means. 
  Good luck WSB, I love you!

Be on guard for them to try to flash crash GME at 3:59.

I recently read, that RH was restricting sales to 1 share and the UK broker turning off buys.  This seems to a tactic to silo off buys.

RH will likely turn off all buys soon.

I'm concerned that they may plan to flash crash it at 3:59pm.  If you've considered buying in, consider buying /setting a limit order at **3:45pm EST**

So if you don't have a RH account, put in a limit order at 3:59pm to buy 1 or more share at a price you're comfortable with, if you want.  This will provide a huge bid wall in front of the them, in case the pummel the order flow with low asks.

**Edit:  From Note1, I would argue that it would be better to set a limit order around 3:45pm in case they try to do a halt. see Note.**

**If this was informative. Tell 2 friends and tell them to tell 2 friends. pass it on.**

Note:

""Just wanted to add to your post that **like yesterday they may try the flash crash 5 min before end. The volatility halt will kick in, (as it did yesterday at 15:59:41), so we had no chance of getting it up in those last 19 seconds.** If they are hovering 10%+ above 115, 150, 200 with ten min to go, we know that will be their plan - **and 15:50-15:54 will be crucial to get out of the 10% trap""**

Be on guard for them to try to flash crash GME at 3:59.

I recently read, that RH was restricting sales to 1 share and the UK broker turning off buys. This seems to a tactic to silo off buys.

RH will likely turn off all buys soon.

I'm concerned that they may plan to flash crash it at 3:59pm. If you've considered buying in, consider buying /setting a limit order at **3:45pm EST**

So if you don't have a RH account, put in a limit order at 3:45pm to buy 1 or more share at a price you're comfortable with, if you want. This will provide a huge bid wall in front of the them, in case the pummel the order flow with low asks.

**Edit: From Note1, I would argue that it would be better to set a limit order around 3:45pm in case they try to do a halt. see Note.**

**If this was informative. Tell 2 friends and tell them to tell 2 friends. pass it on.**

Note:

""Just wanted to add to your post that **like yesterday they may try the flash crash 5 min before end. The volatility halt will kick in, (as it did yesterday at 15:59:41), so we had no chance of getting it up in those last 19 seconds.** If they are hovering 10%+ above 115, 150, 200 with ten min to go, we know that will be their plan - **and 15:50-15:54 will be crucial to get out of the 10% trap""**

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here‚Äôs a trick that will work.

1) Go to Feb 5 option.
2) Scroll all the way down the call list
3) Buy GME call option with the cheapest +x.xx%
4) Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let‚Äôs get them!!!

P.S. If you can afford 100 shares but can‚Äôt afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.

_This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY. You can lose 100% of anything you invest._

EDIT:

1) This works for pretty much any stock.

2) There‚Äôs a catch. You need enough money (please don‚Äôt use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.

Example:

- $GME is $300
- The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000
- Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000).
- Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)

You could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185640.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'P', 'S', 'NOT', 'ONLY', '$GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

For some reason the media has been presenting this like we are 'targeting' wall street on some sort of holier than thou crusade reversal of fortune thing. Guess what. We aren't. We would also be more than happy to take jobs at any fund you can name. We just like the stock. Our goals around here include buying blow and hookers. Maybe the occasional boat or private jet. Think the wolf of wall street, those are our aspirations.

**If retail had shorted 220% of GME's float we would be squeezing them just as hard**

Sure, its funny to take down some stuck up fund managers, but thats a side bonus. We make fun of Citron because Andrew Left got his wife stolen by a green energy billionaire, we make fun of Melvin cuz they tried to short a meme stock.

We have shorted plenty of stocks. Nobody cares. Last year we all made a killing riding the markets down while the normies lost their jobs and lived off stimmy checks. We ride the trends in whichever direction they point. The markets are a zero sum game. Welcome to the club.

But anyways, we owe you a thank you I suppose. Without you getting super jazzed for the 'revolution' we would have never had the capital to squeeze like we did. You may hate millionaires but you certainly made a ton of new ones this week.

How to Buy GME etc \[Loophole\]

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here‚Äôs a trick that will work.

1. Go to Feb 5 option.
2. Scroll all the way down the call list
3. Buy GME call option with the cheapest +x.xx%
4. Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let‚Äôs get them!!! TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE!!!! HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD

&#x200B;

GME has only about 65 million shares available in the market (free-float), that means, you can trade an unlimited amount with derivatives like CFDs, but there's a real scarcity on the main asset, in this case the stock.

&#x200B;

We are about 6 million users here, this means that, if each user buys 10 stocks of GME, more than the 85% of the free float shares are going to be assigned, and in this case, it's going to create a problem for closing short-selling positions, since the users are going to be determining the final price to buy again the stock in order to close the trade. (Remember, scarcity is the word here.)

&#x200B;

Don't you know what this means? I'm not telling to hoard the market and manipulate the order-book, but do the mental math. WALL STREET BETS WON, we are going to be the ones deciding when this craze is going to end, and this is a victory for retail traders, if we want, we could sweep the market.

&#x200B;

Remember that Goerge Soros did something similar to the GBP, if you pressure enough the market you are going to find out where it lacks liquidity.

I've commented before about what trash this company is, and what trash their fucking app. is.

This is the equivalent of telling you that now you're only allowed to sell, not buy, because Citadel got on the wrong side of these trades when you made them.

Robinhood does not send your trades to the exchange.  They send them directly to Citadel or one of three or four other market makers.  You're betting directly against Robinhood when you use it.  They clear their own trades.

It's a total sham, and they are exactly the antithesis of what they bill themselves as.  They are designed for these big money players to make money, and for you to lose.

Get a fucking Fidelity account.  They send your trade to the exchange, and pay for that.  They don't get paid for order flow.  They're not on the other side of your trade, so they have *no incentive* to tell you that you can't buy something, *because they need you to sell it to them, instead*."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185646.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|[]|[]

If you note, there were insane volumes during closing, but price remained steady. Because when the hedgecunts where manipulating it to go down and crash, several people found out the technique to buy excercisable calls with almost no premium.

We bypassed the ban on buying more shares and were able to keep the momentum going above 320.

We won the battle, and are well on our way to win the war. Since it closed above 320, millions of calls will be exercised and the gamma squeeze has officially begun. All we have to do now is HOLD. Just chill during this weekend for we have a war to win next week.

I don't know if the technique will work on Monday, and if it does, anyone looking to buy 100 shares or more can do it. Remember to remove stop losses, and set limit higher than 1,000$

As a result of this and the fact that this is the only one  that is suing more than just Robinhood (it's also going after all the  major trading platforms, Apex and Citadel), it's highly likely that this  particular one is the one all the other class actions are going to get  rolled into, even though the New York one was filed first.  It's also  the only one of the 5 led by a firm that specializes in class action.

I've  been in contact with the lead in this case (I'm backing it, in fact), and the firm is looking for  all other people who have demonstrable losses and damages as a result  of RH, TDA, Schwab et al's actions as they compile their opening salvo.

The  firm representing the action in the 10th Circuit is the Hannon Law  Firm, and the case is being speared by founder Kevin Hannon.

l85fnq|725.0|A breakdown of how the short squeeze started and what‚Äôs going on with brokerages.|t3_l85fnq|0.97|1711|1711|hot|2021-01-30 00:55:05.000000|itsmrlowetoyou|412|Discussion|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l85fnq/a_breakdown_of_how_the_short_squeeze_started_and/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l85fnq/a_breakdown_of_how_the_short_squeeze_started_and/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l85fnq/a_breakdown_of_how_the_short_squeeze_started_and/|"GameStop short float is currently around 250%. 

For a second, let‚Äôs just imagine there are only 100 shares total of GameStop.

This means that person A owns 100 shares. Person B is a short seller and borrows them, sells them to person C who buys them. At this point the stock is 100% short.

Person C then lends those shares to Person D who is a short seller who then sells them to person E who buys them.  The stock is now 200% short. 

Person E lends 50 of them to person F who is a short seller who sells them to person G who buys 50. The stock is now 250% short

So now person A, C, and E all own the same 100. The brokerage sights are limiting buying because they are attempting to unwind that! If everybody right now demanded their shares. The brokerage sites should be on the hook for $34.5 Bil worth of stock that doesn‚Äôt exist.

That‚Äôs fucked up but here‚Äôs where it gets crazy. 

There were never any controls on monitoring if somebody‚Äôs shares had been sold short twice. 

When a short seller sells shares. They are immediately paid. So cash is in their accounts. 
When a person buys shares they pay money out and theoretically own shares. But because the short selling wasn‚Äôt tracked brokers do not possess the shares they were putting into the market. If everyone were to request their shares they would default on their obligations and fold. Meaning they only have 100 shares and person A, C, and E all have a claim to those shares. Meaning the buyers are left fighting over who has shares. And the short sellers are left holding the cash they collected. 

It gets super messy. 

If Robinhood were to default. Short sellers win. Then most likely the fed has to come in and save the buyers spending tax dollars. That‚Äôs why the fed is getting involved.

By limiting shares and removing the ability to continue to short, they are trying to unwind this mess without it causing a panick.

That is why the broader market is down. 

Not because of shorts covering... but because of the potential for brokerages to collapse. 

I‚Äôm guessing Robinhood, TD, IB, and E-Trade are on the hook for a vast majority of the shares that don‚Äôt actually exist but multiple people own.

Imagine if person A says he doesn‚Äôt want to lend his shares.  The broker and clearing house has to figure out how to balance person B-G sourcing shares from somewhere else.

If the brokerages don‚Äôt go under. Short sellers, the hedge funds, are on the hook. 

If they do go under... economic recession. 

Retail investors once again left holding the bag.

Institutions don‚Äôt use these little guys. They use IB to trade and then they have the physical shares transferred into accounts at 5/3rd. If IB were to go under their fund would be fine. But most brokerage accounts are only insured up to up to $250k.

This is a failure of the system as a whole. This is a problem created by the top .001% and they are trying to call it a Reddit rebellion. Fuck that. 

This is totally a short selling fault. I think the outcome of this is that short selling gets banned.

Edit: Changed we to they, our to their. I‚Äôm not a hedge fund manager I‚Äôm a retail retard like the rest of you who just wanted to spread some information.

&#x200B;

\# Don't want to read?

&#x200B;

\- \[[https://youtu.be/knrlijBR4MQ](https://youtu.be/knrlijBR4MQ)\]([https://youtu.be/knrlijBR4MQ](https://youtu.be/knrlijBR4MQ))

\- This is the 17 minute long YouTube video along with interview with Webull CEO Anthony Denier who provided supporting evidence to everything I claimed.

&#x200B;

üíé üôå üíé üôå üíé üôå üíé üôå üíé üôå üíé üôå

&#x200B;

\> TL;DR ‚Üí Melvin Capital fucked up so bad that they were about to destroy the entire market through counter party risk leading to a massive liquidity crisis. Since Melvin and other hedge funds were too big to fail, to prevent a complete market collapse, DTC had to screw the clearing firms (who then had to screw brokers who then had to screw retail) by raising settlement collateral from 3% to 100%. This led to a tricke down effect which shutdown $GME trading (and a few others) and then drove prices low enough that Melvin Capital wouldn't collapse and take the entire securities market with it.

&#x200B;

Basically, Melvin Capital over-leveraged and was about to destroy the entire market. DTC couldn't let that happen. Thus, DTC forced retail traders to bail out Melvin Capital through a series of trickle down events that started with                                                                     DTC raising settlement collateral on $GME from 3% to 100%.

&#x200B;

In short, Melvin fucked up big so DTC forced you to bail them out.

&#x200B;

\# 1. Background Information

&#x200B;

\### How trading works behind the scenes

&#x200B;

1. DTC (Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation)

\- Monopoly that helps settle funds from trading

\- Traditionally funds take two days to settle

\- Purpose ‚Üí Provide liquidity in the meantime

\- Makes sure sellers get their money when they sell

\- BUT usually requires 1-3% collateral just in case

2. Clearing Firms (APEX Clearing)

\- Intermediatery between DTCC and Brokers to clear trades

\- Pays collateral to DTCC until trade settles

3. Brokers (Robinhood, WeBull)

\- Facilitate securities exchange between traders

4. Traders

&#x200B;

\# 2. Why Was $GME Trading Halted?

&#x200B;

\### DTC without warning raised collateral from 3% to 100%

&#x200B;

\### What stocks were affected?

&#x200B;

\- $GME, $AMC, $KOSS

&#x200B;

\### What is the impact?

&#x200B;

\- Clearing Firms now have to hand over \*\*100% cash collateral\*\* to DTC for \*\*every single trade\*\*

\- AND hundreds billions of dollars are traded constantly, how can Clearing Firms handle 100%?

\- ANSWER: Clearing firms obviously CANNOT provide the required collateral

\- RESULT: Clearing firms called up the brokerages and told them to shutdown trading

\- Ex. Robinhood shutdown all selling of $GME and other volatile securities

\- Did DTC know this was going to happen? Hell yeah. They did it on purpose.

&#x200B;

\# 3. Why DTC Suddenly Required 100% Collateral

&#x200B;

\### The entire securities market was about to collapse.

You heard that right.

&#x200B;

\### What how?

&#x200B;

\- If $GME prices kept going up, Melvin Capital would be unable to pay and cover their shorts

\- Then it would trickle down to the Clearing Firms who would be on the hook

\- But we are talking about BILLIONS of dollars here

\- So Clearing Firms would be in the water and not have enough

\- Meaning, if you sell a share, you won't receive a penny because NO ONE CAN PAY

\- Result ‚Üí Counter party risk ‚Üí Complete market breakdown

&#x200B;

\### It gets worse...

&#x200B;

\- Clearing Firms being underwater would cause a domino effect to the ENTIRE MARKET

\- Remember, Clearing Firms help clear pretty much every security traded

\- So if Clearing Firms goes under due to $GME...

\- Then not a single security on the marketplace could be cleared

\- \*\*The entire market would collapse\*\*

&#x200B;

\### Case Study: 2008 Financial Crisis

&#x200B;

\- Remember Lehman Brothers? They were also a clearing firm.

\- Lehman was the clearing firm for many other hedge funds

\- When Lehman collapsed, the hedge funds it supported \*\*also became counter party risk\*\*

\- Result?

\- \*\*Complete market breakdown\*\*

\- Which is why the U.S. Government had to come and \*\*bail them out\*\*

&#x200B;

\# 4. Who's Responsible / Who to Blame

&#x200B;

\### So fuck DTC right? Not really.

&#x200B;

\- You have to understand...

\- \*\*DTC only had two choices\*\*

1. Leave everything as it is and let the market collapse

2. Screw the $GME holders to protect the rest of the market

\- Can't really blame them...

&#x200B;

\### Then who do we blame?

&#x200B;

\- \*\*MELVIN CAPITAL and other hedge fund shorts\*\*

\- Their greed almost collapsed the U.S. securities exchange market (potentially global as well) because they over-leveraged and shorted 140% of $GME float.

\- They made a horrible call trying to profit off of a struggling business with insane leverage.

&#x200B;

\### But who does Wall Street blame?

&#x200B;

\- \*\*Wall Street blames Retail Traders and r/WallStreetBets\*\*

\- Their reasoning ‚Üí If everyday folks didn't discover our evil and irresponsible strategies, this never wouldn't have happened."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185649.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['CEO', 'I', 'DR', 'DTC', '$GME', 'DTC', 'DTC', 'DTC', '$GME', 'DTC', 'DTC', 'BUT', 'APEX', 'DTCC', 'DTCC', '$GME', 'DTC', '$GME', '$AMC', '$KOSS', 'DTC', 'AND', 'ANNOT', '$GME', 'DTC', 'DTC', '$GME', 'LIONS', 'NO', 'ONE', 'CAN', 'PAY', 'NTIRE', 'ARKET', '$GME', 'U', 'S', 'DTC', 'DTC', '$GME', 'ELVIN', 'PITAL', 'U', 'S', '$GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'KOSS', 'GME', 'GME', 'PAY', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

For those new to the subreddit, you'll notice that we use [some ""colorful"" language](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7fr21/basic_guide_to_wallstreetbets_culture_for). Rest assured, we mean you no harm. It might take a while to get used to how we talk, but you'll quickly find that this subreddit is surprisingly kind.

#**And we've got you!**

The community here is incredible. Each and every one of you make this place great and better than it was the day before. 

For those who have been around for a while, please reach out and help the newcomers. For those who are new, please don't hesitate to ask questions and get involved. 

From the bottom of my heart, thank you for being here.

Why do you keep doubling down on your short positions? Why are new hedge funds are coming in and scooping up new short positions? What the fuck are you shitstains on society doing? What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you understand who we are?

We don‚Äôt fucking play here. We lose money for fucking breakfast. Every day. And then we come back and lose even more fucking money. We buy out of the money weeklies on fucking THURSDAYS.

Your plan was really just to put us in a position where all we have to do is hold SHARES? Say less fam. I haven‚Äôt owned a share in four years. I sold AAPL AMD and ENPH calls last week just to buy shares of GameStop and fuck you up as much as possible so we can make memes about it.

Double down, triple down, quadruple down, take every penny of your rich boomer clients money and put it on the table. Sink the entire already artificially propped up economy over it. We know you will. And because we know you will, we are going to make you do it. Just like the coyote blindly chasing the roadrunner off of a fucking cliff. Chop off your whole head to spite your face.

Learn these 3 lessons as fast as possible, I‚Äôm not saying they will save you money, but they might save you from being blindsided by reality.  

1. WallStreetBets does not care about you. You are nobody. Occasionally a person accomplishes enough to be recognizable, but it‚Äôs such a small fraction it‚Äôs negligible. You are completely and utterly alone in this game. The times that this subreddit has served as a haven for confirmation bias in times of uncertainty are the times that the most people have walked away with horrible losses. 

2. Nobody is a prophet. Nobody here is powerful enough to make plays with 100% certainty. The majority of prophets and astrologists here have ended up major losers and hated by the community. 

3. Only putting in what you can afford to lose is a fairy tale, the only ‚Äòunrealized losses‚Äô are the losses you haven‚Äôt realized you‚Äôre not getting back yet, and there‚Äôs no such thing as only playing with house money. Any ‚Äúunrealized‚Äù gains are YOUR dollars, not the house‚Äôs anymore. And you could spend years convincing yourself you could afford to lose what you lost. That‚Äôs if you don‚Äôt pick up an addiction on the way and lose more.

**Why I‚Äôve Done It**: My daughter is autistic. She is the light of my life.

**How to make it even better**: Share on twitter, maybe @ papa musk to see if they‚Äôll match donations. Make this a trend, *make a difference*. Keep this going, repost and make sure all see it.

I see a lot of people shitting on AMC for being framed a ""scape-goat"" for GME shorts to divert us from GME.

There is no doubt that short squeeze is apparent in GME but let me explain why AMC shorts can also get FUCKED by recent events.

&#x200B;

# 1. AMC Has a High Short Interest % [https://www.highshortinterest.com/](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)

AMC is #2 on the list with a whopping 78.97% of float being shorted. and looking at the % held by institutions( 37.24% ) and assuming that these institutions are long on the stock, we're looking a short to float percentage of about **116.21%.**

Yes it's still lower than GME's 200 something % but 116% is still very, VERY high.

If this is not enough to cause a short squeeze I don't know what will.

# 2. AMC Got 2 Big Unexpected News.

Just like how Ryan Cohen's involvement has started this crazy investing phenomena, AMC has also receive a bunch of unexpected news that caught the ears of boomer investors.

Recently it has received a lot of funding to not go bankrupt and even wiped off their debt by diluting shares. This was a great move as many investors will be looking forward to hop in for brighter prospect of the company. Plus with the vaccines being released AMC will get back on their feet in no time. Also, since they recently raised money by diluting shares and wiping away their debt, there won't be more share dilution in the near future.

Lastly, with the whole GME scandal, it received soooo much coverage on media and the public  which is only going to hurt the shorts.

# 3. New Shorts are In The House

If you look at [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/amc](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/amc) and [https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc](https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc) The shares available to short has gone down significantly. JUST 4 days ago the short availability was at **7 million** and now this morning it went all the way down to **500**(0 on fintel).

This means a lot of shorts possibly jumped in due to the recent jump in the stock price. However, what they don't realize is that this is an unprecedented time where millions of retailers are buying the stock to HOLD...because they like the stock. Not to bring down corrupt hedge fund fuckers of course.

# 4. GME Steam Has Cooled Off a Bit

I know I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this last point but, personally, I think GME has potentially gone up to a point where retailers are not hopping in as much because of the high stock price but the ones who already got in are holding/adding to force the shorts to cover. This could explain why it really hasn't moved all that much in the past 2 days(except when it went down to like $132) despite people saying there will be a gamma squeeze today.

AMC is sitting at $13.00 as of now and it is at a relatively more ""desirable"" price for normal people to hop in. Psychologically it FEELS better to hold 30 stocks than 1 stock.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm not suggesting you should sell GME and buy AMC but I can see about 5x return on AMC and about 3x return on GME in the near future. and I like to make more money so my money goes to AMC. I can write about how I got those 3x and 5x but that's for next time.

Consider avoiding firms that use Apex Clearing Corp.|t3_l87rwj|0.99|281|281|top|2021-01-30 02:29:48.000000|DutchBookOptions|137|Discussion|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87rwj/psa_moving_from_robinhood_consider_avoiding_firms/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87rwj/psa_moving_from_robinhood_consider_avoiding_firms/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87rwj/psa_moving_from_robinhood_consider_avoiding_firms/|"Brokerages must use a custodian to clear all trades. Many brokerages use Apex Clearing Corp., which informed their clients this week that trades in GME and AMC (among others) would be restricted to closing-only. Brokerages that use Apex were forced to restrict their clients to closing-only, and had no voice in the matter. (Robinhood, TDAmeritrade, and Interactive Brokers do not use Apex Clearing and were dicks just because they're dicks).

&#x200B;

Firms that use Apex Clearing Corp., and therefore were forced to restrict the purchase of securities this week (and therefore may be forced to do so again in the future) include:

* WeBull
* SoFi
* Tasty Works
* Ally Invest
* M1 Finance
* Betterment
* Firstrade

&#x200B;

Some brokerages have their own clearing companies in-house, including Fidelity and ETrade. By the way, Robinhood makes all of its money by selling its order feed to Companies like Citadel (mainly Citadel). Fidelity is one of the  few brokerages out there which doesn't sell its orders to anyone, ever.

Tasty Works has worked well for me, but since they use Apex, they were forced to restrict the purchase of GME this week and I decided to move to a new brokerage. I created an account with both Fidelity and ETrade to give both of them a shot and this was my experience:

Fidelity:

 \- I filled out the application, but half way through the process I got a server timeout error (presumably because of lots of people doing the same thing as me). I tried again and it worked fine. I also had a question so I called their customer service number. I was on hold for about 3 minutes, then spoke with a real person who was nice and answered my question.

ETrade:

 \- I filled out an application, then got a screen saying that my account creation could not be completed until I called and spoke with a customer service representative. Ok. I called the number on the screen, and waited on hold for 43 minutes (at 8am). I called back later and waited on hold for about an hour and 15 minutes before giving up.

&#x200B;

Extra tidbit regarding Apex:

I tried to submit a Wiki entry for Apex Clearing Corp. last year, but was rejected 3 times because I couldn't provide any acceptable sources. Why couldn't I provide sources for the info? Because you won't find shit about them online which wikipedia considers to be a reliable source, other than on their own site (which was why I was trying to create the wiki page in the first place)."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185710.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'AMC', 'GME']

Clearly it won't have 13 million for long, so we are going to have 5-10 million people flocking to other brokerages.


Someone way smarter than me, feel free to offer your insight, but it seems to me like the brokeragws that get flocked to are going to have the same ""concerns"" Robin Hood had about protecting the little guy and preventing volatility (which is all just lies for actually wanting to protect big money market makers) and start doling out restrictions the same way Robin Hood is.


Cuz I mean that amount of people influx is going to have an effect on these firms risk management... I feel like they are going to slowly make restrictions on retail investing industry-wide.


Anyone with some thoughts to make me feel better?


Seriously, tell me I'm crazy and that it's never going to happen like this, and tell me why






Edit: seriously, somebody make a long, well thought-out response as to why I'm crazy and this is never going to happen.

cuz I absolutely do not want it to happen but it really seems like that's where we're headed and it's terrifying


I mean look at this fucking list

https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/


There's over FIFTY stocks on here!!!!!! And fucking Boomer ones to like not just random obscure Reddit meme stocks.


Go run through that whole thing yourself guys oh, we are being locked out of literally anything that has a catalyst of any kind or anything that has above average trading volume.


It's really fucking terrifying there are big ass fucking names on there... Like why the fuck does GM need to be restricted? Sbux? 



Again, someone please come in here and tell me ""it's just Robinhood, and no other brokerage would ever do this so massively in any event ever, and here is why""


That is what I'm looking for


I know that other brokerages have in some cases been putting restrictions on buying, but it's genuinely been limited to like five or six pure Reddit stocks


But if all of the Robinhood users leave and go to other brokerages, is there a logical cogent argument as to why those other brokerages would never restrict THIS many stocks? And I mean totally unrelated ones....... This is literally retail investors just being blocked from investing there's no other way to put that it's not just fucking troll shit there are again, fucking big ass names on that list

Second edit: I mean that amount of users, 13 mil, even if it's split up into three or four different ways between three or four different brokerages that is going to add a massive amount of risk calculation to every brokerage that just gets fucking in fluxed with straight up millions of people at one time.... You want to talk about volatility?.... I mean again, is there a reason that no one is straight up expecting shit to go fucked up like this?

For this reason I had pre-emptively placed some limit sell orders.

I placed these at levels of someone who LIKES THIS STOCK would make, these were made in Canada on Wealth Simple.  These were approved and moved to my pending orders, these remained all day.  When the market closed and I arrived home, I cancelled to re asses my plan of attack for Monday.

To my dismay I was given an error, Wealth Simple would not let me place new limit sell orders in the similar ranges.

I immediately reached out to their customer service via email, a pop up alerted me it would be 24 hours to hear back, I heard back within an hour.  Here is a clip of what a polite customer service rep gave responded with:

'There is a maximum on how far you can set your limit price as the US executing brokerages will reject any orders too far away from the real price of the US stock or ETF.

Limit orders will be required to have a limit price within 30% of the delayed quoted price to reduce the risk of the orders being rejected by executing brokers.'

SO Wealth Simple - in this time of massive swings, wants us to set limit orders at 30% on their 15 minute lagged price!  Pretty much ensuring I DO not get what I aim to, not only that.. but they currently have a warning about using the MARKET SELL feature for this specific ticker.. however when a stock is moving up so quick, how can you set a limit price of 30%?!

Terrible time to do this, not only that, when I reached out further, they gave me a 'Due to COVID we may not respond for up to 3 days... I bet they are being inundated with frustrated traders..

Good luck trading with a 15 minute lag.. this makes things more difficult (Delayed Quote Price)

Needed to expose this, hoping they will revert or improve the percentage or the limit sell feature is useless in the play I had anticipated.

\-If mods need to see screenshots or emails I have everything, also please weigh in if this is happening to you!  Brokerages playing dirty should be exposed in this time.

&#x200B;

EDIT: THIS IS GME OBVIOUSLY TO THE FUCKING MOON.

&#x200B;

EDIT AGAIN: If you value your users, do not pull this shit in times like these!

I will be transferring OUT OF Wealth Simple and will express my feelings on a REVIEW.  I would encourage anyone who has been similarly effected to do the same (after you sell GME), as it may make the difference. 

 IT'S NOT TOO LATE - CHANGE BACK THIS WEEKEND AND I WILL FORGIVE YOU!

# Transferring from RH to Fidelity

This process is actually very simple.

1. Log on to your Fidelity trading account on a browser.
2. In a different tab, log on to your RH account. Go to your info, and copy your RHS account number. Focus back on the Fidelity tab after copying this number.
3. In the top right of the Fidelity home page, type ""transfer asset"". Click on the link, and you should be in the Transfer of Assets (TOA) page.
4. Click on ""Start a transfer""
5. In the ""Select your current firm"" field, type ""Robinhood"". It should show up as ""Robinhood Securities Llc."". Select that to go to the next step.

7. In the next screen, you can select a specific equity or the whole account.
8. Wait 2-3 days for your RH account to show nothing, and a day or two after that for everything to pop up on Fidelity.
9. Now, you may shut down the RH account. Make sure you download ALL transactions before you close out the account. Who knows whether RH will even exist by the time it's the next tax filing season.

According to several sources its around 100%. Yahoo finance has it at 122%. Finviz has it at 95%. And Nasdaq has it at 110%.

([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME))

([https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME))

([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings))

Now I know what your smooth brain is telling you. ""How can it be over 100%?"". Well it can be for two main reasons. The first is differences in when companies report their holdings to the SEC, not everyone reports on the same day. The other reason is due to short selling. If institution A has their shares shorted to institution B, then both technically own stock in the company but its being counted twice when reported to the SEC. 

The other question on everyone's mind is, ""How much of the float is still short?"". According S3 Partners market data, after the close today we're still at 113%!!!

([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20))

So how does this all unfold? We've got an army of retards who won't sell for less than $69,420.00, what seems like almost 100% of the float owned by big institutions that can't sell their position all at once  (it's possible they've started selling some of their shares), and still over 100% of the float is short. I really have no idea but it seems like at this point no one who owns a share should have to sell at a loss.

**TL;DR: over 100% of GME float is held by institutions or retards who aren't gonna sell and there is still over 100% of the float being shorted. Flow just handed us the fucking Name Your Price Tool**

When my kids want a game, or for me, we go on https://www.gamestop.com web, find where the game is available and go get it. There aren't any in the dead boomer malls close by, Game Stops are all in anchor strip malls. They are where your local grocery store is. In and out of the store in a few minutes unless we browse. There are no hard pressure sales, but you guys know that. We also now own the game and they can take it to their mom's, grandparent's, where ever without moving the console. I easily spend $600 a year there.



Point is, I'll be utilizing this business model as long as it's available and I'm sure there are many other GenX parents that will do as well.

**TL;DR**

&gt;They could potentially to short attack to lower the prices enough that brokers margin call the owners of ITM calls on Monday. You can short the float for 100 shares, essentially making yourself delta neutral to protect yourself, then you get rid of them both on open with full gains.



Price is down $20 AH so be prepared for the morning dip. More scare tactics.

So, if institutional investors want to punish the retail investors they need to do it in a way that the retail investors have trouble countering.

In most cases, they would try to get the strike to where a majority of the open options positions would expire just under the strike with the most interest to keep people from having them executed and making money (in this case, the target would be &lt;$320)

But my theory is, since there is a huge short interest, it's better for the big players to let GME finish above 320 which causes the largest open interest (300, 320) to all get auto-exercised.

Most retail traders don't know how to prevent the auto-exercise, so this causes a bunch of people to buy the stock at 300 and 320 (and various other strikes, under the 325 closing price)

Then they short the price down hard and buy to cover at the lower price in after-hours market, which has much less exposure to the retail investors. Right now the price is down to ~300.

This allows them to gain a profit of ~$20 right now on the execution of those 320s and potentially more, if the price continues to drop.

If the price actually tanks well below 300, this will additionally trigger margin calls Monday morning on the people assigned the shares at 320 and generate maximum profit for the short sellers.

It's too early to determine if this will happen since it would require a hell of a sell-off, but there is clearly an absolute ton of pressure to lower the price after hours to punish those who were holding 300 and 320 calls.

To give a more concrete example of how to manipulate the price:

HF buys GME when it dipped under $150.

HF sells GME 320 calls after it goes back up, for $$$$

Market pins GME at 325 at expiry, forcing auto assignment of 320s

Instead of allowing the cheap GME to be called away, they force the price down after hours.

They buy shares to cover their short calls at a discount, since they will get $320 for them.

Price was bouncing pretty hard between 300-320, but creeping back over 320 now. Should be quite interesting to see if it holds.

**Reasons you might want to disable your share lending settings include:**

1. You don't want to lend your shares to people trying to short your stocks
2. You think the person/entity loaning your stock may not return them
3. You're not being compensated well enough for putting your securities at risk

These programs are complex and highly variable depending on your broker. Without getting into all the details now just now, you should be aware of the most common types of lending:

* Brokers reserve the right to lend out securities bought on margin (in other words, with borrowed money from your broker). **To avoid this type of lending, don't buy stocks on margin.** As far as I know, this is the case for all brokers that offer margin accounts. (However if you have explicit confirmation to the contrary from your broker, feel free to provide it here!)
* Most brokers can ALSO lend out your fully-owned shares. Brokers will do one of the following:

1. Lend out **fully-owned** shares purely based on the **type of account** you have (e.g., Margin account type). The only solution in this case is switching account types. Example: Degiro
2. Lend out **fully-owned** shares **regardless of account type** (even Cash accounts).
   1. Some brokers **allow you to opt-out**. Example: Webull
   2. Some brokers **do not allow you to opt-out**. Your only recourse to avoid lending is switching brokers. Example: M1 finance

I have been in the fucking game for about seven years now. 

I don‚Äôt typically do posts like this and so this is fucking new to me. Anyways, it seems like a shit ton of you are falling out of favor with NOK. I don‚Äôt know what the fuck is wrong with you if you expected to gain a shit ton of money in a day, but what the fuck I have never seen such üßªü§≤üèª in my fucking life for the past two days. 

Are you guys really just going to stand there and let the enemy beat the fuck out of us. 

And of course some of you are going to mention the total float as if that fucking matters because the stock is still cheap as fuck (for now lol üöÄ) and because we managed to trade one fucking fifth of all the NOK stocks in circulation. They literally had to stop our asses from buying a couple of times. Just like you autistic retards I have lost thousands of dollars in this shit. My paychecks, birthday money, dividends, money from the sale of blue chips and Ark ETFs, etc.

So where‚Äôs the upside? Well let me fucking tell you where the upside is and when you can expect to pull off the biggest fucking heist alongside GME and AMC Wall Street will have ever seen. üî•üöÄüí∏

NOK is well known to be the bigger beast when it comes to the BANG stocks (BB, AMC, NOK, GME). It has a fuck load of shares to go around and there‚Äôs a lot of paperhanded pussies out there, so I understand why it may be daunting to expect a Juggernaut like NOK to moon anytime soon. 

But it doesn‚Äôt have to be. 

NOK releases its earnings on Thursday and its expected to blow the competition out of the fucking water. I wouldn‚Äôt even be surprised at all if it were to get a higher price than ERIC in two weeks (hell, possibly by EOW). NOK even plans to merge with top tier companies in the near future due to their prowess in the 5G tech that they‚Äôre developing. The üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêª have had their big meaty claws ever since its ATH of $62 all those years ago. Do you really expect a change if you don‚Äôt fucking BUY and fucking HOLD. No, with a team of fucking retarded  superstars in this sub, NOK is prepping for a fierce comeback in the upcoming weeks. GME is top dog right now, but let‚Äôs be honest. GME hype can‚Äôt last forever (even tho it can for a long time as long as we remain retarded). However being on team NOK makes me feel like I‚Äôm on a loosing, shitty ass baseball team and no one is hitting over .100

What‚Äôs the plan, Stan?

The fucking plan is that you don‚Äôt buy market price. You look at the ask price and you fucking buy it. This is how we destroy walls. The $5 barrier battle today was hard fought and we fucking lost to the hedge funds. This next week is going to be fucking spectacular ü™ÑüöÄü§≤üèªüíé and I need to know if my fucking NOKle heads are even in it to win it or just downright frauds. 

You say NOK was a plan by the bots? Take a look at fucking BlackBerry. That shit took the same swerves NOK did that it‚Äôs pretty much identical. If NOK is a sham, then the idea of the BANG stocks is a sham. 

I know for a fucking fact you don‚Äôt believe that. I know that there‚Äôs dreamers in this sub. I dream just like you. I am trying to build a life just like you guys are. We are in something way bigger than ourselves so if you can for ONCE IN YOUR LIFE consider that maybe that the process is a trustable process then maybe we can win this shit.

If NOK hits $50, I will literally buy new fucking silverware (like expensive handmade shit with sterling silver cutlery) and eat my own shit. I don‚Äôt give a fuck whether you‚Äôd want to see it or not, because honestly boys I‚Äôd eat my shit to go to the moon and I am 200% willing to take one for the team. 

This year, BANG is for real.

So hedgefunds, keep your ears out for the NOK NOK sounds on the door. We‚Äôre pissed and we‚Äôre armed to the teeth.

EDIT: General cheese reporting. Post this shit everywhere. I dont give a fuck. I WILL be producing a flank strategy tomorrow. People have to know goddamn it. Monday/Tuesday will close at $7 just give it time

The bell doesn‚Äôt fucking ring until WSB says it fucking rings. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄü•µü•µ

EDIT 2: some of you pussies are asking where you can buy NOK. The easiest way to buy it is with that fucking app all the whores on Tinder beg for food money on: Cashapp. There are literally no fucking limits and if you want an extra 2 fucking shares then use this shit when you sign the fuck up and get $10 extra buckaroos: BKXDNGQ. I also want to make it clear that everyone should share their cash apps so that we can get that $10 extra to put into NOK. I‚Äôm only doing this for the small wagecucks so if you have the money to do so, then don‚Äôt bother. This is just the only thing on the top of my head that would help out in any way"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185643.csv|StockTicker|['NOK', 'HEADS', 'GET', 'THE', 'HELL', 'IN', 'HERE', 'WE', 'NEED', 'TO', 'TALK']|['NOK']|['I', 'I', 'I', 'NOK', 'I', 'I', 'NOK', 'I', 'GME', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'BANG', 'BB', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'I', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'I', 'ERIC', 'NOK', 'G', 'ATH', 'BUY', 'HOLD', 'NOK', 'GME', 'GME', 'NOK', 'I', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'BANG', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'ONCE', 'IN', 'YOUR', 'LIFE', 'NOK', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'BANG', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'I', 'I', 'WILL', 'WSB', 'EDIT', 'NOK', 'XDNGQ', 'I', 'NOK']|['NOK', 'NOK', 'GME', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'ERIC', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'GME', 'GME', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK']

You‚Äôve always had an inflated ego, and going to Wharton for an MBA definitely didn‚Äôt help in that regard. You interned at GS for the summer of 2003 and told all your friends about it, probably even brought it up oh so casually on dates. When you were hired as a trader by a moderately good to great fund, you probably lost a good deal of friends from your previous life, because they ‚Äújust don‚Äôt get you now.‚Äù You‚Äôre in a different league than them, even your classmates that now work at lesser funds. You act friendly, liking Facebook posts, returning their calls, but there‚Äôs a nagging feeling that they‚Äôre holding you back. That you‚Äôve *made it*, and you don‚Äôt need some loser that doesn‚Äôt even work on the East Coast.

**Jump ahead a few years**

It‚Äôs September 20th, 2008. Bear Stearns closed months earlier, Lehman went bankrupt a few days ago. ""Buddies"" of yours from both funds have been texting you, some you know from college. Maybe you‚Äôll take pity on them and put in a good word, maybe you‚Äôll tell them nothing‚Äôs available right now and that you‚Äôre sorry. You don‚Äôt tell them you were part of your fund's effort to short sell theirs into oblivion. Maybe you really are sorry though. What you‚Äôre more sorry about, however, is that your bonuses are probably going to be shit for a few years. They could even dip into five figures, god forbid. Your thoughts are of course directed to the millions of people losing their jobs across the country by the news, but inevitably your bonus reduction resurfaces as your biggest concern. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I can do anything,‚Äù you say, after downing some wine. You go to sleep fairly easily, while across the country, innumerable people are forced to contemplate moving.

**Let‚Äôs jump ahead a few more years**

It‚Äôs mid-March, 2020. At this point, its become evident that COVID-19 is going to ravage the world, in some capacity (not gonna put politics into this because that‚Äôs not the point). As either a CEO or senior executive at a mid-range hedge fund, your thoughts gravitate towards your craft. It‚Äôs clear the market is going to tank, so you do what you do best. You short the shit out of several clearly sinking industries (https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/investing/short-sellers-market-coronavirus/index.html). But you don't stop there. You go on CNBC, Fox Business, maybe even the BBC, and announce doom and gloom. Doing this will get people to dump their stocks, meaning your shorts print even more money. Oh well, if there‚Äôs a positive to be gained from this whole thing it‚Äôs your fund making good money, right? By late March or early April, your wife convinces you that going with the kids to the Hampton‚Äôs would be the best choice, since the upper east side is getting a little claustrophobic. You‚Äôll need to cancel your two week St. Barts vacation, what a bummer. You rent out a nice beach house in Sag Harbor for 125k a month, managing to beat out the other bidder by upping them by 10k. Once again, millions of people are losing their jobs, and you‚Äôre shorting the companies they work for. What else should you do? 

**Only a few months forward this time**

It‚Äôs October. Weeks turned into months, and while you‚Äôve started getting back to the city more and more, you‚Äôre still staying in Sag. Sometimes you have family friends over for an ostensibly socially distanced wine + cigar. You don‚Äôt think much of the events of the summer, aside from that one tweet you had PR send out in July. Your kids might have thoughts, you haven‚Äôt asked. 

**Just a few more months, I promise**

It‚Äôs January. For really no other reason than the prospect of making more money, you along with a few other funds have decided to open naked shorts on GameStop. While technically not allowed, there are loopholes. Why would the loopholes be there, if not to be exploited, right? Not like you don‚Äôt do the same thing with your taxes.

**Then, the unthinkable happens**

A bunch of retail investors, led by a specific part of Reddit, decide to fuck your position by dramatically raising the share price. Since you firmly believe these people incapable of sticking to such an audacious play, you do nothing. Before long though, you start to become slightly unnerved by how steady the growth of the stock is. It's approaching $100, and you're losing hundreds of thousands to millions every day on short interest. So, you decide to take action. You get on CNBC, and cry about fundamentals. About volatility crushing these people. They don't listen, and keep buying. A week passes with you and your rich friends trying various strategies, none of it working. You're aware of another fund leaning on a popular trading app to force them into not accepting buy orders for GME, amongst others. You're  not above sacrificing pride for money, so you announce your fund has closed its shorts. You're lying, of course. What kind of looks what you get at future parties if you cowed to these people? No, fuck that. You've read all the right books, been to the right schools, made the right friends, networked at the right parties and functions. You will not close, everything in your life has conditioned you not to. In fact, you'll double down. You go on CNBC some more. Artificially lower the stock price by trading between a few other funds. None of it's working, and you're intensely aware of another potential gamma squeeze on Friday. Restrictions on buying help during the day, but after hours, the stock jumps. That momentum carries it into a solid Friday. You won't budge, but at this point you're losing millions of dollars a day. 

**So, here we are**

These people do not care about you. You're the least of their concerns, actually. They care about money and fund image, in that order. We have a real chance to make guys exactly like this hurt where it counts (for them), and I want people to understand that. I'm not saying throw your rent into GME. I'm saying you have the chance to really be a part of something, to screw the people that have been doing the screwing for your whole life. The house has been running a fixed casino, and you have the chance to hit back. 

**Do not close. We have them, and they know it. We're winning, and if we keep winning they will give in.**"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185652.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['CEO', 'MBA', 'GS', 'I', 'CEO', 'CNBC', 'BBC', 'PR', 'I', 'A', 'CNBC', 'A', 'GME', 'CNBC', 'I', 'GME']|['GS', 'BBC', 'GME', 'GME']

This may be only chance for little guys to overcome whales.¬†



# Stock Market In Its Default

For the past centuries of stock trading, riches had most power on stocks. The idea that a stock can be traded on an expectation basis is a scam where big whales can bait little fish‚Äôs money and start devouring on it. You may disagree with me but first let‚Äôs consider an example.¬†

A company makes $100 profit an year. The company IPOs with $1000 market cap. Whales hold 40% of the shares as initial bagholders.

* Case 1: nobody wants to trade the stock.¬†  
If nobody traded any stock, the stock will sit sideways and no-one will gain or lose money. i.e. rich will not gain nor lose money.¬†
* Case 2: the company is popular and people look to buy at IPO.  
Obviously in this case, stock prices will increase with little guy‚Äôs $110, $120 bid until riches start selling their stock at $200. If the stock gets sold back to $100, all of the little guys lost money while whales gained profit even when the stock price(our baseline case) has remained the same.¬†
* Case 3: the company is performing poorly, and less people want the stock.  
In this case, rich people will sell for $100, $90, $80... and only little guys will buy in the stocks with decreasing stock price. The rich people who initially bought the stock in at $50 or less has still come out of profit while little guys lose money due to the decreasing stock prices.¬†

See how whales as initial bagholders always win money!

Wait, this is too much math! I don‚Äôt get it!  
Don‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôll give a simple summary. Whales can initially invest in a company for a way lower price than us. Once the company IPOs they build up their wealth over little guy‚Äôs money flooding into the stock. Notice that stock market is ultimately a zero sum game, and odds are in favor of whales who had early invested in the company.


Some may argue the above is false given that more people tend to hold the stock over time with an expectation. Now, here is what is interesting.

* Let's consider a company which doesn't hold any debt or any liquidity. The company is 50% owned by whales. The company IPOs at $100 a share (at 20 PE).  
Notice that company holds no money nor debt. In reality, the company should be valued at 0. But whales who are the initial bagholders of this game can sell their 50% ownership at $100 a share due to the ""expectation"". This is the magic of turning $0 worth company into $100 a share company.
* But what if the company will worth more in 10 years? Then, whales who held onto the stock will be able to sell the stocks at 20PE after 10 years (whether it be $1000 or $10000).

Do you see the game here? The initial bagholders always come out of profit. They are the BANK of this system and will build up the wealth using the little guys. Moreover, the big guys tend to trade on a premature company information which gives them an advantage of early moves.

But, is this bad? NO. It's not a bad thing. It's just how market is built. Just remember, in an ordinary market, little guys will tend to lose money because the market is ultimately a zero sum. The initial investors will always come out better.


# GME, AMC, etc. Case

Now the story gets even more fascinating. In these stocks cases, whales were not the ""initial bagholders"". Instead, they held a short selling position of the stocks. Retails came in and bought the stocks, and became the ""initial bagholders""

Do you remember from the above that initial bagholders always win? This is the case where initial bagholders were the retails. Whales didn't have time to get in or had the priority of getting the pre-IPO shares. Instead, their shorts will print money into the stocks as the move continues. Due to the short selling restrictions, whales who hugely shorted these stocks ""MUST"" continue purchasing the stocks, which will increase the stock prices even further.

We can apply this in a macroscopic view. If we think of GME as a market where one can invest and Citadel as a bank, then this is a case where the bank Citadel is always backing the GME market (unlimited QE) as long as preconditions are met. The precondition here is that share price has to be above the short strike price. Then, the market will only keep growing until the bank has no more money to print. Retails who are now the early investors, or ""initial bagholders"", will be for a first time bagholders of a giantly large market.


# Scenarios

* The best case is when retails continue buying/holding onto the stocks until Citadel's unlimited QE finally ends in the market. As long as the preconditions continue to meet, there will be unlimited QE for the GME market.
* The worst case is when retails panic sell the stocks and the stocks go to bottom. This will allow Citadel to print money from their shorts, and it means that there is no unlimited QE. Only retails were hurt in the case.


# What I am doing

I am a retail myself and will obviously side with retails. I am also very angry especially at the stinky game going on behind the scenes of these trading platforms, and will not forgive them. I will continue HOLDing with my üíéüôå  until everyoneüöÄüöÄüöÄ to üåúüåúüåúüåú

Robinhood has betrayed us. For the year I have commented here (was previously a lurker on an alt account) I have always stuck up for them. You would hear it all the time ‚Äúswitch to a real broker‚Äù ‚ÄúRobinhood is shit‚Äù. Despite its flaws RH revolutionized trading and many of us would not be where we are today without it, including myself. I have always been a strong advocate for them. But what we have seen the past days is unforgivable and I cannot, in good faith, bring myself to continue using their service.

The smoke is still clearing, and while it seems blatantly obvious that Robinhood has maliciously colluded against us, nothing is clear yet and despite the circumstances I like to give the benefit of the doubt. So I come to you with this proposition.

Shorty is a politically connected trust fund asshole who got into Harvard/Yale on legacy. You never worked a day in your life, but your congressman/hedgefund daddy gets you a job at Citadel because your daddy is friends with the head muckity muck and then you go on to start a long/short hedge fund that invests in fruits. 

You want to buy a shiny apple at $120 thinking it will be $130, but you don't want to just buy a shiny apple with your own money - you want to buy the apple with someone else's money, so you borrow 3 oranges from some reddit retard who thinks you have his best interest at heart. You immediately sell the 3 oranges at $40 a piece to buy a shiny apple at $120. You do this because you think the apple is worth more and will appreciate more, but, you turn into a greedy asshole. You then go on TV and tell everyone that oranges are cancerous to scare people into getting rid of their oranges and bring the price down to $20 so that you only have to pay the reddit retard half of what you sold the oranges for. 

This works for a while. More greedy rich assholes follow your lead and sell to each other to the point where 40 retards sell their 40 oranges to these assholes, who sell to each other, making the total number of oranges borrowed outstanding now 70.

This is ok, as long as the orange is worth less than the apple. You sold 3 oranges at $40 and bought a shiny apple and now the apple is worth 130 and the oranges are worth $20, so you made more than the $10 that increased in the value of the apple (130-20*3=70). 

However, something bad happens - Reddit retards notice not enough oranges exists to cover what you and your friends owe, so they decide to buy up all the oranges to raise the price of oranges. Unfortunately for you, this works. And now, oranges are worth $195... So what is your account worth? Negative.

How? You still owe 3 oranges, just they're now worth $195, and all you have is 1 shiny apple worth $130 to show for it. Your net position on this trade is now worth ($130-$585 = -$455)... Did I forget, that you are also paying 28% interest on the $455, only increasing the amount you owe day after day? You sweat, you panic, you tell your friend at CNBC to tell everyone everything is ok and that you closed your position when you know - you literally can't as you cry and shit yourself and avoid being seen in public as much as you can and keep ignoring you prime brokers phone calls asking for more margin, hoping Robinhood will save you, but they don't, and those oranges are now worth $325 each and its only the first week...

Fuck Robinhood.

Hey GME gang, I've been trying to figure why I'm feeling sour when I'm sitting here on a Friday, enjoying a 10 bagger on my GME plays and a celebratory tumbler of whiskey. It certainly has everything to do with Robinhood--those fuckers sold my $310 call expiring today at 11:09 a.m. PT with no notice, no questions, nothing (you might recognize 11:09 a.m. PT as basically the low point of the day; that option was worth about $10k at 3:55 today) and they sold it for a grand. Thanks, fuckers!

But no, that's not the reason I'm writing this post. I'm writing because I'm pissed off about the screenshot I stole from another post by u/tsukune_surprise. I'm sure we all know about the infamous ladder selling by now that hedge funds use to force down the price to artificial lows. What's eating me up is that, while they certainly employed this bullshit tactic before in our run from $20 to $300+ at present, the results have never been so dramatic as they were today and yesterday. You all know the reason--up until yesterday, WSB and our allies would buy back those shares right away, on the cheap. Now, of course, I'm guessing at least half of our people can't hardly do shit but watch it crash thanks to Robinhood and others who suspended buying in GME.

You can see it plainly in the level two data when ladder selling occurs. To put it bluntly, there are virtually **no buyers and only sellers**. We all know there's no shortage of demand for shares, but the price continues to drop. These fuckers are gaming the system to spite us and if we sit on our hands, there's nothing we can do about it.

So here's the rub: Get off your butt, pick up your phone, log onto your computer, do whatever you have to to #DumpRobinhood and get on a platform that actually supports its people. My portfolio transfer to **Fidelity** is happening as we speak and I hope I'm not the only one. Thanks for reading and stay angry at the powers that be. This is our moment and we can't waste it because of some bullshit app.

Silver is the most manipulated and corrupted market in Wall Street. Big hedges have been suppressing the price for years to hide inflation from there corrupt friends at the FED and ultimately have leveraged hundreds of times more paper silver than actually silver in existence. 

Silver is in more demand then ever and the supply will only shrink. In silver highs the price in today‚Äôs money would be 600$-1000$. And now it floats at 25$ when the highs in the 80s where in the 50$ range. It is so absurd and if we can all recognize this we truly could take down the entire establishment starting from the hedges down all the way to our corrupted federal reserve that has literally printed most of the money supply in the past year, which in theory should send silver flying to the moon but is being suppressed by the crooks on Wall Street to hide inflation and make you poorer.

TL;DR

BUY SILVER TAKE DOWN THE ESTABLISHMENT, something we all agree on. $SLV should literally be in the high hundreds if not thousands if we can all unite.

It‚Äôs becoming clearer and clearer what is coming in the future. As Robinhood restricts purchases on owning more than 1 share in multiple tickers, we can extrapolate why they are pulling every illegal move in the book.

They are out of money. You‚Äôve heard liquidity crisis, well it means they don‚Äôt have enough money to pay for our fair legally made gains. Hence the $1 Billion dollar infusion. Decimating the clearing house may restructure parts of the economy, but it was never our fault.

Melvin, Citadel, all these short positions took on a stupid bet. We‚Äôve been taught to never go full retard but that exactly what they‚Äôve been doing, shorting over +100% of the physical shares. Their bad investment cannot be blamed on us small investors just because we bought the stock we like.

Now they‚Äôre taking proactive, not reactive measures because they know what is to come. Forcing low prices to scoop up users who‚Äôve invested on margin. Selling to each other to simulate a sell off that will never come. Literally saying you can‚Äôt buy the most basic investment, a single share. 

For now, we hold. Everyday we hold, they lose billions. Every day they lose billions due to their own position, we inch closer to the inevitable payout. A payout they can‚Äôt afford. If they continue to hold their losing position, what is to come is bankruptcy. The upside is, we can hold this stock longer than they can take on debt.

‚ÄúWe can stay retarded longer than they can remain solvent‚Äù is not a joke considering their retarded position.
Here‚Äôs some post I stole of some nerd on the internet: 

In this case, collateral requirements on GME went up. Because of its volatility. So while before Robinhood had to pony up collateral for a few shares of GME for every hundred it traded, it now had to, at close of business, pony up one hundred shares' worth of collateral for every hundred it traded. That creates a cash crunch. One that exacerbates itself with every additional trade in the security. If Robinhood fails to satisfy those collateral calls, they go out of business overnight.

So when Citadel and Robinhood can‚Äôt pay out, despite telling people to shut up and sell, remember it was never our fault. 

Position: 24 shares of GME, not selling until I see billionaires go homeless for betting against Americans

Enjoy your weekend fucking idiots. Go spend some time with your family.

P.S. And to the SEC, you have a choice. Either restrict Americans from buying a single share on the free market setting a precedent of market manipulation or force shorts to close out some of their mind-numbingly stupid positions just like they did to us.

Edit: I see your concerns about what happens if they bankrupt or the stock plummets. Your cash is insured up to a certain amount $250,000 if a bankruptcy occurs. 
The stock will only plummet if people mass sell, but it‚Äôs not happening. The news, the movement all üöÄfuel imo. Don‚Äôt sell, we are stronger together. My investment advice has always been, don‚Äôt put in anything you can‚Äôt afford to lose. That way you are always protected. Thank you for the awards, buy GME."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185649.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['FREE', 'GME', 'A', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'P', 'S', 'SEC', 'I', 'GME']|['FREE', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Hundreds of thousands have joined in and rallied alongside us while others have scolded us for being reckless and harmful and stating that we should be investigated or sued. 

Either way, I think it's fair to say that this has been a once in a lifetime scenario and a lot of us have come upon some money that we didn't expect to have. 

In the spirit of being the smooth brains we are, we still have a lot of work to üíéü§≤ until Melvin's wife's boyfriend can't buy the prada bag he wants. But, once the shorts fully cover  and the tendies are secured I think it's only right for us to give back a little because we know how good it feels when the tendies are spread around.

So, I propose that, when the dust settles, the mods set up a way for us to all donate money as a group to some charities or efforts of our choice (maybe we can vote and split funds by percentage). Together we can show that we're not the greedy fucks that we're taking this money from and can raise a lot of money for great causes and I think that's a pretty good way to start off 2021.

If so, then that shit's fucked and fuck them.

These last two days we‚Äôve seen insane backlash against RH, and, on the surface, for seemingly good reason: they restricted our ability to purchase GME among other shares, at a very important time! THEY SUPPRESSED RETAIL DEMAND DURING A SHORT SQUEEZE.

But I don‚Äôt think this was a decision they willingly made, nor do I think they made it in defense of the shorters (although it did inadvertently help them).

I‚Äôve read a few things, and correct me if I‚Äôm mistaken about any of them, that point to the clearing houses being responsible for RH‚Äôs inability to allow its customers to trade. The most recent evidence showcasing over 50+ shares that they‚Äôre restricting trading on, clearly indicates RH is experiencing a liquidity crisis. Why? Clearing houses increased RH‚Äôs margin requirements while conducting trades in their behalf. Not just RH‚Äôs, but many other brokers as well. 

When a trade is made, the clearing house is the intermediary. Let say you want to buy 1k of GME. RH takes your order, and gives it to the clearing house (it goes through citadel too but let‚Äôs ignore that for a moment) and the house finds a seller. They match you together, and the clearing house buys (with their own money) the share you want, gives it to you, and gets your money, but not right away. It typically processes for something around 2 days. They provide temporary liquidity to guarantee sellers get their funds immediately, and they require RH to also put up a portion of that temporary liquidity, as collateral (margin).

So what happened? The margin RH was required to put up increased from anywhere from 30% to 100%. That means if you buy 1k of shares, RH used to only need to show 300. Now they have to show 1k. And if they don‚Äôt, I assume they end up out of compliance, which leaves them liable to a lot of bad shit.

What happens if RH doesn‚Äôt have the liquidity to show 100% margin? They can‚Äôt take your trade, because they‚Äôd be out of compliance! So they reduce the amount of shares customers can buy to remain within liquidity margins. Same for other brokers as well. It seems really bad with RH however, because now they‚Äôve increased their reduced stock list to companies like Starbucks and GM. Wild. And with all the public backlash, customers are also probably trying to withdraw funds, causing a liquidity crisis feedback loop.

Now here‚Äôs the part that worries me, and again, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. RH innovated by allowing retail traders to trade for free, without fees. Their competition was forced to capitulate to these new standards. No fees, means easier trades for retail. Primarily, in the past, retail‚Äôs most common trade (and still probably today) were long term holds. If RH goes away, there‚Äôs a chance we see a reiteration of trading fees.

There‚Äôs also a chance we see more option restrictions on retail as well. The squeezes we‚Äôve been seeing happened, in part, because a purchase of an option causes the seller to go out and purchase shares to cover, in case the option is exercised.

I do not own any stonks of any kind; I didn't get in early because I'm not a stocker (you guys call yourselves stockers right? Or something like that?), didn't get in late because my financial state most of my adult life has been ""driven deep into the red by anything from minor car problems to excessively chunky peanut butter"". (Don't worry, I'm safe by virtue of having a dad in IT who foolishly believes I deserve to survive off my two kitchen jobs like some pinko commie).

If I could have made it in, I would have pulled out just enough for some minor financial security, maybe a few thousand or 10k's (I used to make $1600 a month working 80 hour weeks and I've still never had multiple thousands at once, so I assume that's the ""normal people range""); and then I would not have tried to game the squeeze at all. I would ride into the crash just to spite the broken system and the fucked up people fucking it up.

My situation is only indirectly due to 2008 and previous fuck ups; I never lost my job because of the crashes or anything. It's been a combination of coming of age exactly during the post-housing world (I was literally graduating at the time), a very long and constant stream of bad luck and mental health issues (sadly not stupidity or I would've ended up here), and just being stuck on low rungs for everything because I started on the low rungs and only people on higher rungs can climb rungs. Rungs doesn't sound like a word anymore. Ruuuuuungs. Wrungs.

I realize that there are worst-case scenarios where the entire market implodes, and as one of the little guys I'm probably going to be hurt by that. I realize that if you guys win, you'll be the new suits. Hell I know that some of you are already wearing nice pants. But fuck it. Fuck the people who treat human lives like a game, AND cheat at that game, AND are bad at it and just don't fucking care and don't have to. People need to learn there are consequences.

I'm anxious and scared of the possibility of the entire market disintegrating and the world becoming a post-apocalyptic hellscape instead of the current during-apocalypse hellscape. I'm defeated by the likelihood that I will wake up one day and things will have returned to normal and nothing will change. I'm dissociating because this is such a huge historical event and I'm just watching it in fucking real time while I play Animal Crossing. I'm annoyed because I'm just listing my emotions and the reasons I feel them and that seems lazy and boring and you guys probably don't even understand what letters are.

Throughout all of this, I've felt compelled to remember two key facts: 


1) We are the good guys in this situation 

2) We are not the littlest fish in the room

&nbsp;

Point 1 is obvious to basically the whole world right now ‚Äî our diamond hands have been forged under the pressure of cold, ruthless, faceless billionaires trying hard to squash us. No arguments from almost anyone on this point.

&nbsp;

Point 2, though, is easy to overlook. This whole thing is about taking back from the greedy ultra-rich and redistributing the wealth to the common folk. Still, this leaves out a part of the picture. Just about everyone who has a brokerage account with a few grand they're willing to lose is, on the grand scale, relatively fortunate. There are billions of people worldwide who couldn't imagine ever risking five grand, and many of them couldn't imagine making that much in the first place. Tons of our fellow citizens are starving, wondering how to make ends meet ‚Äî especially right now, in the middle of a pandemic with crazy unemployment. I know I'm lucky to be secure enough to focus my energy on this for hours a day.

&nbsp;

I've been here since around 2014 and I love this community. Now we have an opportunity to do some good, and to simultaneously show the world that our money is, literally, where our mouth is: that we truly **believe** in the principle of not being excessively greedy, and allowing those in less fortunate positions to share in the wealth. This is why I'm committing to donating at least 5% of my profits to St Jude Children's Hospital, and another 5% to Water.org, after I sell GME for $42069 a share. Who's in?

How Clearing Demands Helped Ground the WallStreetBets Stocks

Telis Demos

‚Ä¢

&#x200B;

Last Updated January 29, 2021, 6:33 PM

When some online brokers including Robinhood Markets Inc. and Webull Financial LLC moved this week to restrict trading in GameStop Corp., AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and other stocks, fueled by Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, they did so in part because of obligations with clearinghouses that help ensure trading across the market isn't disrupted by defaults. Here's how it works.

&#x200B;

What is a clearinghouse?

&#x200B;

Consider the basics of trading: Buyers and sellers must agree on a price. The buyer then must pay the seller, and ownership must be formally transferred.

&#x200B;

Enter clearinghouses. The clearinghouse collects and distributes payments and transfers ownership. So traders are free to focus just on price, and to take the best price in the market regardless of who is offering it. Neither side has to worry about the other's ability to pay.

&#x200B;

For stocks in the U.S., the main clearinghouse is National Securities Clearing Corp., which is part of a larger clearing organization that operates in other markets, called Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.

&#x200B;

How do they work?

&#x200B;

Clearinghouses serve to mutualize risk. Members keep cash or collateral such as Treasury securities at the clearinghouse to cover their own activities and the obligations of other members should they fail. The clearinghouse might ask the members to post more of this money, often known as margin, if they are making riskier trades. The aim is to ensure that no individual member's failure causes the whole system to collapse.

&#x200B;

How does the financial crisis figure in this?

&#x200B;

In response to the 2008 collapse of broker-dealer Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., lawmakers writing the Dodd-Frank Act sought to beef up supervision of clearinghouses and to push more trading into clearinghouses. The focus was primarily on so-called over-the-counter derivatives, like credit-default swaps, that didn't have a central marketplace. The reforms also affected some longstanding clearinghouses, including National Securities Clearing Corp., by designating them as systemically important financial market utilities, which subjected them to greater regulatory scrutiny.

&#x200B;

Why would a clearinghouse have to increase requirements?

&#x200B;

As noted earlier, margin requirements often rise with risk. A sharp rise in the price of any security raises the prospect that it will decline just as fast, potentially adding to the risk of those trading and holding as collateral these securities.

&#x200B;

A challenge in the stock market is that settlement is not instant. The system allows two days after the day a trade happens until the shares and money must change hands, known as ""T+2"" settlement. Over those two days, the risk that a party might be unable to complete a trade can, in rare circumstances, change dramatically based on market conditions.

&#x200B;

One such circumstance might be when the price of a security is extraordinarily volatile. In that case, the seller is exposed to increased risk that in the event of a failure of a buyer to pay up, the security they would be stuck still owning is worth dramatically less. The extraordinary volatility of a stock like GameStop would increase such a concern.

&#x200B;

Another is the risk that a party suddenly owes an outsize amount of cash. In a normal market, any clearing member likely has a mostly balanced book of buys and sells, meaning they are both paying and receiving cash. And often many of their own customers' trades cancel each other, meaning they have no net obligation to the clearinghouse. But when a firm has a huge imbalance of buy orders, its obligation to pay cash skyrockets. This may have been the case this week, when there was much demand for just one or two stocks.

&#x200B;

So who decides it's time to increase margin requirements?

&#x200B;

How a clearinghouse judges these risks, and therefore when it makes demands for more upfront funds, is typically formulaic. Margins can be based on equations such as value-at-risk. Exactly how the formula works, and who is responsible for losses in what order, are important elements. In the case of National Securities Clearing Corp., losses would be covered by the defaulting member's funds before the clearinghouse's own funds or other members' funds would be used.

&#x200B;

A broker like Robinhood would also have to make decisions about its own capital, and how much it was willing or able to tie up in settlement. A broker may face separate obligations for capital levels, like with the SEC. Other brokers also clear via another intermediary -- like Apex Clearing, through which WeBull clears -- that is a member. These intermediaries may have their own risk controls they apply to their clients.

The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.

>The chaos we saw this last week was due to a squeeze experienced by the hedges that were holding a lot of naked GME shorts that did not have cash or stock on hand to cover their position when the stock blew up. A lot of other funds may still be in deep in covered shorts (they hold actual stock in addition to what they borrowed and short sold) which is pretty safe and neutral. Some may have small naked short positions and they may be seeking small share buys to cover or close them, or simply cashing them out for a loss isn't a major hit. Many of these short positions don't have a fixed timeline and are stable so long as the short continues to pay interest. Today GME was pretty quiet and I think the fluctuations were due to half of WSB selling and the other half buying.

I think the major squeeze is squoze. Certainly most of the major bleeding by the hedge funds over GME is done, as any of them with any sort of exposure and brain cells are covering if they weren't already. Some hedge fund managers actually know how to hedge.

Upshot is...this isn't going to go down like the VW short squeeze in 2008. Back then only a few players controlled the vast majority of the stock. In the GME situation the stock and shorts are dispersed over far more organizations and individuals.

If you have information or data to the contrary, I'd love to see it.

&#x200B;

**BUT WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN LIEUTENANT** u/Brassmonkeynutzz?

&#x200B;

Ok. Let's start with the basics for all of you who are wet behind the ears. What is a Gamma squeeze you ask? A Gamma squeeze occurs when option sellers/market makers buy shares of the underlying stock to hedge their positions/prepare for the possibility that call option buyers decide to exercise their right to buy. This type of hedge is necessary when a significant amount of call option strikes are expiring in the money (last week all available strikes expired in the money on a stock for the first time in financial history and this week a shit load of strikes expired in the money as well).

&#x200B;

Wait, you aren't actually reading this are you? If you are, I appreciate you. For those of you who cannot read (all of you), please see the TL;CR at the bottom of this post. (Hint: üöÄ)

&#x200B;

Anyways, you might be wondering, why would Robinhood risk its reputation and entire business by limiting its customers ability to buy? Simple: ""Robinhood‚Äôs regulatory filings show the company charges large investment firms called ‚Äúmarket makers‚Äù (üëøCITADEL/MELVIN) fees to access real-time information about which stocks its users are buying and selling, a practice some regulators and industry watchers have seen as a potential conflict of interest."" In fact, ""Robinhood routes more than half of its customer orders to Citadel, by far its largest market-making partner by volume, Robinhood disclosures show."" ([source](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/robinhood-and-citadels-relationship-comes-into-focus-as-washington-vows-to-examine-stock-market-moves/ar-BB1ddG06))

&#x200B;

In other words, Robinhood is more concerned about saving the GAY BEARS üåàüêª that they are in bed with (their real customers - üëøCITADEL/MELVIN) than servicing retail investors like us. Ironically, Robinhood is taking from the poor and giving to the rich‚Äîit is ass backwards.

&#x200B;

Before I go any further, I have to once again congratulate all of the true autists who have diamond handed üôåüèªüíéthus far. Thank you for holding. You are truly retarded and I salute you. And of course, I salute our King, u/DeepFuckingValueü§¥, with the utmost respect. We fought valiantly in ""The Great Battle for Valhalla"" today. And it is very promising that EVEN DESPITE Robinhood limiting our retarded power, we went from closing at 196 yesterday to 328 at close today, and 312 as I write this post. But clearly, this infinity war is far from over.

&#x200B;

If you sold like a paper handed pussy üìÑü§öüèªüôÄ, then you are not a true WSB autist soldier. You are not one of us. Go invest in an ETF and leave this sub forever!

&#x200B;

**But I am a true autist, what can I do?**

&#x200B;

First things first, GTFO of Robinhood immediately if you do not have options expiring within the next week and transfer your portfolio to literally any other brokerage.  **(EDIT: Transferring will lock up your shares/portfolio until the transfer is complete, which could take a week or so; so only transfer now if you are ok with that‚ÄîI am just so disgusted with RH at this point that I almost don't care and will be diamond handing my shares for more than a week most likely anyways).**  They are fucking criminals and they are trying to delay/mitigate the MOASS. I am personally transferring to **(EDIT) FIDELITY** unless you tards have a better suggestion.

&#x200B;

For those of you who were clenching when we got down to around 126 yesterday and around 250 today. I know you were scared. But the following cannot be overstated: **THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT! FEAR!!!!!**

&#x200B;

**JUST FUCKING HOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!** THEY WANT YOUR FUCKING SHARES SO BAD BECAUSE THERE IS A HUGE SHORTAGE.

&#x200B;

**HOLD THE MOTHERFUCKING LINE AND WE RIDE TO VALHALLA!**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Shortage? YES A FUCKING SHORTAGE. Over 100% shares are still shorted. Do not listen to anyone who says Melvin Capital has closed out their short position. That is total bullshit.

&#x200B;

But, but, but, WhY iS CNBC AdVeRtIsInG tHaT MeLvIn ClOsEd iTs sHoRt pOsItiOn tHeN ü§™? ([Great post talking about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8539h/cnbc_now_running_ads_promoting_that_melvin/)) I mean seriously, ask yourselves, why the fuck would CNBC run paid advertisements about the shorts closing their positions? BECAUSE THE BIG BOYS WANT YOU TO THINK THE SQUEEZE IS OVER SO YOU SELL AND GIVE UP. FEAR NOT; THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZEN!

&#x200B;

**Think about it:** if Melvin closed its short position, it would simply move on to the next trade and never look back. There would not be any reason to ***pay*** to advertise that.

&#x200B;

**Summary:** the big dogs want you to think the squeeze is over, and they want you to panic and sell your shares. DO...NOT...DO...IT! Instead, **HOLD! BUY THE DIP! REPEAT!**

&#x200B;

**Monday, we ride at dawn!**

Nothing. Robinhood just kept saying ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt process your request because you will make us go fucking bankrupt if the sell order is that far out‚Äù

Then he tried $8,000. Boom. It worked.

So I told him to try putting a high limit on another stock.

He could put any limit he wanted on any other stock without issue.

What does this mean?

This means that $50,000 is NOT a meme.

**AS LONG AS YOU KEEP CONTROL OF THE SHARES. YOU CONTROL THE SHARE PRICE. BASIC SUPPLY/DEMAND**

There are literally not enough shares available for Melvins side of the bet to work out. The math just simply doesn‚Äôt check out for him. This whole situation wouldn‚Äôt have happened if he didn‚Äôt make a horrible bet. 

If we all have $69,420 sell orders (imo, this is a very conservative and fair entry point for GME investors) then when Melvin starts closing their massive positions, the market will be absolutely flooded with buy orders. Eventually, those buy orders will find our $69,420 wall and eat it right up. The supply of shares to fulfill his side of the bet literally doesn‚Äôt exist. There aren‚Äôt enough shares‚Äîso theoretically, the price can go infinitely. In two months, you can invent a number and then request that number for your shares‚ÄîMelvins gotta pay it.

All you gotta do is have those shares when he‚Äôs looking for them. We‚Äôve got this. Everyone has our backs. The *only* way for them to get out of this is if we sell, or if they break the law with the whole world watching.

1. To continue operating, it drew on a line of credit from six banks amounting to between [$500 million and $600 million](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25954882)
2. They had to raise an [emergency $1 billion from investors today.](https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-raised-1-billion-from-investors-handle-trading-surge-nyt-2021-1)
3. They stopped allowing users to buy GME and other meme stonks for a full day yesterday.
4. They have severely limited or [blocked 50+ stocks](https://twitter.com/philipwutang/status/1355301805933080577), including lots of non meme stonks. More are likely.
5.

6. There [appears to be a bank run](https://twitter.com/GerberKawasaki/status/1355274012151042049) on Robinhood as people are fed up with the restrictions, this is a negative feedback loop.

If Robinhood goes under the SEC will freeze all the accounts. The SIPC protects up to $500k in accounts. It takes months to unwind and get your money back. You might want to move any free floating money now or get out of any positions that aren't üíéüôå.

it was a crazy week for most of us due to GME and other volatile stocks. Companies standing behind trading apps like Robinhood have imposed restrictions on trading GME stocks. Where to trade if not on Robinhood? 

Look for trading accounts via banks like brokerage checking accounts. Banks charge fees but you are going to be sure you won't get fucked by them just like by Robinhood or Trading 212 fintechs.

If you're using trading apps to invest in stocks at least read terms of services so you would know what to expect if shit hits the fan. Some brokers have their headquarters in financial havens like Cayman Islands. Did you know that? That is why I chose banks.

There is a lot of pros for using banks to invest:

* When you make an order through bank you have certainity that your order will be executed instantly on the market
* Banks don't sell data about your trades to hedge funds
* There is no conflict of interest beetwen you as an investor and your bank becouse it charges fee, so the more you make the more bank makes - win - win situation (they have no interest to fuck you, they want you to make more and more money)
* Banks can provide a lot of analytic tools and real, fast support in case of some issues

I hope you are going to rethink using frauded brokers like Robinhood or Trading 212, they don't play fair, they fuck us so why shouldn't we fuck them by denying to use them and destroying their reputation?

**Gamestop last day of the quarter is this Saturday.** If they report a blow out quarter then that's more ammunitions for this. **A blow out quarter is basically GAMEOVER for the shorts.** We will have back ups from the whales everywhere swarming in.

Go to your local Gamestop store today and tomorrow and buy everything in the store with your GME tendies!

Most of you are now newly minted millionaires! So get out there and buy the shit out of your local Gamestop. If there is no Gamestop in your area, **shop online** (omnichannel) on their website. Don't play games? No problem, buy gift for your wife's boyfriends kids. DONATE to local charity!

TLDR; Shop at Gamestop using GME tendies so they can report blow out quarter which in turn will give you even more GME tendies. Its like you reinvested your dividend! This been bought up before but need to bring back up cause last day of quarter is this Saturday!

March might be a long timer away but remember while some have covered, some are entering with new position at the 300s and some even entering at the high. So this will turn into a WAR of attrition, whoever the fuck gives up first win. I been in this shit for 2.5 weeks now. So get in the fucking trenches and bunker down! We going to hit higher high and higher low.

&#x200B;

Congrats on holding the line above $320 today. 

&#x200B;

As sad as it is, some of us would like to exit our GME position at some point in our lives. To strategize for this, I decided to do some quick math.

&#x200B;

As most of you degenerates know, VW temporarily became the most valuable company in the world in the great squeeze of '08. Well, why can the same not happen to GME? Surely, some will argue about the difference in the underlying financials between the two stocks. But to that, I ask, was VW ever shorted by 140%? Fuck no.

Let's do some quick math.

&#x200B;

Apple is the worlds most valuable company, at $2.215T.

GME has 69.75M shares outstanding

For GME to become the world's most valuable company, each share should be worth at least:

$2.215T / 69.75M = **$31,756 per share**

&#x200B;

Given the historical precedent of major squeezes becoming the world's most valuable company, I will be setting my limit value at **no less than $30,000 per share.**

&#x200B;

$1000 is not a meme. $5000 is not a meme. $10,000 is not a meme. and even $30,000 is not a meme.

&#x200B;

With that, I recommend a lot of you new guys read up on options trading this weekend and enjoy yourself. When this activity comes back to some sort of normalcy (if it ever does again) you‚Äôll be so god damn confused. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs exercised a call mean?‚Äù No, it does not mean my wife‚Äôs boyfriend went to pound town on her all night. 

‚ÄúWhat is IV crush?‚Äù This is a big one, to be honest I wish everyone could experience IV crush for the first time like I did. I‚Äôll never forget thinking holy fuck I‚Äôm gonna be up thousands at open! Only to lose my ass

‚ÄúThe fuck is theta?‚Äù Can‚Äôt wait to see people freaking out wondering why their call that expires in two days lost half its value 

Anyways, I‚Äôll try and help out a few questions, just keep them slightly less retarded. Beyond that I‚Äôd highly recommend watching some options guides and learning the basics.

God speed retards, and remember to all in GME & AMC on Monday while holding the line!

- Not financial advice I‚Äôm literally a smooth brain myself

Edit1: I wanted to add that you shouldn‚Äôt pay anyone/any site to learn options. There is so much material out there you will be able to learn it without paying. YouTube options basics / Google it and try a few videos out.

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3.

This is the time that we have to fight back in this misinformation campaign as much as possible. We already very clearly see it on reddit with the bots, and I see very blatant false information being spread around like wildfire on tiktok. This is the perfect time to begin a campaign to get as many people informed about the situation as possible.

We have people of all colors, sexualities, genders, and political affiliations here, and we need to take advantage of this unity. People of all political parties need to use this time to create ways to distribute this information to others. We need to focus on doing things like:

* creating infographics for instagram that can easily explain the situation and why we are doing what we are doing. With more visibility on instagram and an easy way to digest it, it is more likely to cause people to become more interested on something that is very intimidating for most people.
* Clear out misinformation thats going on twitter, tiktok, etc. Many people and bots are acting in bad faith and using this as an oppurtunity to spread lies, and we need to SHUT THEM DOWN.
* Weed out the fake investments that only serve to divide us. We need to invest in a core group, and stick with it.
* ***MAKE SURE NEW INVESTORS (+OLD) HAVE A BACKUP NON-ROBINHOOD ACCOUNT***
* Clear out doubts to minimize the panic buying.
* Urge activists of all kinds to put heavy pressure on the government and Robinhood.
* Expand our reach. All eyes are on us, lets make sure it stays that way.
* ***ONE OF OUR MAIN COURSES OF ACTION IS TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENTS HAND INTO INTERVENING WITH ROBINHOOD, WE NEED THE ABILITY TO HAVE PEOPLE MAKE PARTIAL SHARES AND ADD AS MANY STOCKS AS THEY CAN.***

Use whatever tools you have available to spread the word. Leftist political activist pages: post infographics that explain the situation and how Robinhood's actions are unethical and illegal. Meme pages: continue to rally as much attention and hype towards this. Knowledgable investors, compile data and try to explain the technics of how stocks and investing work and try to make it easily digestable, such as explaining terms like short squeeze, etc, for the general public. If all branches of us unite, the stock WILL skyrocket. BUT we need a plan for the next two days. This is why I think we should have a thread like this where we can properly make a plan of action and discuss our method. I will make any edits needed!

> Setting a high limit order gives the clearing firm or third party that your broker may or may be under contract with the ability to see where your position will possibly be sold and gives them the opportunity to continually sell and buy back, some times hundreds of times in a matter of minutes, your position. With high frequency trading this often happens from algorithms or a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù.

1. This is a theory, and I'm not a financial advisor, but I'm not a rapper
2. My thinking is that if üíé‚úãbuys 1/2 a share, the broker has to buy 1 share and credits 1/2 a share to the üíé‚úã 
3. And the broker will keep the other 1/2 a share assuming that another üíé‚úã or (üßª‚úã) will come along shortly to buy that other 1/2 a share
4. And when you increase the pool to a few thousand üíé‚úã, you use some statistical modeling to determine how many full shares to keep on hand to account for a know turn over of fractional shares
5. And then you use that pool of shares as collateral for the cash value you have to pay the üßª‚úãwhen they sell
6. **Here's where it gets tricky** if the volume of purchasing and selling becomes *significantly* higher than normal, then the broker does not know how many shares to have on hand and might not be able to compute all of the transactions in a quick enough fashion to ensure that they don't mess it up bigly
7. So they have to **buy full shares for each fractional share purchased** until they can balance the books and sell off the appropriate number of shares to stay neutral 
8. This makes the dollar value of fractional shares in this fight carry a huge weight, a weight that the brokerage (and the ü©≥'s) can't üêª
9. And through the power of alchemy turns fractional shares to üöÄ fuel

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. I literally can't find any sources online on the mechanics of fractional shares, but I think my speculation *might* be reasonable, but I'm not a rapper

I got out at $60 but my risk tolerance isn‚Äôt super high so I‚Äôm fine with it and enjoying watching all of the gains from the sidelines.

I‚Äôm not trying to rain on the parade but I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about VW, AMC, and GME and their short squeezes. Until this week, and specifically today, I‚Äôve basically been of the mind set that GME is a real squeeze and the others (AMC, etc.) are not. But today I‚Äôve changed my opinion. Please hear me out because I think there is a lot of logic to this.

THE SQUEEZE SQUOZE, NOW IT‚ÄôS SIMPLE SUPPLY DEMAND
Ryan Cohen and GME ruling out bankruptcy are what caused the squeeze. Plain and simple. They created a better outlook and higher genuine value for the company. This gave us a little squeeze forcing shorts to move from their ~140% to ~120% short interest today.

Now that that squeeze occurred and they had to deal with raised price targets, we are simply dealing with very low supply. Shorters are not buying to cover really and lots of retards are buying creating upward movement a momentum. Not much supply. So right now there is no squeeze going on and we are all very dependent on stock lenders margin calling the shorts.


THIS ISN‚ÄôT VW
Just wanted to add a short section here since this event does seem to be the inspiration we all draw from. In this case the shorts did get fucked and got margin called. The lenders did this because there was genuine concern that they would not get there stock back since there is 13x more shorted than there was available. If you buy that 1% and give it back to a lender you have 12% more to go, then you have to buy that 1% from that lender you just got it from, but what if they won‚Äôt sell? There was genuine concern from lenders they would never get their shares back. Total loss.


THESE SHORTS WONT BE MARGIN CALLED ANY TIME SOON
As it currently stands the shorts are paying 30% APR on tens of billions of dollars to the lenders with VERY LITTLE risk in the long term that they will not be able to get the shares back as EVERYBODY (even is, mind you) expects the shares to go back down a lot after this is said and done.

So from a lender‚Äôs perspective, would you rather call your shares back and end the party with huge yearly returns? Or would you rather drag this on for as long as possible and collect fees from shorts? The shorts will happily do it because they don‚Äôt want to lose their shirt, they would rather pay the premium. And even if they did call their shares back, the market would explode and crash before they even had them settled.

Really in the end, we are giving Melvin and the other shorts more time to adjust their position to a more favorable one before it comes back down. So in the end, unlike your believe that bears are fuk, it is retail investors that may be fuk.


CAN GME SQUEEZE HARDER?
I would say probably not soon. It could go higher if people keep buying and holding, but again, in the end retail might end up paying.

The one opportunity I do see would be a share vote or something else that could cause shares to be recalled. But that is unlikely and might not even happen at the yearly investor meeting.


HOW TO MAKE MONEY ON THIS
Honestly without lucky timing retail investors may be fucked here. Premiums on puts make it practically impossible to profit.

WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER SQUEEZES?
Similarly to the current state of GME, we are driving price up and giving shorts better entry and lenders fat APR.

TL;DR: this may be the best trick Wall-street ever played on us. Play acting that they are losing money and Robinhood is their martyr.

Edit: Thanks for commenting everybody. After this interaction I think the squeeze could work out, but it would take insane diamond hands and/or some strong buy pressure. Time and high borrow rates need to ware them down to be sure that this squeeze happens."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185716.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'VW', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'I', 'THE', 'UEEZE', 'QUOZE', 'NOW', 'S', 'IMPLE', 'UPPLY', 'EMAND', 'GME', 'THIS', 'T', 'VW', 'THESE', 'HORTS', 'WONT', 'BE', 'ARGIN', 'ALLED', 'ANY', 'TIME', 'SOON', 'APR', 'VERY', 'ITTLE', 'YBODY', 'CAN', 'GME', 'UEEZE', 'ARDER', 'I', 'I', 'HOW', 'TO', 'MAKE', 'MONEY', 'ON', 'THIS', 'WHAT', 'ABOUT', 'THE', 'OTHER', 'EEZES', 'GME', 'APR', 'I']|['GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

There is only one reason possible for this, they are completely out of money in every way. This is the only weekend activity that they can stop that costs them money. I think they are just praying that when all of the books are settled, they have enough money to cover.

What could these weekend instant deposits amount to? 1M? 2M? This is after the[1B cash infusion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-raises-1-billion-to-meet-surging-cash-demands-11611928504) and [emergency bank loans](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-said-draw-credit-lines-214509076.html). Thursday. And limiting trading on [50 stocks Friday.](https://www.kron4.com/news/robinhood-limits-trading-to-50-major-stocks-what-you-need-to-know/)

To put this news into perspective, when you are almost out of money you pay a large bill late or delay a big purchase. Then you stop eating out, buying extra things, cancel netflix, etc. This is the equivalent of going back through the trash to find the aluminum foil to turn in for pennies at the scrap yard that you walked to cause you can't afford the gas.

**Edit:** I do want to tell people that I don't think that RH is going under. I think they are standing on the precipise. But I think they will get any amount of emergency lending they need to stay solvent. (Too big to fail?)

**You are SIPC insured, to 250K for stonks on RH. You won't lose your money.** Don't sell and move you stocks, don't worry about it. Maybe open a backup broker, maybe move a little cash between the two over the next few weeks. Don't confuse anything I said for investment advice.

Don't use this as financial advice. It's prob. all bs and will get you bankrupt.

Ok, for all my GME autists, things have been rough this week but we've managed to pull through. With that said, I believe this was not just luck or sheer force of will, I think there are hidden actors on our side or, to the very least, profiting from our chaos. Why? Here we go:

1- Retail has been severely handicapped through platforms this week and, even with very few of us still active, we managed to keep the price of GME above 320.

2- During short attacks, especially the last one this Friday, someone went full blown Rambo and managed to fend off the shorters. If you look at the volume Friday in the last 5 minutes, we went 2x in volume to 600k.

3- Retail is running low on funds: most of us retards burned out our money pushing this shit up early in the week and have very few funds left, making impossible to pull these sorts of transaction.

Given the above, I believe some hedge funds have entered the game to try to f**k with their competitors, make money and frame retail as the guilty party of this (potentially taking down RH in the process).

If this is true, and I don't know if it is, next week we need to be extra careful to see what happens after the gamma squeeze finishes. For me, that will mean to keep track of volume because, as soon as these undercover big boys are out, I believe that it is the right time FOR ME to get out.

Either way, what people think? Do we have some MMs helping pour gasoline in the fire?"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185712.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['I', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'RH', 'I', 'I', 'FOR', 'ME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME']

l8brqg|546.0|AMC - What is happening & future?|t3_l8brqg|0.88|1802|1802|hot|2021-01-30 05:40:13.000000|digitalbiz|855|DD|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8brqg/amc_what_is_happening_future/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8brqg/amc_what_is_happening_future/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8brqg/amc_what_is_happening_future/|"Let‚Äôs break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when it‚Äôs time to close the positions of shorted shares and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short position will have to close in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  And, who can forget our grandson GME? 

AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when shorts have to close their positions and as a result of that they themselves take the price higher.

More by u/Common-Buy-2379 in comment section:

AMC is also 49.85% owned by a Chinese holding company. This company controls over 75% of voting shares indirectly, through controlling interest in subsidiaries that also own shares.

They will NOT be bailing out the hedge funds, which would dilute their ownership in the company. They will not be floating their shares for sale during the squeeze.

In all likelihood, the upcoming stock issuance will be sold to larger firms with little interest in assisting the hedges, and will probably remain within Chinese control.

Not financial advice, I just read the 10-k, 8-k, and 10-q, because I like this stock. Also tendies. I love tendies.

To illustrate, If the Chinese owned shares aren't available to fill the shorts, then there's only 13M shares to fill the 44M shorts.

It's WAY shorter than people think.

Positions: 

- 1700 AMC shares balls deep @ 18$ average (~30K)
- 6c AMC 19/3 (10 contracts)

Edit: Earlier I had ‚Äúshorts expire‚Äù in this post which seemingly drew some people crazy ignoring other important aspects. I meant to say when shorts will have to cover their positions. Edited in post.

Many of us on Wednesday had options purchased weeks or months before, some just a few days earlier that were beautifully profitable --- which by Thursday morning were well on their way to being worthless because of these criminals.

No one denies that FD's and 3DTEs are risky, but it was never on the menu that these guys would change the rules to steal from us like that.

For those of you with those weekly calls over 15 strike. RIP, will never forget this bullshit maneuver. Our fallen comrades, we shall redeem tendies in your name.

Note that BB is NOT a short squeeze, just a popular stock here because the company is on the cusp of going full throttle on its phenomenal decade long turnaround from hardware to software. Trading volume has been huge on green days because we like the stock, but the price rises for a small/mid cap have been at most 30 to 40% and usually far less.

DONT LET THEM SCARE YOU AWAY JUST FOR IT TO SKYROCKET RIGHT AFTER YOU SELL!

It‚Äôs quite obvious hedge funds and shorts are trying to manipulate the market to drive AMC down. Despite their full efforts, AMC and all the memes skyrocketed üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ to the moon üåôüåôüåôüåô today even with robinhood restrictions. 

This shows that we are already stronger than them. The more they try to manipulate, the more I buy and the more I hold.

We have to show them they can‚Äôt fuck around with us like this. We have to show them that we are going to the üåô via AMC sponsored rocket ship üöÄ whether they like it or not.

We will not be weakened by manipulation. We will be strengthened by it and the shorts will be terrified and cry about their rising debts and impending bankruptcies. The retail investors will win this time. The funds will be surprised but we will win. 

So buy. Robinhood tried to scare me. But I switched to schwab and I bought even more, in fact I transferred more money in and bought the dip. Though, This isn‚Äôt about the money anymore. It‚Äôs about the revolution. It‚Äôs about showing the funds who‚Äôs boss. That they can‚Äôt manipulate us into paperhand selling. We will not be manipulated anymore. Retail together can easily destroy funds. Remember this heading into Monday and we will all see unlimited tendies next week. It‚Äôs about free markets we want to make it clear to the funds and big boy media groups that they can‚Äôt just manipulate the market and strike fear into the market with media advertisements to make us sell. They should know once we have decided it‚Äôs going up and that we like the stock, it‚Äôs going to moon.

I am a senior film student at well known university in Connecticut (Ivy League, rhymes with whale). For my senior film thesis I have been documenting the rise of this subreddit. I started back in August when this sub was going all in on Tesla FD's but now things have taken a crazy turn.

Clearly something massive is happening right now and it needs to be properly documented. Years from now some hollywood pansy is going to make this a movie and completely fuck up the real story.

Don't y'all want one of your own telling it? (My positions are 100 shares GME @ 37.50 and 200 shares NOK @ 4.06)

For my project I humbly ask if any of you beautiful retards who have made bank off GME would be willing to let me interview you. Obviously I'd love the whale himself [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) but I'd also want to interview anyone who has made a life changing amount of money (can be any amount as long as it was big for you personally) off GME.

I will of course publish my final project on this subreddit for all to see.

Ok, before I retire to my weekend, I have to let you know why I do believe this battle can be won by us only one way and why there is right now more likelihood short sellers can win. 

You know that the Short interest ratio has not changed much and it is still above 100%. And you also know probably borrowing rate for short sellers is >30% per annum, meaning you short 100$, if you keep it for 1 year, you will pay the lender >30$ in interest.

Ok, we have to remember this! Not the same short-sellers might stay in this game forever. Some get in, they get hurt, they get out, someone else takes the rein, meaning not one single hedge fund will pay >30% rate per annum on fees.  They believe this will blow over very soon 1-2 months max, they will pay 5-6% on that shorted stocks but if GME goes down, they will probably make 50-60 maybe 90%. If GME goes up to 600$ they will short at that price, if it rises to 800$ they will short at that, overall, one day they believe (and that day they believe is not 1 year but few months ahead, they will make a ton of money). Therefore, you see SHort interest has not changed much, some have covered, but others have stepped in, believing that the current price is too high, they can make money at this level. 

 They believe this is a beautiful asymmetric risk and reward trade based on historical short squeezes. take the example of VW. Google it. 

TAKEAWAY and ONLY WAY TO SQUEEZE:  ONLY WAY WE CAN REALLY SQUEEZE THEM OUT IS TO HOLD THIS STOCK FOR MONTHS TO COME, NOT 1 or 2 months but maybe 1 YEAR! The only way to bleed them out is to make sure they are shorted for the long term, they pay borrowing rates, they lose money as the stock goes up, they get out, and also, REMEMBER, every quarter they have to send letters to their CLIENTS explaining how their portfolio did. WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS for FEW QUARTERS so that when their investors see their performance, they will either pull the money out or force them to cover! THIS IS LONG TERM GAME guys. YOU have to hold it even if it passes 1000$! THEY BELIEVE this will be over SOON, they will make a ton of money on their shorts and they will be able to show great returns to their clients. WE HAVE TO HOLD IT! LONG TERM! THIS IS THE ONLY WAY! 

If you don't hold it at least for 1- 2 quarters, the game will be won by the last short sellers.

WE REALLY LIKE THIS STOCK!!!

EDIT: This is my hypothesis that as the stock rises, the appetite to short will grow. One of the reasons is because A lot of you keep saying we will sell at 1000$. WHY are you giving them that precious tip?! They know where most of you will exit. As this approaches to 1000$(diamond fingers crossed), they will keep shorting more.  Remember, this is not TESLA. SHORT interest in Tesla declined when TESLA became hundreds of billions in market cap. GME is still 23bln$ there is more way to go. As the market cap grows, shorters' power declines, and they lose interest. Just like in Tesla.

Edit2: then you might ask what is our exit strategy?Remember what u/Deepfuckingvalue said: ‚Äúwhat is exit strategy?‚Äù  Good night !"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185654.csv|StockTicker|['THE', 'EASON', 'EHIND']|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'VW', 'EAWAY', 'ONLY', 'WAY', 'TO', 'ONLY', 'WAY', 'WE', 'CAN', 'EALLY', 'UEEZE', 'THEM', 'OUT', 'IS', 'TO', 'HOLD', 'THIS', 'STOCK', 'FOR', 'ONTHS', 'TO', 'COME', 'NOT', 'YEAR', 'EMBER', 'IENTS', 'WE', 'HAVE', 'TO', 'KEEP', 'THIS', 'FEW', 'RTERS', 'THIS', 'IS', 'LONG', 'TERM', 'GAME', 'YOU', 'THEY', 'LIEVE', 'SOON', 'WE', 'HAVE', 'TO', 'HOLD', 'IT', 'LONG', 'TERM', 'THIS', 'IS', 'THE', 'ONLY', 'WAY', 'WE', 'EALLY', 'LIKE', 'THIS', 'STOCK', 'A', 'WHY', 'TESLA', 'SHORT', 'TESLA', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Citron said in his video that a squeeze can‚Äôt happen if insiders keep selling, but insiders (likely) CAN NOT sell company issued stock because of end of fiscal quarter lockup/blackout period, which usually extends until earnings are reported (which is on 3/26!!)

TLDR - no insider selling means more üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ fuel because paper handed insiders can‚Äôt give in to the shorts even if they wanted to.

Alright listen up. I did a quick search on WSB and didn‚Äôt see any hits actually talking about what is known as a ‚Äúquiet period‚Äù or ‚Äúblackout‚Äù for corporate stock trades in relation to insiders selling their company issues GME stock.

You NEED to know this to understand one of the big points that Citron made is complete BS in the short term (insiders creating liquidity for shorts).

I‚Äôm assuming that many WSBers have never received stock based compensation and may not know the general corporate governance rules around them that many (most/all?) companies impose on their insiders. Here‚Äôs a quick education in that and a summary of what it (might) mean for GME.

Obligatory disclaimer: I‚Äôm not a financial advisor and I am long GME.

First: what is stock based compensation?

This is exactly what it sounds like, when as part of your comp for being a good employee, you get some sort of stock with some sort of conditions attached. There are many different flavors of this that are important.

options - these give you the right to buy stock at some fixed price, known as a strike price, which may be significantly below than market value (good!). There are many different types of option (eg ISO, NQ), but at the end of the day most are a discount coupon for cheap below market stock values. These are common for preIPO companies. You‚Äôll see these in the world of SPACs, for example, as warrants.

RSU: restricted stock units - these are literally shares, given almost like cash. More common for post IPO companies.

PRSU: performance RSUs - usually tied to some job performance goal, such as hitting a certain amount of revenue or other measurable goal.

Almost all stock based compensation comes with conditions, such as complying with whatever is in the associated company stock/equity plan. These are usually things like time vesting, which simply means that you can‚Äôt take stock and run but rather have to let it vest over a period of months/years.

From the wallst perspective, stock comp is reported as an expense, so you‚Äôll see it in financial disclosures and investor presentations from time to time.

Second: how do companies ensure these incentives don‚Äôt hurt them or other shareholders?

This is critically important. Besides making sure there are clear policies on vesting and such, companies need to make sure that insiders do not use their company granted stock to hurt themselves or other shareholders, by performing trades during times when the employees may have critical information that the public does not. 

This is usually wrapped up in an insider trading policy.

Now, when WSB usually thinks about insider trading, you may think some hot head exec tipping off their golf buddy that the stock is about to crash (or pop) and they should act accordingly. Yes, that‚Äôs insider trading; however, there is a more mundane version which is insiders who might have a general idea if earnings are going to be good or bad and making trades of their own company stock to profit themselves.

To protect against that, companies will often place quiet periods / trading blackouts BEFORE THE END OF A QUARTER, often by weeks at a time, AND EXTEND THAT BLACKOUT THROUGH EARNINGS REPORT DAY.

READ: end of GME quarter is THIS MONTH, meaning it is incredibly likely that all GME issued stock owned by insiders is locked up under the corporate blackout.

This is almost certainly why you don‚Äôt see RC or anyone else from GME saying anything right now, due to quiet period.

In practical terms, GME would likely partner with a trading platform to administer stock grants, such as E*TRADE (which is common). The stock admin at GME would communicate blackout dates to E*TRADE (in this example), and During these dates, all of the sell functions in that stock plan account would be disabled.

READ: GME insiders see their stock plan values going through the roof right now, and CAN NOT SELL because of corporate blackout. This means the shorts can‚Äôt cover with insider liquidity like Citron said.

Since these blackouts usually extend thru earnings, and that is weeks/month away, those shares would be unavailable to bail out the shorts for paper handed insiders.

SUMMARY
Citron said short squeeze can‚Äôt happen when insiders are selling .... Insiders (very likely) can‚Äôt sell because of end of quarter blackout. 

This should be common knowledge for Citron and other shorts. Anyone else on here who has dealt with stock based comp, please do sanity check me here and I‚Äôm happy to edit and refine.

Edit: This is üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ fuel , since this means yet more of the outstanding shares that are inaccessible to cover shorts."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185652.csv|StockTicker|['GME', 'THRU']|['GME']|['CAN', 'NOT', 'TLDR', 'I', 'WSB', 'GME', 'NEED', 'BS', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'ISO', 'IPO', 'IPO', 'WSB', 'EFORE', 'THE', 'END', 'OF', 'A', 'ARTER', 'AND', 'XTEND', 'THAT', 'CKOUT', 'ROUGH', 'NINGS', 'EPORT', 'DAY', 'GME', 'THIS', 'MONTH', 'GME', 'RC', 'GME', 'GME', 'TRADE', 'GME', 'TRADE', 'GME', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'SELL', 'MMARY']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Here's my narrative of what took place this week:

**Melvin Short Squeeze / Bailout**

To understand the genesis of the bailout by Point 72/Citadel, it's important to understand how L/S hedge funds operate.  The customers that these businesses are competing for are their investors (LPs), which consist of pension funds, insurance companies, and family offices, etc.  These LPs have their own portfolio managers who examine their investments periodically and might decide that they should invest in a L/S HF for diversification purposes or some such reason.  The entire L/S strategy competes amongst itself for these LP dollars.  All things being equal, LPs will invest in the funds that have the best historical returns.  This leads to a competitive landscape where L/S funds only need to do better relative to each other, rather than the overall market.

When you game theory this out, it leads to these funds largely mirroring each others plays, while doing things differently only to the extent they think they have an information advantage over their competitors.  This results in certain stocks having large numbers of Funds as their investors, both as longs and shorts.  The term for these companies on Wall Street is ""Hedge Fund Hotels"".  

As Reddit squeezed Gamestop, it increased the amount of money owed on Melvins short, which led them to sell longs in order to de-risk and cover.  Because they sold these long positions, it had a contagion effect on HFs in the same space, who held the same longs and therefore had losses as Melvin's selling pressure began to crush their funds.  Because of this contagion effect, Steven Cohen and Citadel stepped in to bailout Melvin not because he thought it was a good investment, but to prevent an entire hedge fund strategy from imploding.  

Now, it's very important to consider how this $2.7B dollars was likely used by Melvin.  For Melvin to fight Reddit by shorting GME would have been the institutional equivalent of a WSB YOLO, and likely would not have worked.  For them to use the $2.7B to buy stock and cover would have been very difficult, as they would be directionally moving the same way as both Retail and Option Dealers who were trying to delta hedge, which would have spiked the price of the stock much further.

Logically, I think Melvin used the money early this week to buy massive amounts of call options at a range of expiries and strikes.  This would allow them to de-risk their toxic position economically while not continuing to spike the price of the shares as much as buying in the open.  This explains why the short interest of the stock didn't move much for most of this week - the shares were still sold short, but the squeeze wasn't as harmful to Melvin, as their MTM gains on the options could be used as collateral on the short position.  As they exercise options going forward, they can cover their short.

This also explains CNBC's deception when they said Melvin had ""closed the position"".  Notice they don't say ""covered their short"", as that's not true.  It also explains Steven A. Cohen's taunt of a Tweet this week, where he said ""bring it on.""  It was almost as if to say, ""We've bought our options, we're done here.  Do what you want, you fucking Plebes.""  

Understand that if what I'm saying turns out to be the case, Melvin got very special treatment from their Prime Brokers.  A broker would never let you use risky option positions as full collateral against a short to avoid a margin call.  Understand also that if this is true, the bad news is that the squeeze will never be squoze the way Reddit thinks, but the good news is that the stock will enjoy good price support for a while as Melvin exercises their options and sucks up shares to cover the actual short.

We have brokers (mainly Robinhood) limiting buys and it's now well known that they may be having liquidity issues with clearing orders due to volatility. 

If a clearing issue is the reason we can't buy, because your buy may be substantially higher (or lower but we don't talk about that here) within the 2 days it takes to clear...

Next, they'll try to wait us out. The price went sideways today. We all expected the gamma squeeze to start and it never materialized. And that is by design, because now it's a psychological game. Now they want us to see the squeeze fail to materialize, day after day as they extend their positions, in the hopes that we get bored and give up.

You are a credit card company now, and the shorts will have to shell out at least $6 Billion a year to borrow those shares that they can't cover. Everyone just buy a single share, make sure it is not on margin, and the entire float could be tied up indefinitely.

Another reason we like the stock, is because it is a steady and stable revenue stream. This is a sound investment IMO. It's like we are buying bonds that actually pay well.

**EDIT:** A bunch of people asked about how to do this. Every broker is different. I have Ally and [information about it is here.](https://www.ally.com/invest/self-directed-trading/securities-income-program/)

And turning it on for me is as simple as [checking a couple boxes.](https://imgur.com/W6vCLwq)

There are other short sellers. And these stocks, not just GME , but others too, became extremely volatile and on giant volume.

So first there is the issue of liquidated funds that do not have immediate cash.

They hold positions and would have to unwind them to get cash to cover their margin calls.

Melvin Capital I read was down 30% and got bailed out, so they still have assets, just not liquid, no immediately available cash.

Trust me, if they had a gun to their head they'd have immediately available cash, they'd manage.

Second, even after what happened in 2007-2009, financial institutions with systemic risk are not THAT capitalized.

It's not new and never gets solved: in 1987 NYSE specialists had to bed big banks to provide them with more cash or the whole world would collapse.

And I think bureaucrats do not understand how this all works very well. No one does honestly. But bureaucrats are really clueless and under or overreact. Always.

It gets scary for the clearing firms when you have GME making $35 billion volume and going up 400% in 2 days, AMC making $20 billion and gap 300%, higher volumes than Apple and Amazon that are already higher than usual and on 100 times the volatility .

Interactive Broker CEO was the most honest in my eyes and in an interview with CNBC said they halted trading to protect their clients, the clearing houses, the market, and themselves. He said if they had not done it the short squeeze would have kept ""going and going"", so regulators & brokers agreed to stop it all to ""stop the losses"".

Robinhood decided to re-open trading and the CEO pretended he halted trading of the very volatile stocks as routine like ""oh didn't notice anything special was going on"" ü§°.

Webull CEO said in an interview their clearing house told them they could not take trades anymore. I think they use another entity than Robinhood does.

Not sure why Robinhood halted buying (and not selling). There's really the need for an investigation here. I can't tell you what happened because we do not know.

&#x200B;

My 2 cents:

Short sellers are still very strong on this stock, I think they might even have added, I don't know if they are friends with the clearing house but either way they (ch) get stuck in this game, and retail investors are understandably angry at getting blocked like this.

Brokers don't have billions to my knowledge with which they can cover counterparty risk and they have no contractual obligation to do so and I mean they're not santa claus.

My personal opinion is short sellers refusing to liquidate and take the L is the source of all risks and problems (most of it might be options that they can just hold? Not sure how this gets counted in short interest).

Maybe already the counterparty clearing firms got wiped clean, but regardless of this if the price skyrockets further and the bagholding shorts that refuse to close while they can end up being liquidated and margin called, it's truly over for the market. Everyone is going bankrupt, WSB crashed the world.

The counterparty providers risk is real, but I am not their accountant, I do not know how bad things are, and we don't know what actors (if any) are of good faith. It could be (it probably is) shorties refusing to take the L, putting the whole market at risk.

I think they are really worried the price gets to 5000. From the Peterffy ( IBKR ) interview they really expected this. And it might still happen.

Lehman Brothers, James Cordier, Melvin, same story. They get greedy, they refuse to get out, they get rekt.

And sometimes they get an unfair bailout, and are so deluded they actually think they got unlucky when they really messed up.

TLDR: We didn't just screw over some poorly leveraged hedge funds. We put the whole system to the test and almost broke the plumbing."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185710.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['GME', 'GME', 'I', 'THAT', 'NYSE', 'I', 'GME', 'AMC', 'CEO', 'CNBC', 'CEO', 'CEO', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'L', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'L', 'I', 'IBKR']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'IBKR']

The story so far:

So if the GME squeeze actually follows through and we all hold it theoretically could hit like 10k or more per share. The problem with that is it would probably tanking the whole market stupid hard and send the stock market into a recession potentially. Because, virtually those shares could not be paid back. It‚Äôs why Robin Hood was in a panic they didn‚Äôt have enough liquidity. The squeeze is being suppressed for the reason it can‚Äôt be paid out. Essentially, unless other funds bail out the ones that went broke and go broke with them and then have the government or banks bail those guys out that would be the only way. But I‚Äôm doing so all of that would devastate the stock market because all of those hedge funds and bankers will have to liquidate every asset they have. Realistically, it would be like the ‚Äò08 crash but in our favor or anyone holding GME or any other meme stock that flies with it. Because, investment institutions will get drained and all that should go to the people. Hopefully.

The plan:

Now for those who might see this. The idea should be to buy long term put options on either big Tech, or actually virtually anything because of an incoming massive decline. This would destroy the market tho because you couldn‚Äôt have those paid back either, due to if the situation above happens. But wait before you say ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äù. After the stocks of all these companies go to shit unfortunately because of the GME squeeze and put options they should be sent to such a low value that those who do have money can swoop in and absolutely take control of stocks that the rich and manipulative did. We then become the majority shareholders we become the stock market. The rich don‚Äôt control the companies the people control the companies we control what we like and what we want. The retail investors become the stock market.

Tldr; 

The GME squeeze could destroy the market. Buy gay bear puts to make it worse. Then buy back all the stocks of big companies and have the retail investors take over the market.

Turns-out he owns 95% of the Mets. It was really important to him, [he went from owning 8% in 2013 to finally taking over controlling majority in November of 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cohen_(businessman)#New_York_Mets). So that means he's gotten to be majority owner of the Mets for about 90 days. Isn't that nice?

The Mets are worth [$2.4 Billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/194627/mlb-franchise-value-of-the-new-york-mets-since-2006/) (<--there's probably a better way to look this up but this has the basics) making Cohen's piece $2.2. In order to take majority ownership, one would need to purchase 48% of the Mets from Cohen and/or the 5% holder (family that owns the team). 48% of 2.4 =

1.15 billion.

In theory, that would be a fair price (according to my smooth brain math).

So I think we should offer him $500 million *cash* for 48% of the Mets, with the option to buy more if the family turns-over their ownership to Cohen.

$650m less than the smooth-brain value of his stake in the team, but it would be an injection of $500m liquid capital which could help him buy GME shares from us right away.

I don't know how to run a fucking baseball team, doubt any of you do either (wait, maybe dfv...). But we could flip the majority stake to, idk, Jay-Z? Turn a little profit, make a foundation for families that got burned during the 2008 housing crisis and front-line medical workers?

 The options market is what was even more messed up than the GME stock. All options released were becoming ITM. I had never seen this. The options clearing corporation were releasing absurd call strike prices and they were striking. All of them. Let that sink in. 

The Options Clearing Corporation guarantees all of the options made. Go give the investopedia on them a read. They are conveniently doing maintenance tomorrow on their website and data will be down. The Options Clearing Corporation Serves as a central clearinghouse and regulator for listed options traded in the United States under the auspices of the SEC. The SEC was supposed to have oversight of them. 

Lies were told across all major news networks. Interviews were given and headlines tried to push a narrative. 

They painted r/wallstreetbets in a bad light. We are individual people making our own decisions. Taking our own risk. They took our financial freedom away from us on Thursday January 28th 2021. They limited access to buy stocks and drove the options price down to almost exactly max pain on low volume while they locked us out of a ""free""market. 

Today they must have had a plan, limit shares, short ladders,¬† hovered around most of the day and close at 320. Those same news stations all point to Robinhood a company that was soon to IPO at close to 20 Billion dollars. A company that was on a future course to make more in payment orders for stock and options than any other broker. 

Another thing I have never seen is that bid/ask. The market makers were allowed to set it way wider than normal. That is not the issue. Someone needs to investigate why the bid was lowered so much lower almost all day than the ask. I am talking major movement to the bid. 

Also someone needs to look into Jeff Psaki as he was leading the credit component of the strategy at Citadel. Why was this 140% short allowed from one of their brokers?

I heard they treat their customers like shit and care more about boot licking some billionaires dress shoes than providing a quality service to their users.

They also use some pretty sketchy methods to profit off their customers so once that becomes more widely known I don't feel like their user growth will continue any longer.

Also they have an extremely unreliable and low quality service compared to their competitors of which there are hundreds, that provide the same general services with better quality and respect to their customers.

Finally, the company is also facing a couple class actions due to their illegal and sketchy methods of abusing their users.


Personally I would stay away from their IPO if that ever happens now, cuz I don't think the risk of the business surviving in the long term is very high, their customer growth is abysmal, and the lawsuits will definitely put a drain on their capital. Also their CEO looks like he's still a virgin, so how can he run a successful business if he can't even successfully dip his banana?

It‚Äôs a serious concern, and I think there‚Äôs a near 100% possibility that they pull something like this as it‚Äôs their only move to stop people from making money on the squeeze.

There is a lot of debate and misinformation, but everybody is united on one thing: Hedgies deserve the pain we are trying to bring. The common man deserves to play the same game that wall street does.

This is our opportunity to make this a movement. With an appealing website, the threat of the squeeze may strike fear in our enemies. If we works, we get more üíé ü§≤ on our side. If it scares fundies, they cover. Can't go tits up.

#So, listen up webdev nerds. We need a website for normies.

**We need a centralized source of information, status, and FAQs** A reference and guide for everyone that wants to get involved. **One of you autistic basement dwelling nerds please just make this thing. We need it by Monday.**  I'll fucking cashapp you $100 if its good enough to get pinned. (Other retards, feel free to chip in)


It should contain the following:

----

##1. A summary of the situation

Your audience is normal people, not retards. Keep it honest, unopinionated, professional:

Hedge funds overly shorted a stock, and we can make them pay. They put themselves in a vulnerable position, and we have the power to capitalize on it. The fundamentals of the stock are largely irrelevant, but Gamestop is not destined for bankruptcy -- in fact it's future looks bright.  (Lots of links.  gmedd, roaringkitty summary vids, anything you can find)

This section will contain links that are sympathetic to our efforts:

* Tweets by celebrities
* Videos of Chamanth and other immortals defending us
* Videos of that old boomer cooperman saying ""fair shake is bullshit. its just an attack on the rich!""
* Articles about what GME now represents

---

##2: What is short selling?

A description of why hedge funds are vulnerable. They borrowed shares, and must pay interest on what they owe. As the price of the stock goes up, they are incentivized to buy shares back (called ""covering"") so that they do not need to pay interest anymore. Every time they cover, the price will go up, creating a feedback loop. This is a short squeeze.

They borrowed so many shares that we can very easily make it difficult for them to buy shares back. ""Difficult"" means ""expensive"". The profits go to us.

---

##3: Current pain index

A section showing the hedges current pain.  These values will be filled in with current estimates, but the user can alter them as they see fit.

The idea here is to gamify this a little. Show really big a number from 1 to 100, where log($1m/day) = 1, and log($1b/day) = 100, and below it the $/day.

Explain that we collectively push this index higher by buying shares, and not ever selling.

This section also displays how this number is computed: how many shares are estimated to be borrowed and how much interest they are paying.

* Current short interest (in shares) estimates.
* Current borrow amount (short interest x share price)
* Current borrow fee
* Pain:  Daily / Weekly / Month cost to remain short
* Estimated available shares to buy (float minus locked shares.. can be linked to WSB post that estimates this or make your own)

---

##3: FAQS

Real, honest, and transparent with the risk.

**How does a short squeeze work?**  Link to a youtube video with an animation so that any ape could understand it.

**Count me in! How do I buy shares?** Fidelity of Vanguard. Other brokers have previously prevented the purchasing of GME shares. Do not trust the following: (big list of shitty brokers)

**I'm told this is a bubble/speculative/volatile/etc** This is true. This is not for everyone. If you cannot stomach the risk of losing what you put in, then you should sit this one out.

**Will I end up a ""bagholder?""** Unfortunately, it is possible you will not sell for more than you paid. The higher the price is, the more likely this becomes. It is extremely difficult to predict what price is the peak, or when the short squeeze is over and the prices will fall. For that reason, we once again recommend not putting in more than you can afford to lose.

**How high could the peak go?** The amount of GME shares shorted is unprecedented. Additionally, the amount of attention this situation has received is also unprecedented. Therefore, the peak could be unprecedented.  As the supply of shares gets lower (from us buying and holding), the demand gets higher (from the pain index increasing) -- thus the price goes higher. This cycle feeds back on itself until supply and demand balance out.

----------

**tldr: one of you nerds fucking make a friendly non bullshit site with some info that everyone on this sub asks 10000 fucking times a day.

## TL:DR: yes its long. Grab a beer. 

&#x200B;

Until his dying day in 2014, Nelson Bunker Hunt, who had once been the world‚Äôs wealthiest man, denied that he and his brother plotted to corner the global silver market.¬†

Sure, back in 1980, Bunker, his younger brother Herbert, and other members of the Hunt clan owned roughly two-thirds of all the privately held silver on earth. But the historic stockpiling of bullion hadn‚Äôt been a ploy to manipulate the market, they and their sizable legal team would insist in the following years. Instead, it was a strategy to hedge against the voracious inflation of the 1970s‚Äîa monumental bet against the U.S. dollar.

Whatever the motive, it was a bet that went historically sour. The debt-fueled boom and bust of the global silver market not only decimated the Hunt fortune, but threatened to take down the U.S. financial system.¬†

The panic of ‚ÄúSilver Thursday‚Äù took place over 35 years ago, but it still raises questions about the nature of financial manipulation. While many view the Hunt brothers as members of a long succession of white collar crooks, from Charles Ponzi to Bernie Madoff, others see the endearingly eccentric Texans as the victims of overstepping regulators and vindictive insiders who couldn‚Äôt stand the thought of being played by a couple of southern yokels.

In either case, the story of the Hunt brothers just goes to show how difficult it can be to distinguish illegal market manipulation from the old fashioned wheeling and dealing that make our markets work.

**The Real-Life Ewings**

Whatever their foibles, the Hunts make for an interesting cast of characters. Evidently *CBS* thought so; the family is [rumored](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9446483/Dallas-the-feuding-family-that-inspired-the-TV-series.html) to be the basis for the Ewings, the fictional Texas oil dynasty of *Dallas* fame.

Sitting at the top of the family tree was H.L. Hunt, a man who [allegedly](http://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/30/business/the-hunts-a-dynasty-built-on-poker-and-oil.html?pagewanted=all) purchased his first oil field with poker winnings and made a fortune drilling in east Texas. H.L. was a well-known oddball to boot, and his sons inherited many of their father‚Äôs quirks.

For one, there was the stinginess. Despite being the richest man on earth in the 1960s, Bunker Hunt (who went by his middle name), along with his younger brothers Herbert (first name William) and Lamar, cultivated an image as unpretentious good old boys. They drove old Cadillacs, flew coach, and when they eventually went to trial in New York City in 1988, they took the subway. As one Texas editor was quoted in the¬†[*New York Times*](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=19800328&id=2Z5RAAAAIBAJ&sjid=520DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5985,4950668&hl=en), Bunker Hunt was ‚Äúthe kind of guy who orders chicken-fried steak and Jello-O, spills some on his tie, and then goes out and buys all the silver in the world.‚Äù

Cheap suits aside, the Hunts were not without their ostentation. At the end of the 1970s, Bunker boasted a stable of over 500 horses and his little brother Lamar owned the Kansas City Chiefs. All six children of H.L.‚Äôs first marriage (the patriarch of the Hunt family had fifteen children by three women before he died in 1974) lived on estates befitting the scions of a Texas billionaire. These lifestyles were financed by trusts, but also risky investments in oil, real estate, and a host of commodities including sugar beets, soybeans, and, before long, silver.¬†

The Hunt brothers also inherited their father‚Äôs political inclinations. A zealous anti-Communist, Bunker Hunt bankrolled conservative causes and was a prominent member of the John Birch Society, a group whose founder once [speculated](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19610401&id=mxkQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8IoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2507,24704&hl=en) that Dwight Eisenhower was a ‚Äúdedicated, conscious agent‚Äù of Soviet conspiracy. In November of 1963, Hunt sponsored a particularly ill-timed political campaign, which distributed pamphlets around Dallas condemning President Kennedy for alleged slights against the Constitution on the day that he was assassinated. JFK conspiracy theorists have been obsessed with Hunt ever since.¬†

In fact, it was the Hunt brand of politics that partially explains what led Bunker and Herbert to start buying silver in 1973.

**Hard Money**

The 1970s were not kind to the U.S. dollar.

Years of wartime spending and unresponsive monetary policy pushed inflation upward throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. Then, in October of 1973, war broke out in the Middle East and an oil embargo was declared against the United States. Inflation jumped above 10%. It would stay high throughout the decade, peaking in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution at an annual average of 13.5% in 1980.

Over the same period of time, the global monetary system underwent a historic transformation. Since the first Roosevelt administration, the U.S. dollar had been pegged to the value of gold at a predictable rate of $35 per ounce. But in 1971, President Nixon, responding to inflationary pressures, suspended that relationship. For the first time in modern history, the paper dollar did not represent some fixed amount of tangible, precious metal sitting in a vault somewhere.

For conservative commodity traders like the Hunts, who blamed government spending for inflation and held grave reservations about the viability of fiat currency, the perceived stability of precious metal offered a financial safe harbor. It was illegal to trade gold in the early 1970s, so the Hunts turned to the next best thing.

>*Data from the* [*Bureau of Labor Statistics*](http://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet)*; chart by Priceonomics*

As an investment, there was a lot to like about silver. The Hunts were not alone in fleeing to bullion amid all the inflation and geopolitical turbulence, so the price was ticking up. Plus, light-sensitive silver halide is a key component of photographic film. With the growth of the consumer photography market, new production from mines struggled to keep up with demand.

And so, in 1973, Bunker and Herbert bought over 35 million ounces of silver, most of which they flew to Switzerland in specifically designed airplanes guarded by armed Texas ranch hands. According to one [source](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921964,00.html), the Hunt‚Äôs purchases were big enough to move the global market.¬†

But silver was not the Hunts' only speculative venture in the 1970s. Nor was it the only one that got them into trouble with regulators.

**Soy Before Silver**

In 1977, the price of soybeans was rising fast. Trade restrictions on Brazil and growing demand from China made the legume a hot commodity, and both Bunker and Herbert decided to enter the futures market in April of that year.

A future is an agreement to buy or sell some quantity of a commodity at an agreed upon price at a later date. If someone contracts to buy soybeans in the future (they are said to take the ‚Äúlong‚Äù position), they will benefit if the price of soybeans rise, since they have locked in the lower price ahead of time. Likewise, if someone contracts to sell (that‚Äôs called the ‚Äúshort‚Äù position), they benefit if the price falls, since they have locked in the old, higher price.

While futures contracts can be used by soybean farmers and soy milk producers to guard against price swings, most futures are traded by people who wouldn‚Äôt necessarily know tofu from cream cheese. As a *de facto* insurance contract against market volatility, futures can be used to hedge other investments or simply to gamble on prices going up (by going long) or down (by going short).

When the Hunts decided to go long in the soybean futures market, they went very, very long. Between Bunker, Herbert, and the accounts of five of their children, the Hunts collectively purchased the right to buy one-third of the entire autumn soybean harvest of the United States.

To some, it appeared as if the Hunts were attempting to corner the soybean market.

In its simplest version, a corner occurs when someone buys up all (or at least, most) of the available quantity of a commodity. This creates an artificial shortage, which drives up the price, and allows the market manipulator to sell some of his stockpile at a higher profit.

Futures markets introduce some additional complexity to the cornerer‚Äôs scheme. Recall that when a trader takes a short position on a contract, he or she is pledging to sell a certain amount of product to the holder of the long position. But if the holder of the long position just so happens to be sitting on all the readily available supply of the commodity under contract, the short seller faces an unenviable choice: go scrounge up some of the very scarce product in order to ‚Äúmake delivery‚Äù or just pay the cornerer a hefty premium and nullify the deal entirely.

In this case, the cornerer is actually counting on the shorts to do the latter, says Craig Pirrong, professor of finance at the University of Houston. If too many short sellers find that it actually costs less to deliver the product, the market manipulator will be stuck with warehouses full of inventory. Finance experts refer to selling the all the excess supply after building a corner as ‚Äúburying the corpse.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is when the price collapses,‚Äù explains Pirrong. ‚ÄúBut if the number of deliveries isn‚Äôt too high, the loss from selling at the low price after the corner is smaller than the profit from selling contracts at the high price.‚Äù

Even so, when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission found that a single family from Texas had contracted to buy a sizable portion of the 1977 soybean crop, they did not accuse the Hunts of outright market manipulation. Instead, noting that the Hunts had exceeded the 3 million bushel aggregate limit on soybean holdings by about 20 million, the CFTC [noted](http://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/29/archives/new-jersey-pages-us-fights-effort-by-the-hunts-to-corner-the.html?_r=0) that the Hunt‚Äôs ‚Äúexcessive holdings threaten disruption of the market and could cause serious injury to the American public.‚Äù The CFTC ordered the Hunts to sell and to pay a penalty of $500,000.

Though the Hunts made tens of millions of dollars on paper while soybean prices skyrocketed, it‚Äôs unclear whether they were able to cash out before the regulatory intervention. In any case, the Hunts were none too pleased with the decision.¬†

‚ÄúApparently the CFTC is trying to repeal the law of supply and demand,‚Äù Bunker complained to the¬†[press](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1977/04/29/hunts-ordered-to-defer-acceptance-of-soybeans/1db5c239-92e9-4859-8a6b-12d94cee68f3/).

**Silver Thursday**

Despite the run in with regulators, the Hunts were not dissuaded. Bunker and Herbert had eased up on silver after their initial big buy in 1973, but in the fall of 1979, they were back with a vengeance. By the end of the year, Bunker and Herbert owned 21 million ounces of physical silver each. They had even larger positions in the silver futures market: Bunker was long on 45 million ounces, while Herbert held contracts for 20 million. Their little brother Lamar also had a more ‚Äúmodest‚Äù position.

By the new year, with every dollar increase in the price of silver, the Hunts were making $100 million on paper. But unlike most investors, when their profitable futures contracts expired, they took delivery. As in 1973, they arranged to have the metal flown to Switzerland. Intentional or not, this helped create a shortage of the metal for industrial supply.

Naturally, the industrialists were unhappy. From a spot price of around $6 per ounce in early 1979, the price of silver shot up to $50.42 in January of 1980. In the same week, silver futures contracts were trading at $46.80. Film companies like Kodak saw costs go through the roof, while the British film producer, Ilford, was forced to lay off workers. Traditional bullion dealers, caught in a squeeze, cried foul to the commodity exchanges, and the New York jewelry house Tiffany & Co. took out a full page ad in the *New York Times* slamming the ‚Äúunconscionable‚Äù Hunt brothers. They were right to single out the Hunts; in mid-January, they controlled 69% of all the silver futures contracts on the Commodity Exchange (COMEX) in New York.

üì∑

>*Source:*¬†[*New York Times*](http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1980/03/26/112147201.html?zoom=15)

But as the high prices persisted, new silver began to come out of the woodwork. ¬†¬†

‚ÄúIn the U.S., people rifled their dresser drawers and sofa cushions to find dimes and quarters with silver content and had them melted down,‚Äù says Pirrong, from the University of Houston. ‚ÄúSilver is a classic part of a bride‚Äôs trousseau in India, and when prices got high, women sold silver out of their trousseaus.‚Äù

According to a¬†[*Washington Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/03/27/police-charge-southwest-man-with-burglaries-in-3-areas/edfb54d6-52e8-446a-8ce5-2cab5b7578bc/) article published that March, the D.C. police warned residents of a rash of home burglaries targeting silver.¬†

Unfortunately for the Hunts, all this new supply had a predictable effect. Rather than close out their contracts, short sellers suddenly found it was easier to get their hands on new supplies of silver and deliver.

‚ÄúThe main factor that has caused corners to fail \[throughout history\] is that the manipulator has underestimated how much will be delivered to him if he succeeds \[at\] raising the price to artificial levels,‚Äù says Pirrong. ‚ÄúEventually, the Hunts ran out of money to pay for all the silver that was thrown at them.‚Äù

In financial terms, the brothers had a large corpse on their hands‚Äîand no way to bury it.

This proved to be an especially big problem, because it wasn‚Äôt just the Hunt fortune that was on the line. Of the $6.6 billion worth of silver the Hunts held at the top of the market, the brothers had ‚Äúonly‚Äù spent a little over $1 billion of their own money. The rest was borrowed from over 20 banks and brokerage houses.

At the same time, COMEX decided to crack down. On January 7, 1980, the exchange‚Äôs board of governors announced that it would cap the size of silver futures exposure to 3 million ounces. Those in excess of the cap (say, by the tens of millions) were given until the following month to bring themselves into compliance. But that was too long for the Chicago Board of Trade exchange, which suspended the issue of *any* new silver futures on January 21. Silver futures traders would only be allowed to square up old contracts.

Predictably, silver prices began to slide. As the various banks and other firms that had backed the Hunt bullion binge began to recognize the tenuousness of their financial position, they issued margin calls, asking the brothers to put up more money as collateral for their debts. The Hunts, unable to sell silver lest they trigger a panic, borrowed even more. By early March, futures contracts had fallen to the mid-$30 range.

Matters finally came to a head on March 25, when one of the Hunts‚Äô largest backers, the Bache Group, asked for $100 million more in collateral. The brothers were out of cash, and Bache was unwilling to accept silver in its place, as it had been doing throughout the month. With the Hunts in default, Bache did the only thing it could to start recouping its losses: it start to unload silver.

On March 27, ‚ÄúSilver Thursday,‚Äù the silver futures market dropped by a third to $10.80. Just two months earlier, these contracts had been trading at four times that amount.

**The Aftermath**

After the oil bust of the early 1980s and a series of lawsuits polished off the remainder of the Hunt brothers‚Äô once historic fortune, the two declared bankruptcy in 1988. Bunker, who had been worth an estimated $16 billion in the 1960s, emerged with under $10 million to his name. That‚Äôs not exactly chump change, but it wasn‚Äôt enough to maintain his 500-plus stable of horses,.

The Hunts almost dragged their lenders into bankruptcy too‚Äîand with them, a sizable chunk of the U.S. financial system. Over twenty financial institutions had extended over a billion dollars in credit to the Hunt brothers. The default and resulting collapse of silver prices blew holes in balance sheets across Wall Street. A privately orchestrated bailout loan from a number of banks allowed the brothers to start paying off their debts and keep their creditors afloat, but the markets and regulators were rattled.

>*Source:* [*Trading Economics*](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/commodity/silver)

In the words of then CFTC chief James Stone, the Hunts‚Äô antics had threatened to punch a hole in the ‚Äúfinancial fabric of the United States‚Äù like nothing had in decades. Writing about the entire episode a year later, [*Harper‚Äôs Magazine*](http://harpers.org/archive/1981/05/silver-thursday/) described Silver Thursday as ‚Äúthe first great panic since October 1929.‚Äù

The trouble was not over for the Hunts. In the following years, the brothers were dragged before Congressional hearings, got into a legal spat with their lenders, and were sued by a Peruvian mineral marketing company, which had suffered big losses in the crash. In 1988, a New York City jury found for the South American firm, levying a penalty of over $130 million against the Hunts and finding that they had deliberately conspired to corner the silver market.

Surprisingly, there is still some disagreement on that point.

Bunker Hunt attributed the whole affair to the political motives of COMEX insiders and regulators. Referring to himself [later](https://books.google.com/books?id=UiwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA185&lpg=PA185&dq=bunker+hunt+favorite+whipping+boy,&source=bl&ots=_35ozQB6E2&sig=VPGUSMSzx3rqvCISdwjLVqtB7-I&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiVjM31tKjOAhUNyWMKHWKdDScQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&q=bunker%20hunt%20favorite%20whipping%20boy%2C&f=false) as ‚Äúa favorite whipping boy‚Äù of an eastern financial establishment riddled with liberals and socialists, Bunker and his brother, Herbert, are still perceived as martyrs by some on the far-right.¬†

‚ÄúPolitical and financial insiders repeatedly changed the rules of the game,‚Äù wrote the [*New American*](http://www.thenewamerican.com/culture/biography/item/19360-nelson-bunker-hunt-r-i-p-the-myth-of-the-hunt-brothers-scheme-to-corner-the-silver-market). ‚ÄúThere is little evidence to support the ‚Äòcorner the market‚Äô narrative.‚Äù

Though the Hunt brothers clearly amassed a staggering amount of silver and silver derivatives at the end of the 1970s, it is impossible to prove definitively that market manipulation was in their hearts. Maybe, as the Hunts always claimed, they just *really* believed in the enduring value of silver.

Or maybe, as others have noted, the Hunt brothers had no idea what they were doing. Call it the stupidity defense.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre terribly unsophisticated,‚Äù an anonymous associated was quoted as saying of the Hunts in a¬†[*Chicago Tribune*](http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1980/05/18/page/113/article/the-brothers-hunt-they-buy-right-and-sell-wrong-like-ordinary-folk) article from 1989. ‚ÄúThey make all the mistakes most other people make,‚Äù said another.

I have been following everything that's been going on just as many have (hard not to) and hell, even went all in and bought a share of GME and a call for $AMC myself (both at peak prices, $375 GMA, $1,250 AMC $9 2/5). 
Now, alot of people have been brought together throughout all of this. This has been the start of something HUGE, legen.....dary and bigger than all of us.

After today, hitting our target prices for $GME and $AMC, I am curious about what the endgame is? I know this has got to end at somepoint somewhere and there will most likely be bagholders at the end of all this..a lot of people are going to be hurting, in a time where people are already really hurting. So what side will prevail? Will some retailers, people like you and me, be holding in the end? Or will these shorters have to take the L and just eat it all? 

For awhile everyone here were made out to be unknowledgable kids who are just gambling and don't understand the risks by the media, and will need to understand when it's time to pay up its time to pay up..In my opinion however, these hedges that shorted got caught with there pants down..they knew the risks and thought it could never happen. So much so they shorted over 100%. And now the tides against them, drowning them. Shouldn't they be the ones to take the L and pay up?

What if GME offered an obscene amount of shares knowing that they wouldn't all be bought and only bought as a worst case scenario for the hedge funds?

What if they did a cap raise of 50 million shares all at a price of lets say $1000?

If hedge funds are forced to cover, that's their out.  Or for fun, we could do it at 2000.  Or, a range of prices.  The first million shares at 1000, the next at 1100, etc.

All current holders, Ryan Cohen, board members, etc would get diluted.  But, they would be getting diluted and the value of their shares would increase due to the raise being higher than the current stock price.

EXAMPLE. 50m shares at 300 are available right now.  They share 50m more at 1000 each.

Each share gets diluted by half, but each of the current shares gain 500 dollars of value.

Essentially, by selling the shares at 1000 each, current share value goes up to $650.

I don't know what I'm talking about, if what I'm suggesting is stupid, say so.  Or, get this to the top of wsb as a worst case trigger to pull.

Shares outstanding 69.75 million. But we care about the float so 46.89M Lets call it 47 because math is hard
[Yahoo Data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/)

Current interest rate says 32.8%. Again 33 is close enough
[Rick Roll](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)


So for hedge funds that are short what would it take to cover? Pretty simple from the yahoo data 47M shares in the float * 1.1% short = 51.7M shares shorted * 313 our current stock price = 16.182B $ lets call it 16.2B to cover all the outstanding shorts


    $16,200,000,000 to cover all outstanding short positions based on current stock price


On the other side how much is this costing the shorts in total per day? 
For each share: 313 * .33 = 103.3 $ per year per share / 365 = .283 $ per day/share * 51.7M = 14,630,000 a day
Or since rounding might screw us and lazy (313 * 51,700,000 * .33) / 365 = 14,630,000. Hooray it doesn‚Äôt


    $14,630,000 being spent per day on interest payments


This seems to leave them with a choice. 
Wait it out because it will take 3 years to pay the same amount of interest that it would be to cover today while scalping shares along the way to slowly recover their position. In the meantime probably some intensive lobbying to see if they can change the rules to make being retarded illegal.

Or cover, which based on what we have seen seems to scare the shit out of them. 


Tl;dr What does all this mean? Fuck if I know, I would bet they are going to try their hardest to wait this out and let it blow over and play whatever dirty tricks possible to keep from being forced to cover and send us to the moon. Either way best way to get #2 to happen is to HOLD YOUR DAMN SHARES AND DONT LET THEM SLOWLY RECOVER. 

Im letting my shares ride, im either going to be a whaler on the moon or im back to 0.

Something about financial advice, but this is just math, do whatever the hell you want with your own damn money

Edit: Formatting sucks

Edit 2: This is for a snapshot in time right now, not indicative of what could happen in the future, just something to keep in mind. if (or when) the price goes up or volatility goes up, interest rates go with it. Check out the Iborrow link to see past interest rates hit as high as 82.9%

Edit 3: I still 100% believe we will hit the short squeeze, once we get below 100% short float and the market can actually handle it.

Since everyone is in a state of euphoria (or shitting themselves like Vlad), we would start to neglect otherwise important variables that are part of the big picture.

For example, are there any rules in place for these funds, not just the shorts but also the funds that are actually causing the price action of all these tickers yet allowing this sub to get blamed for the market movement, from riding the hype wave up and selling at intervals in order to finally do their job and hedge?

The sub has yet to create a megathread of the proof of conflicts of interest, corruption, suppression, and manipulation. Everything needs to be documented, so having everything in a megathread (also create copies in case of BS) will be helpful in the lawsuits and probes to come. From Citadel having former SEC members working for them to the short laddering techniques to the restriction of buying but not selling on Robinhood, ALL of this needs to gain exposure.

I am not a financial services advisor.   This is just my opinion.  I do not work for these companies.  This is not an ad.

Pick any one of these:

* Fidelity
* Charles Schwab
* Vanguard
* TD Ameritrade
* WeBull(for you autists who love fingering your phones all day)
* E Trade
* SoFi(Chamath's firm)

Of those, Fidelity and Vanguard are possibly the best for mutual funds, research, etc.  Yeah I said mutual funds - the boomer stuff.  Fidelity also has a high quality technical desktop trading app, and a good iOS/Android experience.   So does TD Ameritrade.  The rest - don't know, but probably good.

They have very low management fees for their funds.  And of course, offer options trading as well.  One stop shop for your grandma's 401k, dad's Apple stock purchases, and your pants on head stupid calls.

Godspeed. And hold your GME stock.

Edit: Many good suggestions already for brokers big and small.   This list isn't all inclusive, just a few options.

Antifraud Rule [Securities] Law and Legal Definition

Antifraud Rule is one of the most important rules promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that prohibits deceptive or manipulative practices like material misrepresentations or omissions in the buying or selling of securities. The rule codified at 17 CFR 240.10b-5 says:


¬ß 240.10b-5 Employment of manipulative and deceptive devices.


It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,


(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,


(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or


(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,
in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.

Just spreading your gospel. We all need to see this. 

BEWARE WEEKEND SCARE TACTICS

We made it through the battle today and are UP 69% (nice). The hedges are only getting more desperate after the put options that expired today but REMEMBER: they have at LEAST 2-6 days in the market to pay these off, and likely have MANY MORE options expiring in coming weeks. With the lack of shenanigans today I predict an extended-hours ladder attack is incoming when many retail traders are sidelined from the action, combined with another media push of scare tactics incoming this weekend. We were caught off guard with the RH bullshit but hopefully enough people can get set up with Fidelity next week to even the playing field. But above all else: fuckin hold and we're golden

DON'T TRUST EXTENDED HOURS PRICES TODAY OR MONDAY MORNING.

 DON'T TRUST ANY MEDIA HITPIECES CLAIMING THE SQUEEZE IS OVER THIS WEEKEND.

I have been thinking about Melvin's exit strategy here and what possible ideas they could have to get themselves out of the fucking mess they have got themselves in.   


Everyday I have been checking [short volume](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme) and if my brain isn't completely smooth I believe that means the number of NEW shares being sold short in a given day, not counting any that have been closed.   


Now when we had that jump from 20-30 the short volume was like 33% of the total volume which to me is just mind blowing that these people are STILL trying to short a stock with short interest already over 100%.  


I guess for  üêª just like we want to see who can get the highest limit order filled they all want to short ATH and try cover their other losses for shorting at lower prices.   


**WHERE THE FUCK AM I GOING WITH ALL OF THIS?**

**Bear thesis:** Melvin is going to take advantage of Robinhood & co's fuckery to raise the stock price every day before open and short it down during the day. Because we don't have a large portion of people able to buy the volume has obviously been very low the last couple days compared to what it should have been. Eventually Melvin hopes public sentiment fades in the next week and people begin to fear a drop and everyone sells off and they go home licking their wounds but not broke.   


**Bull thesis:** Assuming Citadel/Melvin had a hand in the disgusting shit these brokers are doing they have only made things worse for themselves if people üíéü§≤ . I am guessing a lot of people will be transferring their shares to other brokers that allows them to add to their position and thanks to Citadels retarded move ALL the shares that are being transferred lower the float even further. So as long as those of us who can still buy keep buying and dont fucking sell then Melvin has really fucked it. They could simply be delaying the inevitable and we have seen this stock go up as much as 100% in a day multiple times in the last couple weeks so once reinforcements come in then that might be the final dildo up their ass.  


All of this is speculation and I am retarded so please correct why I am probably wrong because scrolling through this sub all day isn't enough confirmation bias apparently.

We must continue to fight and hold the line. We have been able to show Wall Street that any retail investor, no matter the amount of tendies they may have - cannot be ignored anymore if we stand ***united***.

***Second: this is my Personal Opinion, and I am not a financial advisor in any aspect (just a fellow autist) but this is what I believe Wall Street will do to try and divide us, and this is my thought process on how they will do it:***

This small little problem of theirs has grown to a point where the entire world of retail traders has banded together to create an army. They are scared shitless of what the market could develop into and what may happen next. We are flipping their financial models and theories upside down, throwing their predatory algorithms into dislocation, and most of all driven a giant spotlight into their practices and now they are in a very uncomfortable position and will do anything in their power to go back to the way things were.

**Distraction**: They don‚Äôt want gamestop or their manipulative practices to be the center of attention anymore so they need to put a bigger story out in front of people‚Äôs faces. I believe they will band together and dump the equity markets in the coming weeks, and at such a fast rate that it becomes the new focus of attention.

***Why would they do this***? Well if the problem can‚Äôt be fixed - then fuck it all - break it. Use the destabilization of the current markets to try and force weak hands for whoever is holding GME to sell, and at the same time profit from everyone else‚Äôs losses on every other stock.

**This sets up a beautiful scenario/narrative for them:**

1. To make it look like a well thought out short thesis instead of what it actually is *(a manipulative coordinated attack against us)*, they will use WSB and gamestop as an excuse to try and draw attention to the fact that the market is overpriced and has been for sometime to justify the price drop. They‚Äôll incite fear and all the other tactics we‚Äôve seen over and over again ***(we see you CNBC).***
2. They will use this to accelerate the market tanking and severely drawdown our purchasing power by decreasing the prices of all of our other holdings so our margin requirements become tighter and try to shake us out of our GME positions.
3. If they are successful *(and they will try everything to make sure we are not)* when the dust settles, they will then blame us for what happened to the markets. They will say how inexperienced we are and then the media will double down their efforts and show stories of retail investors who lost their life‚Äôs savings and had no idea what they were doing etc. ***(which btw, fuck them because they don‚Äôt get that even if we lose money in the market this group teaches more incredible things about market dynamics and is a better use of tuition money than half the universities teaching bullshit financial concepts for 50k a year).***
4. Finally, they will use all of this to put the regulators back in their court and create new policy to box us out even further while saying it‚Äôs only to protect us.

**tldr;** *United we stand, divided we fall* ***-*** I could be completely wrong but either way - **hold that mother fucking line team.**

***Take a look***\*: With these record volume numbers in options and stocks, its easier to bury some of the data so it doesn‚Äôt seem completely abnormal. I chose the QQQ as a reference for the picture below because it‚Äôs more volatile but all the major indices have similar data and you can look for yourself. Below is a photo of the 20 largest options transactions that took place today to close out the week with the amount and expiration dates.\*

Pls correct me if im tardly wrong.

Thanks so much for this let me add my retard maths:
If it cost $14.63 mil in daily interest to sustain shorts at $313 a share

Then the $2.75 billion by Citadel can cover interest (assuming it covers for all shorts) for 187.96 days - rounded 187 days.

Of course since bitch Melvin gets 2.75bil  his total coverage assume as 15% of total short so his interest is 15% of $14.63 mil = $2.19 mil

So with $2.75 bil, Melvin can ride out interest in 1,255 days assuming stock stays $313.

However no investor wants his money to bleed ü©∏ like that time of month, so i assume 1/3 will be used for Melvin to hold at $313 so that is 418 days

We do not know capital infusion other shorts have. So worst case assume they can hold for around 2/3 of a year at $313 (2/3 cost not every short has baby daddy citadel to balls deep $2.75bil)

What next? Buy to raise price and hold to maintain pressure on shorts interest and lock their capital. That will likely make them give up and cover, resulting in price ‚¨ÜÔ∏è.

But if large amount is sold, opposite will happen, due to large short interest the stock price will fall and fall and meet the shorts expectations.

Summary this is a stranglehold between long and righteous holders like us and short mofos. Only one will get out alive.

I hold 3 shares and love this stock.

&#x200B;

Alright, I hate to say it, but there is some less-than-ideal information circulating out there, particularly about the famed ""gamma squeeze"" we hear so much about these days. I'll get to that. Let's go through the questions you simpletons want to know, as explained by a mouth-breathing fool who has managed to convince you he knows what he's talking about:

# Did we win today? Is it endgame?

Kind of. Be patient.

# In what ways did we win?

First, there was the obvious victory of bouncing back 65% today after the worst market manipulation I've ever witnessed. We kept the upward momentum going.

Secondly, every day you finish higher is another day the shorts are underwater. If you are perpetually going up, the walls are closing in on them.

Finally, a lot of put options expired worthless today while a number of call options expired in-the-money. It's always good to make put holders lose money because you drain the bank accounts of people betting against you.

# Yes! Call options! We finished above $320 and get a gamma squeeze to infinity now, right?

No. That's not how this works. Too many people don't quite understand what a gamma squeeze is.

A gamma squeeze happens when call option sellers (or ""writers"") have to hedge their naked calls by buying stocks. They do this because the risk of selling naked calls is theoretically infinite if they don't. It's called delta hedging. You don't need to know all the fancy math (""delta"" and ""gamma"" are those greek symbols for nerds), just understand this: as it becomes more probable that the call option you sold will cost you money, you hedge more.

This is a continuous PROCESS, not a discreet moment in time. The market makers and hedge funds and institutions selling you calls don't wake up on Friday morning and think, ""Shit! I think I'm going to lose everything if these stocks keep going up! I have to BUY NOW!!!"" That would be stupid. They are hedging all the way up. I guarantee you that most of the calls that were exercised at $320 today were already covered. They already went out and bought those shares and most of the upwards pressure that places on the market is priced in already.

# So, no gamma squeeze?

Probably not significantly. They're not going to be madly rushing out on Monday to buy shit they already own for the most part.

# Why are people talking about a gamma squeeze at $320, then?

We did have a gamma squeeze at $320. On Wednesday, two days ago. The price exceeded $320 (then the highest strike price on the books) and promptly surged to $371 before coming back down to around $320. That's what a gamma squeeze is: a frenzied rush by call sellers to cover calls.

It typically happens BEFORE expiration, not after. It's rare for market makers to get so caught with their pants down that they have to get squeezed for the previous week's calls on a Monday. I don't know where this idea of a gamma squeeze now at $320 is coming from.

# This hurts my feelings. So, what's so great about the $320 threshold, anyway? Did it matter at all?

It's still a good thing. There may have been a few lingering naked calls to cover. And, like I said, it's always good to make put-holders lose money because stick it to the üåàüêª, that's why.

$320 was a significant level because there were quite a few open call options at that strike. You can see the entire option chain here: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain)

Go through and count up all the January 29th options that were in-the-money at today's close. I think maybe 90,000 or something? Screw it, I didn't count. Somebody who can figure out how to use a calculator can add those up. Multiply that number by 100 (because option contracts are sold in groups of 100) and that's how many shares need to change hands thanks to contracts expiring ITM.

It may be that with so many shares needing to change hands and so little liquidity in this market, some weird things could happen.

# What weird things?

Well, if nothing else, a lot of shares will need to be tied up as the process of settling calls plays out.

You have to remember that when somebody says they own shares, they don't necessarily *own* own the shares right at that moment.

When you press ""buy"" on your phone and it says your order was filled, that doesn't mean that the process happens instantaneously. For all intents and purposes as far as you are concerned, sure, the process looks instant. However, there's a lot of messy stuff that happens on the back-end of the system between the brokers and the clearing houses. The clearing houses are where the daily tab gets settled: who owes whom and what they owe and at what price, etc.

Monday could be interesting as this tab for millions of stocks (in a market with only 50-something million shares actively circulating) gets settled. It might not be crazy, but it could. We'll see.

Michael Burry (Christian Bale, for all you noobs) seems to think that all the naked short-selling above the float will result in a shit-storm when people actually go to get their shares back: [https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1355221824661983233](https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1355221824661983233)

Liquidity crunch + lots of shares being moved around + nobody knows where they all are currently = potential nightmare for Wall Street.

# I just want my infinite short squeeze and my tendies, so how do we get the MOASS?

Something needs to be the catalyst. Something needs to get the short sellers really underwater, so much so that they are drowning. That's why there's been so much hype about gamma squeezes; the gamma and short squeezes are two separate things, but the gamma squeezing has been really good to us lately. It has triggered some crazy upwards price movements. I still think one was about to happen yesterday morning that would have triggered the squeeze-pocalypse, the Mother of All Short Squeezes. The bastards at the brokerages (acting with and for the clearing houses), took your tendies. It's criminal what played out.

I actually think a gamma squeeze was possible today, as well, as the price shot up to $378 around noon. If it had gotten to $400, it stood a very good chance of running up to $500, which would have caused a run up to $650 and beyond. Then Robinhood said, ""Oh, actually, you plebs cannot buy 5 shares anymore, only 2 now."" The price came back down again.

Oddly enough, the S&P500 sold off over a full percentage point (that's a lot of money) right after GME hit that $378 peak. Do you think this doesn't freak the finance world out? They know a gamma squeeze is like the fuse on a firework. It consumes itself until it ignites the rocket.

# How will Wall Street defend themselves?

They will try to keep snipping the fuse. That's what all these restrictions on brokerages are about. They are trying to defuse the situation slowly because having it all get sorted out quickly and frantically is no good for them.

We need enough upwards price momentum that those option chains keep going up and up and feeding on themselves. They need to become a self-sustaining chain reaction, fed by hedging pressure. And you need to put pressure on your elected representatives to tell them that Wall Street cannot be allowed to just shut down the game when they are losing. I hate to tell you this, but the squeeze has so far been stopped purely by the losers declaring that it will not happen at any cost. It's bullshit. Eat the rich. But there it is.

# Do you feel you've used the word ""squeeze"" too much by now?

Yes. I've been writing and looking at the word ""squeeze"" so much that it is starting to lose its meaning. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeeeeeze.

Aside from media and billionaires freaking out, which gives me confidence that this is real, let's take a look at some other examples.

At the beginning of this week, we were looking at volumes close to 150-200M. That volume obviously took a hit yesterday when many brokers decided to stop allowing purchases, but even today, the trading volume was relatively low. Additionally, the stock price has continued to increase all of these days indicating that there are more shares BOUGHT than sold. The price is around $315 and most people STILL aren't selling, indicated by the low volume today (Friday). That means this price will likely hold as a baseline since we keep taking more shares away from the float and are holding onto it.

This has become a movement though, and more and more people are willing to purchase a ticket to stick it to wall street. You think fewer people are going to get involved...hell no! More people want in on this, with those from Canada, Australia, UK, Germany, and across the world getting in on this. If people keep buying more shares and holding, there will be fewer shares available for trading and we'll likely see even less volume in the days ahead. How do we know they'll hold...well most of those getting in now are doing so to stick it to wall street so they don't mind losing some money if it comes to it. Most importantly, this means THEY WILL HOLD! Plus, a smaller accessible float means the price will rise or at least stay stable, neither of which is sustainable for hedge funds. This does NOT end well for them in any way.

The squeeze may not happen immediately, but as the number of available shares decreases, the probability for an imminent squeeze gets better since the hedge funds will be margin called and have to buy to cover. In fact, the longer this goes on, the more epic the squeeze becomes at this point. They're still short >100% and the number of float available becomes less and less everyday as more people buy and HOLD. Its really only a matter of time...so keep the faith!"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185643.csv|StockTicker|['EALLY', 'GOOD', 'SPOT']|[]|['LOT', 'GME', 'M', 'OUGHT', 'STILL', 'UK', 'THEY', 'WILL', 'HOLD', 'NOT', 'HOLD']|['GME']

However, the actual situation between the two companies could not be more different. GME was never really at risk of bankruptcy. GME always had more cash than debt and was paying back debts ahead of schedule, because it has a flexible business model where it can easily close down underperforming stores, which GME did in large numbers this past year. In place of the underperforming stores, GME is expanding furiously into e-commerce. With RC now at the helm strategically, its future is bright.

AMC is in the exact opposite situation. It operates theaters, which it cannot close down without permanent, serious consequences. There is very little room for AMC to cut operating losses during the pandemic. There is no e-commerce pivot. It has theaters, and that's it. For a while now, AMC has been teetering on the edge of a cliff, facing a massive debt load and mounting operating losses, while hedge funds were relentlessly building short interest on its stock like a flock of locusts. AMC had been just a step away from Chapter 11 several times. The shorts almost won.

****This is where we come in.****

The recent rise in AMC's stock price is not just a middle finger to the short interest hedge funds. It is a lifeline to the **real world** operations of AMC. A few days back, one of AMC's debt holders [converted $600 million worth of debt into stock](https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-silver-lake-swaps-debt-for-equity-as-cinema-chains-stock-surged-1234682417/), and there were additional share offerings and other debt conversions.

>It an SEC filing this morning, AMC said it will be issuing around 44.4 million shares of Class A common stock to Silver Lake and related noteholders in the transaction, which will reduce its debt by $600 million.

>Earlier this month, AMC stockholder Mudrick Capital Management also swapped AMC debt for equity, in this case 14 million shares, plus another 8 million as a fee for separate loan.

>As part of its recently announced fundraising, AMC yesterday finished issuing a further $300 million of equity at $4.80 a share.

>It‚Äôs been a wild ride for the nation‚Äôs largest exhibitor but CEO Adam Aron told Deadline Monday that the chain should have cash enough to ride out the year.

Now, a valid concern might be that the additional stock offerings will increase float and ease the pressure on the shorts. But that didn't happen! The good news aspect of these moves significantly outweighs the additional float. With the freedom to raise capital and reduce debt load, the threat of bankruptcy is all but gone. The shorts will not win anymore, it's just a matter of how much they lose. 

This movement is legitimately saving a real American company. This is not patriotic jingoism. AMC, by the nature of its business, employs US residents and supports local economies across the entire country. AMC is a huge corporation but at the same time extremely local and intimate. The vast majority of its screens are in the US, with a solid representation in Europe as well. Yeah, the popcorn is overpriced, but at least it's going into the pockets of US residents and circulating in the local economy. 

And the enemy? Bloodsucking vampire hedge funds who literally produce NOTHING and do NOTHING except amass capital through underhanded and despicable means. 

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to smash those hedge funds and save a beloved company at the same time.

Over the last couple days of fuckery, it's entirely possible the shorts have managed to close out of their very lowest postions and re-entered new ones higher up. It's possible original shorts have abandoned the game, but new players have entered. We have no way of knowing the position of the short, just that there is one. It's possible certain places have covered their shorts. But that doesn't matter. Don't let that get in your head.

What matters is the short interest %, and by any account, that has either flatlined, gone down only the slightest amount, or even gotten larger. That is the key. They haven't backed down. Maybe shuffled the chairs on the deck of the titanic, but still steering straight for the iceberg. 

I'll use Tesla as an example. You know how shorts lost billions against them? Well, it wasn't because of a short squeeze, it's because people kept buying and holding and buying and shorts kept leapfrogging their positions thinking it *had* to go down. It hasn't. What we've seen the past two weeks is simply two years of the Tesla battle vs shorts played out in fast forward. 

It's simple math at this point. Regardless of current price or point where they entered their position, shorts have to pay interest. It costs nothing to hold. 

It might not be a violent squeeze like VW 2008, but until those fuckers back off trying to short this to excess levels and the short interest % comes down, it's a steady march to five digits."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185652.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['VW']|[]

Just like Tesla that almost went under, it got an almost cult-like following, people are rooting for it to win against the big guys, and succeeding at that. 

Both are about something that the boomers in suits don't understand so they try to shut it down to keep the status quo(electric card, e-gaming, ecommerce) and the everyday retail investors are buying, rich people are buying and giving it more attention online, this is just starting to gain traction, next week will be nuts.

even after the supposed squeeze, the price will most likely stay relatively high, and the company will be relevant for a long time, even if wall street tries to intentionally shut it down again, it won't happen again, so this is good. deepfuckingvalue might actually have saved a company and changed many ordinary people's lives without knowing it

There are purchase stock and option limits, which fluctuates throughout the trading hours to clearly manipulate the market, as seen with $BB and $GME today.

There also been plenty of people posting liquidation of their stocks without their approval, probably due to borrowing money on margin, but typically you should still have 5\~ days to fulfill the margin equity percentage requirement.

Anyways, that's besides the point:

What makes you think these retards won't fucking limit selling due to ""technical issues"" or have ANOTHER ""outage"" AGAIN. They'll let the hedgefucks liquidate, then allow us to sell after all the hedgefucks are out. C'mon tards you've seen this shit before during the SPY put days.

The growth rate of users on dating apps worldwide has been steadily increasing:

[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/dating-app-market/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/dating-app-market/) 

Of these, Tinder is the most popular by a significant amount; hence, I will use that as my example to illustrate some points going forward:

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/826778/most-popular-dating-apps-by-audience-size-usa/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/826778/most-popular-dating-apps-by-audience-size-usa/)

[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tinder-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tinder-statistics/)

Facebook growth rate:

[https://www.statista.com/chart/10047/facebooks-monthly-active-users/](https://www.statista.com/chart/10047/facebooks-monthly-active-users/)

The tinder to Facebook comparison is not intended to illustrate that tinder could ever get into the same level of popularity of Facebook; it is much more niche. Rather, the comparison is to illustrate that the growth rates have similarities proportionally.  

Key factor in business model:

Tinder has two primary sources of income. One of which derives from monetization, which has proven to be extremely fruitful for all social media apps thus far.  

Most importantly, they have a subscription based product, Tinder gold for only $15. This has proven to be extremely successful as 6 million of their total 57 million users use it. That‚Äôs 10% of their total users, that specifically chose for the paid model. To put how vast this percentage is into perspective, YouTube has about 2 billion active users, while only 1.5 million are subscribed to YouTube red for $5.  

What makes tinder gold differ from other traditional free app optional subscriptions:

Unlike many subscriptions, tinder gold does not simply remove the ads from the UI. People are paying for two things primarily; they are first paying for the potential to have their profile be seen by others more, since it is extremely competitive. More importantly, they are also able to see the profiles of people who like them. This is a huge factor, because without it, tinder does not allow you to see who likes you. It forces you to continue swiping on random people until you stumble across someone who liked you. Due to basic human nature, people want to immediately see what people liked them, they want to cut to the chase. Therefore, they are required to sign up for tinder gold in order to see them.

Another huge money maker for tinder is the profile boosters. You can pay a certain fee, in exchange for tinder‚Äôs algorithm to push your own profile into more peoples feeds for a finite period of time. This results in significantly more likes and matches. These are not points or games, these are real people, so many often get a rush from this and continue to use more and more boosts after they see how affective it is.  

These being only three sources of their income alone already should illustrate how advanced Tinder is in terms of marketing their products. Tinder preys on basic human nature, and it has resulted in incredible user and financial growth.

Many of these other dating apps that are owned by Match include very similar marketing tactics. Again, I used tinder as an example simply because it is the most popular, and allows me to simplify some of my points regarding these dating apps. It is also the most profitable, due to the impressive marketing tactics I explained

‚ÄúThe company revealed Tinder pulled in $1.2 billion in revenue over 2019, a 43% increase from 2018. Match owns several other high-profile dating platforms including Hinge and OkCupid, but overall revenue for the year was $2.1 billion meaning it gets more than half its revenue from Tinder.‚Äù

Total balance sheet:

Anecdotal notes:

Perhaps some investors will shun me for even considering anecdotal experience to be note worthy, but I do feel that if some individuals have experienced something, it is more than likely to have occurred outside of that individual experience as well:

A large problem with dating apps is that there is a stigma to meeting someone online, or even having the apps downloaded. Several years ago, I remember seeing jokes about people who ‚Äúneeded‚Äù to use tinder to find girlfriends. I even remember seeing memes about people trying to hide the tinder app three layers deep into a hidden folder on their phones. This stigma certainly still exists, but from my experience, it has certainly decreased. It‚Äôs no longer about ‚Äúneeding‚Äù to use the app, it‚Äôs becoming more normalized. The popularity charts I provided illustrate this as well. Many people don‚Äôt even use tinder to meet people; many simply use it to entertain themselves or meet people virtually.

The stigma is dying, and as it continues to die, there will be continuous increases in users. The largest stigma was actually buying the subscription for ‚ÄúTinder gold‚Äù, which gives you a select amount of features. However, even this is becoming more normalized. People can justify it by simply wanting to see who likes them, rather than being for the benefit of helping your own profile be seen. Curiosity didn‚Äôt kill the cat in this case, but it influenced over 6 million users to spend at least $15 a month. 

Entry point?

I figured now would be a good time to make this post since they are coming off a recent sell off. The support has not proven itself yet, so it certainly has more temporary downside potential. Regardless, if you‚Äôre in it for the long run, this won‚Äôt matter as much. Watch for potential support Monday, 

This post will probably be brushed aside due to the short squeeze focus point at the moment, but feel free to share your thoughts if you do end up reading this. I‚Äôm very open minded and completely accept that I can very well be completely wrong on this. I mostly would like to hear people‚Äôs thoughts regarding the key factors of the business model I mentioned. I really do feel that they are next level in terms of preying on human psychology. It‚Äôs extremely impressive marketing in my opinion from a scientific perspective at least.

I have been investing using fundamentals for a while and I was recently thinking of this overall new dynamic which the market hasn't seen.

With the rise of social media, this was bound to happen sooner rather than later and this whole GME situation might be the tipping point.

Thinking back to Apple and the whole 1984 ad, one can think of that to be a certain meme multiplier back in the day. In fact I think one of the reason Apple is still valued so highly on the market is because out of all the other large tech they actually have the highest MM. Buying Beats and bringing in Dr. Dre for example is something which increases the MM.

A classic example of a MM (which can be thought of as a ratio if nothing else) gain is when Ryan Cohen tweets this for example: https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1350877969816956934

Of course daddy Musk would have the highest MM so far and the stock prices reflect that.

I will try and come up with a mathematical formula to calculate MM better in the next few days. This is just an idea for now."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185714.csv|StockTicker|['MM']|[]|['I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'MM', 'MM', 'A', 'MM', 'MM', 'I', 'MM']|['GME']

I contacted customer service, and asked them to move my shares from margin to cash. They said they could do that, but they would just move back to margin, as Fidelity loans shares for anyone that has a margin account.

I thought making 5.2M on mattress stocks was amazing, but 50M on Gamestop is freaking Godtism.

Second of all, this volatility in the market is once again creating a good opportunity for selling some high premium puts on your favorite stocks. Currently I am not in these positions, with exception to PRPL and DKNG because I believe the red might continue into Monday.

PLTR- PLTR has enjoyed a nice run up and currently you can sell weeklies that give you about 5% downside protection and will allow you to buy the stock for around 33.00 dollars if assigned. If you go two weeks out then the premiums are even better. I selected a couple of the ones I'd consider selling.  This stock is winning lots of government contracts and recently just signed a large deal with Rio tinto Mining (Go SLV gang). Selling 34.00 - 35.00 puts for 1 or 2 weeks out look nice.

&#x200B;

[PLTR Puts](https://preview.redd.it/rvaqjq9awee61.jpg?width=593&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9206bbdfcecc081900adaa3e97b644a0dba2716e)

&#x200B;

You all know the story with purple. I just wanted to reiterate, PRPL hit 41.00 on Monday and has been a victim of the mass sell off with no news. I expect a business update soon and I believe earnings and guidance will be excellent. For those with big balls, 40,s 35's are good plays, for those with small little baby balls, 30's are a good play.

[PRPL](https://preview.redd.it/ak95iq9awee61.jpg?width=428&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d278accd24b796f54e9156640723d57b29de882a)

&#x200B;

SKLZ- take advantage of the huge Igaming surge. SKLZ is being bought up like crazy by Big Dick Cathie Woods. Selling 30's for big ballers and 25's for small ballers.

[SKLZ Feb Puts](https://preview.redd.it/y3y76q9awee61.jpg?width=984&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=addd02c6e8d67818809d9e38011af4e6da248c40)

DKNG- They just recently released numbers and they beat expectations but fell afterwards. They are on their way back and they grew revenue like mad through the pandemic with most sports shut down. The spending on the Mcgregor fight might also be a good money maker for Q1. I like the 53.00 weeklies for next week or 2 weeks out. 55.00 for the big ballers and 57.00 for huge ballers.

[DKNG](https://preview.redd.it/ssesa0aawee61.jpg?width=898&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64a08b43c9ec83646ed9ed2f5716b3a10ddb6d7c)

GME- I am not in GME gang, but as you know, the premiums are huge. Selling weeklies @ 150 strikes gives you nearly 205.00 of downside protection!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a capital intensive play, so tread lightly.

This really says it all.

Yesterday there were 100M in 1 DTE SPY puts purchased yesterday, sold this morning. This morning there were tens of millions more in 0DTE SPY puts purchased.

If anyone can verify this with tier 2 data, I would bet that these 150k/100k/75k Put options were purchased in huge blocks throughout yesterday and today.

We've all known that they are going to bleed their positions to keep GME afloat, but this is worse. They're bleeding the SPY. 401k's, retirement funds, the works.

These trades represent capital generation of somewhere probably in the area of 500 million dollars, which is enough to get them through a couple days of kicking the GME can.

Someone smarter than me needs to work out what we do with this information.

#This narrative is dangerous, and lacks important context about Wall Street's manipulation, greed, and how this whole thing ACTUALLY started.


If this narrative is pushed and becomes believed and accepted, then Wall Street and the SEC could actually have a case for accusing retail investors and WSB of market manipulation. But in case you're new that's **not what happened**


This was the complete and sole result of large firms short selling at a gross rate for over a year, while simultaneously working to push down Gamestop's share price through manipulative tactics like ladder attacks and media hit pieces. They could have covered at $4 for huge gains, but it wasn't enough, They were fully intending to run Gamestop into bankruptcy during a pandemic for maximum profit.


Eventually WSB autists picked up on this and bought the stock **for good reason**, not to collectively just ""fuck the shorts"". Those good reasons include the 148% short interest, GME being undervalued at 4% their revenue, etc etc. You guys know the deal.

This info was spread through WSB as early as last July by our holy Lord &amp; Savior DVT. Hype over GME went on for months here and eventually it was enough to begin the spike. The spike grew as other firms bought in too and news went viral. And yes, other firms are buying in too. No, your friend on Facebook who just downloaded Robintard to buy 1 share at $310 isn't the biggest one ""holding the line"". Even if 25% of adult Americans owned an average GME position of $300, that *still* leaves institutional investors with ~70% of shares. Yeah we're having a HUGE impact on markets right now but don't be naive and downplay the fund's positions too.

Obviously what's happening is incredible, and I'm diamond holding shares &amp; options to the fucking andromeda galaxyüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

But please try to correct the narrative where you can, and add the important context. It can make the difference between retail investors getting legal protection or being regulated out of existence.

TL;DR: WSB sparked this but greedy and manipulative Wall Street short sellers were the gunpowder and don't let anyone forget.

&#x200B;

I noticed the premium for selling a call way out, say January 2023, is 320.5, on the $2 strike

So now, shares of GME are 312.

So in theory, if I took my $31,200 and bought 100 shares, and sold the $2 call, even if I just met the ask, I get 320 premium. So my 31200 becomes 32000, and eventually 32200 after the call expires and I get an extra 200. But essentially I turned 31200 into 32000 with no effort. So 800 per contract sold.

Obviously volume is low, but say I could do this 200x (which according to asks, it's 320.5), that's 850 profit per contract (32,050-31200). So now I can take my 32050 and do the same, and eventually, after 36th one sold, I can then start selling 2, etc. And after my 200th, which takes up all the volume for the ones that profit an average of 850, I have an extra $170,000.

Obviously this cannot be correct. What am I missing?

&#x200B;

TLDR:

&#x200B;

Buy a stock for 31200, sell a covered call and get 32050. That's a profit of 850. Rinse and repeat until you have sold to all the asks over the share price, 200x. Not only are 20,000 shares locked up for a bit in long term options, but you have gained 850 profit 200x, which is 170k.

&#x200B;

WHAT AM I MISSING? Where does this go south?

&#x200B;

Edit: The answer is I forgot to account for the fact GME closed at 324, and the bid is 320. So you would lose 400 per trade. Now if it followed the meeting in the middle of the Bid ask spread then it would be a 150 profit per trade, but only 76 of those exist. Thanks  u/boblawslawblawg

YOU FUCKIN WRONG CAUSE WE GOT SOME HOMIES ON DECK ROBINHOODS JUST A SMALL INDIE COMPANY COMPARED TO THEM

A PREFACE: DO NOT XFER OUT OF RH. THIS ADVICE IS FOR NEW BUYERS ONLY OR FOR THOSE WHO HOLD MORE THAN 5 SHARES IN RH AND WANT TO BUY MORE. ANYONE BOUGHT ON RH, DISABLE STOP LIMIT. DISABLE MARGIN, AND HOLD ON CASH.

Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further WE GOT TOO FUCKING BIG!. GOOD! due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

üöÄüöÄFidelity and VanguardüöÄüöÄ. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. They will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take this opportunity by the balls and never let go. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Holding $250k üöÄGMEüöÄ [proof]( https://imgur.com/ylnsvES). I was a permabull until I hit the submit button on this post

Now that I got your limited autistic attention with the troll-baiting title. Now that I‚Äôve won you over to my side with my retarded fucking yolo position on üöÄGMEüöÄ, I am going to share with you my prediction on stock market as a whole for the next six months. 

#TLDR
Hold üöÄGMEüöÄ until Citadel is dead. Puts on anything a few months after that. Wall street will win in the end but I‚Äôll come out on top.

#Where we are today
It‚Äôs not hard to argue that we are in a large bubble of epic proportions. We had COVIND shut down the world economy and less than 1 year later the SPY is trading up 65% from the bottom. Meanwhile we have tech stocks like TSLA up over 500%. I don‚Äôt think this is sustainable and we are overdue for a bear market. 

‚ÄúOkay, so what will happen?‚Äù
Good question!

#What will happen
##Short Term (1-4 weeks)
This üöÄGMEüöÄ short squeeze is going to trigger, and it will trigger soon. Once the short sellers get margin called the price of üöÄGMEüöÄ is going to rocket up to incomprehensible levels. (I‚Äôm holding till $69,420) Some hedge funds will die out, maybe we kill off a broker. Who knows, maybe a too bank if we‚Äôre lucky. The retail investors will get a win and the overall stock market will be okay.  At $10,000/share the market cap is only $700 billion. This is a lot to us, but not enough to actually impact wall street.
Maybe üöÄGMEüöÄ is just the start and wsb starts buying up other over shorted meme stocks. I don‚Äôt know, but i wouldn't bet that wall street will let us get more than one win in-a-row.  

Once the üöÄGMEüöÄ squeeze is squoze we move on to the mid term.

##Mid Term (1-3 months)
In the case of üöÄGMEüöÄ retail won and hedge funds lost. Wall Street doesn‚Äôt like losing and now they know that we can hold them by the balls and start a short squeeze on other stocks with infinite risk involved to the hedge funds.  
For example, If the short float ratio for a stock is 70% and wsb goes in and buys up 40% of the shares holding them in diamond hands, guess what happens. We artificially limit the float causing a short ratio of more than 100%. 
The hedge funds will see this coming and start to off load their shorts before they get stuck in another short squeeze. 

While this is happening the hedge funds will be buying back stocks at an increasing price. Since retail won with üöÄGMEüöÄ, and now that they have all this new money with a risk tolerance of a mentally disabled gorilla, they will start buying up all these stocks little the dumb kids they are. It‚Äôs going to look like retail is about to start another new type of bubble that will last forever. A bubble built on the speculation that meme stocks will short squeeze again and again. A **squebble‚Ñ¢** if you will. Really what is happening is that the hedge funds are exiting their short positions and taking the loss before another squeeze starts. We will know this is happening if the over shorted meme-stocks start raising in price while the short shares start declining. This brings us to the third and final term. 

##Long term (4 - 8 months)
Okay quick recap: 
We‚Äôre in a bubble
hedge funds are closing shorts
retail is buying up everything. 

This is going to be the end of short selling to this extreme. Not because of regulations, or fines, or prison time, but because we now have the power to abuse the system against them. Hedge funds or brokers won‚Äôt allow this type of overeverage from happening again. Since short selling is a very profitable tactic that is now off the table, the value added in from the margin trades will diminish and the stock market is going to decrease in value. Hedge funds will see the writing on the wall and start to move into safe investments. Maybe they go into cash, maybe into gold, I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm just a 25 year old engineer who doesn‚Äôt really know shit about the stock market or where money flows to in a bear market. 

#End game
Still here? Great! Follow me to the epic conclusion of this 2 page novel. 
Hedge funds are moving money into safe investments before the impending bear market. Retail, however, is still high on life like a fucking dipwad huffing paint buying up everyhting under the sun. Pretty soon the hedges and retail will stop buying because of exhaustion (It literally can‚Äôt go up forever, sorry bulls ü§°)  We all saw what happens when there is no one to buy a stock thanks to Robinhood removing the buy button. In this case it will be because no one will buy since everything is way too overvalued. **This is when everything comes tumbling down.** It will start with the risky meme and tech stocks since those are what wallstreet will exit from first. Then it will cascade into everything else. 

We are about to witness a bubble pop larger than anything ever before. This time the game has been changed against wall street and only an epic bear market will remove retail from the big kids table once again.

I am not a financial advisor. This is a DD (Due Diligence) post in regard to the upcoming squeeze aimed at AMC. The information is a collection of research from credible sources with some of my personal thoughts on the topic.

NOTE: ANYONE WHO IS INFORMED ON THE MARKET AND HOW IT WORKS, SKIP TO PART 2.

This DD will cover more than average DD's since WSB has gained a large following of new traders who can benefit from a full description.

Part 1: $AMC, what is it? üéûÔ∏èüéüÔ∏è

---[Source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Theatres)---
AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. is an American movie theater chain headquartered in Leawood, Kansas, and the largest movie theater chain in the world. Founded in 1920, AMC has the largest share of the U.S. theater market ahead of Regal and Cinemark Theatres.

Part 1.2: What is a squeeze?ü§èüèº

A squeeze in the market ($GME, $AMC) is a phenomenon that occurs when shorts have to be covered, especially by high class traders (hedge fund managers). 

Part 1.3:What are shorts, why are they popular with the top 1%?

In short selling, a position is opened by borrowing shares of a stock that the investor believes will decrease in value by a set future date . The investor then sells these borrowed shares to buyers willing to pay market price. Before the borrowed shares must be returned, the trader is betting on the prices decline and then can purchase them at a lower cost. This stategy is HIGH RISK HIGH REWARD.

Part 1.4 (final intro peice): Why do squeezes cause losses up top?

Simple. In the case of $GME the hedge funds bet that $GME would fall. Logically, they should have been right. But as I'm sure everyone knows, WSB and working class investors from all over the world flipped the trend on its head. So, since the hedge funds bet on a fall they had to cover the losses caused by their BORROWED positions becoming absolutely useless (nice). 

Part 2: The stats on $AMC. üìàüß†

---Paraphrased from ""Yahoo Finance"", Some IMO.---

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 101.95 million shares. Now what everyone is waiting for it when shorted shares become useless and the hedge funds have to cover what they bet and lost on. Today's target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 and we closed at $13.29! This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Feb 1/21) So Monday when they're forced to cover the $8.63 they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher from said stimulus. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96.  Over the next few trading days it is going to be a strong squeeze. $AMC is standing where $GME did a week ago. Hold your ground. Gains coming in hot next week. 

Part 3: What are our targets for buying and selling?üíµüìàüíµ

THIS REQUIRES DIAMOND HANDS üíéüëê

From what I have read, buying into $AMC at $17 or below is a safe bet. My exit plan is to secure some profit next week as the squeeze reaches it's height, and reinvest (into $AMC)  a comfortable amount based on collected gain. I plan to keep shares for up to 12-18 months so long as $AMC keeps on the track we can see now.
AGAIN, I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. MY WORD IS NOT LAW.

Part 4: Beware The Big Man (Reason for Holding)üè¶üö´

Big money managers and short sellers are going to manipulate the stock in the after hours session to scare us investors out of buying and holding with the intent of executing their shorts as planned or to cushion the blow from failed investment. Again, üëêüíé.

Part 5: The Conclusion on $AMC in short (wording wise) üöÄüöÄ

‚Ä¢The statistics on this stock are legit. 

‚Ä¢The company is longstanding (70+ years)

‚Ä¢The company is legit

‚Ä¢A squeeze is seemingly inevitable

‚Ä¢Being the largest theatre company, post COVID gains are likely as cinemas will re-open.

‚Ä¢The hedge funds are in a position to be bent over again via their shorts in $AMC.

‚Ä¢Last but not least, I know alot of you autists lost alot of money gambling during highs on $KTOV, $XSPA, $GNUS, and many others... So why not get some tendies for once.

--------------------------------

AGAIN I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, THIS IS A COLLECTION OF DATA AND RESEARCH BASED ON RECENT TRENDS AND $AMC's POSITION IN THE MARKET AS OF CLOSE ON (1/29/21)
I AM NOT LIABLE FOR LOSSES OR THE REASON FOR GAIN.
THIS POST IS STRICTLY FOR SHARING INFORMATION GATHERED.

TL/DR: üíéüëêüìàüöÄüåë

(typed on mobile, computer format may be fucked up)

Edit: Monkey brain was on overdrive while typing, I know shorts do not expire but monkey brain like thinking about put options.

I am also aware alot of us are receiving different numbers regarding floating shares and shares outstanding. I included the name of my source, take it up with yahoo not me.

Been on WSB for the past month and have been watching the GME antics unfold. Last Sunday my cousin came from out of town to plan are attack on GME. He arrives and I invite my other buddy to joins us  to discuss our  plans for Monday morning 
 to purchase shares/options of GME. 

I had this burning sensation in my soul that I was going to make a-lot of money from this. I was planning on spending my entire portfolio (only about 1200 at the time)on GME calls/ shares. We stay up all night watching in awe as GME breaks through the stratosphere, shaking in excitement of the day to come. I begin getting lost in my thoughts about how I will distribute my winnings with my loved one especially my mother. 

I grew up on welfare after my parents split up at an early Age. My dad fell out of the picture and  my mother raised my siblings and I while she  attended  college/worked full time in hopes to provide us a better quality of life for the years to come. Years later My mother succeeded  in receiving  her degree and became a special Ed teacher and was able to make enough to support us. I have always wanted to be able to pay her back for everything she did for my siblings and I, I thought this would be my time. 

The morning comes along and I am refreshing the calls GME every second in hopes of scoring a calls. The page finally load and  calls where far  out of my budget, feeling the disappointment over come me I make the decision to buy 6 BB calls instead. The Next day comes around I‚Äôm down -700 in calls and there is GME calls for 1/29 that are only 390 a contract. What happened next will blow your mind, instead of jumping at the opportunity I had been waiting for I decide that i shouldn‚Äôt cut my losses just yet on my BB contracts and see if I can make some profit before  I purchase the GME contracts,(quite frankly one of the biggest mistake I‚Äôve made in my life). 

I run a few errands and an hour or two goes by before  I check my phone and am swept over with The realization of how fatal of a mistake I have made. The life inside of me leaves my body and I am filled with an aching pit of agony as glazed eyes stare at my phone screen to see my 4 contracts would have been worth 80k, my knees buckle I am now sick to my stomach. Granted I probably would have paper handed my calls the moment  I saw 20k in profit and creamed my pants. The day goes by and I am over ridden with crippling depression. The next day comes around I sell my BB calls for 1200 profit which is the most I‚Äôve ever made on a trade. How ever instead of celebrating this victory,  I feel like it is nothing  but an immense failure. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I am extremely thrilled we got to fuck over the Hedge-funds  and happy for every body who has been able to make massive  gains, but I cannot get rid of the feeling that I missed on the opportunity of a life time. I cannot go on media without being reminded of my fatal mistake and it makes me sick. I am thinking of temporarily deleting my social media and taking a break of trading until I get over this. The depression is real I‚Äôm a working class guy and make maybe 35k a year, the money I would have made would have been life changing, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs makes this pill so hard to swallow If anybody else is experiencing this immense FOMO hang in there don‚Äôt be a bitch and we will get over this or possibly not."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185654.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['WSB', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'BB', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'BB', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'BB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'FOMO']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

If they do this, they could pay down their 2023 debt (which doesn't have a very favorable interest rate) and go into the tech transformation *debt free*. This is very important for their future credit rating as well because right now that credit rating is on the lowest level, which means they can only borrow money for stupendously high interest rates.

Anyway I think its mind-blowing what I've put together, but it's a different kind of art - I'm obsessed with ticker symbols. When I go to my brokerage, I see museum quality and beyond, incredible ticker symbols that I see as art - ones you just don‚Äôt find in everybody's brokerage.

When it comes to buying a random combination of letters, I am purely from the gut and I know right away. If it stays in my brain‚Äîlet‚Äôs say I go see a ticker, if I keep thinking about it, I know it‚Äôs something I like. If I forget about it, then I know, couldn‚Äôt care less...

My collection doesn't includes signature, quintessential works of sought-after tickers - I just like certain letter combinatuons. 

You know what a perfect day is for me? A perfect day is going down to Vanguard, or Fidelity, or if I'm slumming it Robinhood, and I just look at letter combinations and then grab lunch‚Äîto me, perfect day.

While I almost never sell at a profit, the investing aspect of letter combinations has never been part of the allure of collecting for me‚ÄîI do not approach it the way I buy physical disks of video games, or sell them when I'm done playing them to recoup value...

I probably enjoy looking at letter combinations that I appreciate more than one that I don't appreciating.  But I don‚Äôt think the financial part is a big part of it. I don't like to make mistakes.

You can‚Äôt collect random letter combinations at my level for losses over many years and not have a real passion for it‚Äîat the end of the day, it‚Äôs not going to change my life financially.

Below, a cross-section of my random letter combination collection in my brokerage account.

This past week has been a moment where the proles have been able to figure out a way to steal from the rich legally. We found a ‚Äúcheat code‚Äù as has been referred to on the news. GameStonk, har har. They, the rich have rebelled and acted illegally in plain sight. And they truly, truly believe they‚Äôre going to get away with it. Like without a doubt they don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre going to lose. They think they‚Äôll just continue to manipulate the market, pay for lies on every news outlet, and have our elected officials cast us as the bad guy. It‚Äôll happen.

Ask yourself, what would you do if you were in Melvin‚Äôs shoes? Would you give up and capitulate to a bunch of mouth breathing basement dwellers or fight back? 

So what do we know? We know that the media is spinning the narrative that Melvin ‚Äúclosed its position‚Äù. 

Does this mean they exited their short? Maybe, maybe not. 

Given the current short interest (over 100% by most sources, maybe even 250% by others) and the consensus that they did not have time to fully exit the position when they said they did, one conclusion is that their position was not exited but still remains. 

Is it possible that their pride would not allow them to be defeated, and they pledged, assigned or otherwise sold their position via derivative or other structured offering to a trusted third party, to give the illusion that they exited, thus causing WSB and other longs to sell off?

There are two Citadels. Citadel the hedge fund (HF- Cohen) and Citadel Securities (MM). 

We know that Citadel Securities pays Robinhood (and others) for our order flow. Using this data, they are in the best possible position to see when sentiment is on the sell side for Citadel HF‚Äôs newly acquired Melvin short position.  

Of course it is absurd to think that these two Citadels don‚Äôt interact or share data because there is a ‚ÄúChinese Wall‚Äù between them. (Time to take a tequila shot.)

We also know that Cohen, via Citadel HF, ‚Äúloaned‚Äù‚Äù or ‚Äúinvested‚Äù nearly 3 billion to Melvin as a lifeline. What we don‚Äôt know is how this money was allocated, or for what purpose.

One theory is that Melvin used the money to purchase calls of various strikes and expiry on GME to hedge its losses. (There is another post about this topic.) This seems unlikely for several reasons better explained in that post. 

Another theory is this 3 billion was the magical number to ‚Äúclose its position.‚Äù Unverified, so let‚Äôs assume for now it‚Äôs not accurate.

Given the hubris and big dick swinging energy of these funds, another alternative is that they wanted their cake and to fucking eat it too. 

Ask yourself, what is more likely: they (1)!exit and go quietly, accepting their losses to a bunch of independent amateurs riding the short bus; or (2) be the greedy AF as history has shown time and time again?

Perhaps they didn‚Äôt ‚Äúclose the position‚Äù but assigned it to Citadel HF, which is well capitalized. (Possibly even with the caveat of buying it back). 

They then use the Citadel capital infusion to load up on GME shorts right before Citadel Securities (via Robinhood) restricted trading. 

Capital could also be used to gobble up shares when GME went into free-fall with those calculated ladder attacks or when GME shareholders were stopped out.

Citadel HF then rides the existing Melvin short position down to the ground, profiting on that trade, as WSB and other longs capitulate due to restrictions and other fuckery.

TLDR: Melvin Capital is still a part of the short interest and has not closed its position.

At some point, Gamestop is likely going to offer stock/rights/whatever to capitalize on their increased value. This is a good thing for the company, and for shareholders. 

For the company, they can make a fairly small offering and gain a ton of money to bankroll future growth or their pivot to e-commerce. For the shareholders, it serves as a floor on the stock price. Consider, if the company offers 35MM shares at $300. That would give them $10.5 billion in their war chest, for 100M shares. This is immediately a bare minimum value of $100/share just in book value. Add in their enterprise value and even the bear case is $150. This would legitimately give them a bull case over $500/share. This would force shorts to cover, while leaving the short percent at ~60%. This would still be a massive squeeze and set up the company for the future.

Alternately, the company could issue a rights offering, which is basically an option to buy. Each shareholder gets 1/2 a right, which can then be traded. If the rights are at $300/share, then they are worth the difference between that and share value. But also, shorts are then short a right as well, incentivizing them to cover, or else they'd have to also cover the right. This acts as a dividend and a share offering. It would *also* raise cash for the company and increase book value, especially if the company finds a broker to guarantee it, saying that they will exorcize any unexorcized rights.

This is one of the benefits of having a high stock price - the ability to raise funds. It's what has allowed tesla to grow as rapidly as it did. And it becomes synergistic. High stock price allows companies to raise money, which in turn helps push their price higher.

These are the same people that colluded with Charter Communications back in the day, in what is fondly called ‚Äúthe Summer of Love‚Äù. They‚Äôve been able to charge us monopoly prices by divvying out the map and deciding to only provide cable in certain areas of the map, so if you‚Äôre in those areas you have one little choice. This allows them to make the price anything they way. Although we have Netflix and slightly more cable options, till this day our internet and broadband providers are 10x slower and 10x more expensive than countries like South Korea. They have no business telling us that we‚Äôre doing is immoral or criminal!! Especially when we take down evil suits named Melvin *spits out of respect*.

They also bought calls that expired on Friday to profit when the stock went back up.

What's to stop the hedge funds from continuing this strategy until they drive the price down enough and get enough profit from calls FDs so that a squeeze won't happen?

**1. Hedge Funds don't create value, they can die**

If they go bankrupt who fucking cares? They don't create any value, they just bet on companies and in some cases drive them out of business for the sole purpose of making money. Wether you believe in GameStop's fundamentals and financials or not there was no reason for its stock to be at $4 dollars, and ultimately put 14,000 people out of their job, ever.

Even on a personal level, all those suits have money set aside in tax havens, I'm certainly not worried about them, we still won't ever get close to 1% of their net worth.

**2.** **HF are taking everyone down**

Looking at this week's events they're basically fucking everyone over. They're fucking the brokers who are out of liquidity because of financial requirements therefore have to limit trading etc, the clearinghouses who have to protect themselves by asking for 100% of collateral on those trade which impacts the brokers, us, ultimately the banks. And they are tanking the market by closing large positions in BABA, SPY, whatever just to stay afloat.

**3.** **Only Wall Street isn't on our side**

Who is against us? Only the crooks! No one else is saying ""Yeah 140% short is perfectly normal, it shouldn't be illegal, they need to be saved."" The world is watching, all the peasants on the planet want to make them pay, politicians from all parties agree, we're backed up by ""celebrities"" and the likes. Honestly I've even read some decent articles.

**4. 2008, pandemic, Biden**

Do I need to remind anyone about 2008? Do I need to remind anyone we're in the middle of a pandemic, people are out of jobs, businesses are closing, healthcare workers are overworked? Biden just took office, does he want to fuck himself over in his first week? And he won't go for a second mandate so he might as well take them out.

**All in all**

Given today's situation, I want to believe that the government can't leave the retail investors hold the bags after this is over. I can't imagine the repercussions this would have if we are betrayed by everyone and the scumbags get bailed out billions given the current state of the economy. It is also a truly unique opportunity, knowing 2008 precedents, to finally put them against their crimes and improve the system.

**One more thing, institutions own 70% of GME**

Let's say everyone is on our side, stars are aligned. Institutions like HF don't care about us and probably don't care either about taking down other HF. They have the upper hand, what hand are they playing?

üíéüñêüöÄüåï

TLDR; Melvin and co should die, they don't create value. It's a domino effect, because they don't want to cover they're taking down the brokers, clearinghouses, the market, us, ultimately the banks. The world is watching, everyone is on our side but them. 2008 memories, pandemic (distressed population and economy), Biden has been in office for 1 week. Isn't it in everyone's best interest that they don't get bailed out and that we aren't left bag holding? However institutions (including HF) own 70% of GameStop, even if it all goes well, we could still be fucked over, what hand are they playing?

Edit: I even want to add BLM to general public sentiment (wether you agree or not - we are apolitical), redistribution of wealth and to some extent positive repercussions for charities and the economy."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185643.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'HF', 'BABA', 'SPY', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'HF', 'HF', 'I', 'BLM']|['BABA']

This subreddit has seen a surge of 5,5m people in these last days. That's a lot of people and thats great. But I think theres a few people that don't know a lot about the short squeeze and are here for a quick buck.

if you thought you could profit by the end of this week, this was not the case. The shorts at Wednesday gained an advantage. Imagine if we could stop the market when we had a red day. We would all be billionaires by now. That's what they did. 

I still think the squeeze is still in play though. This means, this will not be as quick and they expect new people to lose interest/panic sell so they can cover lower. It's all or nothing for them. They could pull more insane stuff by next week, you can count that as a possibility. 

That's why its important to understand the play here and not just jump on the hype wagon. You're doing more harm that way. Learn about short squeezes and educate yourself on what has happened till now. 

TLDR: I believe the squeeze is still on. But due to Thursday, it may have gone back a week or so. Due to a surge in people here, they may expected a squeeze to occur on friday. And I could imagine that hedge funds bet on new people losing interest. That's why its important to educate yourselves, To make your own opinion about the stock.

We're based in Europe and as far as I can tell, there are only american Silver futures available (CMEgroup). I don't have experience in trading futures.

So here are some open questions regarding this:

Can we as europeans trade CME silver futures and can we let them deliver to a warehouse in our Country? If yes, what about shipment costs?

reference: [https://www.cmegroup.com/confluence/display/EPICSANDBOX/Silver](https://www.cmegroup.com/confluence/display/EPICSANDBOX/Silver)

There it's mentioned that March is an active future month. What does that mean? Physical delivery can only take place in march?

Additionally, fellow europeans - any idea about upcoming taxes for the physical delivery? We have to pay VAT for buying silver here as far as I know.

So - do you think the physical delivery is even possible? Also to Europe?

let's do this!

e/ I'm already long slv/pslv and silver options. And with slv I mean a european a fully backed european version ""Xtrackers Physical Silver ETC""

e2/ why did I even ask in here! Does anybody even read the text? I know it requires an attention spawn of more than 20 seconds, but come on...

e3/ Some of you didn't fully comprehend, that it's all about getting silver physically. As far as I know, the Papermarket is 250 times bigger than the physical market. A Shortage in the physical market will potentially cause moon prices.  Just read the DDs on silver from the last days:

As I understand it:

* Revolut - Uses a third party (Edit: Generally positive ITT but no ISA wrapper)

* Etoro - Uses a third party and restricted some US stocks

* HL - Terrible app, long order fulfilment time (Edit: Some people ITT say it‚Äôs great though and only experienced issues at open)

It‚Äôs unraveled so quickly, primarily in an arena hardly understood by many, that it‚Äôs not surprising the real human story would somehow get tangled within the misinformation of social and corporate media. The story arcs are so complex and the threads so wrapped up in a frayed society that it‚Äôs difficult to trace them back to the supposed players in any given corner. The entire world, since this devastating virus hit, is a testament to that. 

It would be a disservice to any reader to demarcate these players and their roles in this game because you likely already have your own understanding of who they are and what their objective may be. And if not, there‚Äôs a plethora of information strewn across the internet. This letter isn‚Äôt meant to sway or convince you of which corner of the ring to hang your hat on. It's my own personal synthesis trying to make sense of all the forces at work here, and it‚Äôs an entreaty for every reader to zoom out and take into account the blooming dynamic of an increasingly fractured society, and hopefully come to your own conclusions about how we all got here.

Now, more than ever, we have been using actions over words in an attempt to be heard. And this particular week, the drama played out on Wall Street between Hedge Funds and millions of individuals, and has become another dog-eared page in the history book of whatever the hell we‚Äôre going through right now. 

It should come as no surprise that millions of individuals emptied their linty pockets to put forward whatever money they had in order to back a company that had been shorted to oblivion during a time of crisis and quarantine. These are the same people who got tangled in the outdated bureaucratic unemployment system, or were forced to work because they were suddenly deemed essential. And yet they still struggled to find ways to pay rent, buy diapers, food, and worry about the ramifications of contracting the virus not because they feared for their life, but because the medical bills were more of a death sentence than the virus. 

Meanwhile, these short sellers maintained their long positions, which were essentially tantamount to rooting for the death knell of one of the few companies actually helping many stay sane during the quarantine; second, perhaps, only to any local animal shelter. Once lauded as virtuous for rooting out fraud within corrupt companies, it‚Äôs become clear that short sellers lost their path somewhere along the way, which isn‚Äôt a surprise, really, because the entire concept is that they‚Äôre betting on something to fail for their own benefit.

And here‚Äôs the thing: almost everyone on this WallStreetBets subreddit bought into this company because, you guessed it: they like the stock. When it was announced that Ryan Cohen (the man responsible for putting those Chewy boxes on doorsteps that were infinitely more valuable to pets than the toys in them) became a board member, enthusiasm shot through the roof. The so-called ‚Äútendies‚Äô only became more juicy when WSBers realized the hedge funds held long shorts, due to the intrinsic value that many believed GameStop now possessed with a newly added visionary board member, and the faith that they could pivot from their old business model into a highly successful new one.

More and more individual retail investors read the due diligence written and posted by numerous Redditors over the course of several months last year, and also threw their money behind the company. And then when the hedge funds‚Äô initial long contracts expired: they doubled down. And retail investors still believed in this stock, so they kept buying it. And then hedge funds doubled down again. Instead of cutting their losses, the hedge funds KEPT. DOUBLING. DOWN. Which brings us to the immediate present, and the entire maelstrom playing out before our very eyes. 

What initially started as a very enticing investment opportunity for retail investors quickly morphed into what was effectively a hedge fund throwing around billions of dollars to save themselves from the absurd and somehow still legal short contracts they placed in the first place. And in reflecting on everything that happened in 2008, it should come as no surprise that millions of individual retail investors would legally do whatever was in their power to actually hold these hedge funds accountable for their actions this time around. 

At this point, no one really knows what happens next, and there are numerous possibilities as to what the fallout may be. And to offer any speculation could be construed as potentially misleading, and harmful, at worst. These are the facts as one individual sees them after much due diligence and synthesis. What each and every one of you does with this information is your own responsibility. 

Power to the Players,

The calls with the highest open interest were 320 and almost everything between 100 and 200.

So what I am confused about is how does this benefit retail GME shareholders? I understand it decreases the amount of available shares which only helps load up the rocket to Alpha Centauri. However, what is stopping hedge funds from buying the contracts before close themselves and exercising, allowing them to start getting an advantage in owning more shares? Once they own the shares can't they just sell covered calls on them into next week and start making enough to make back a portion of losses? Is there even enough shares available to allow everyone to exercise?

EDIT: Thank you for the replies! I understand better now.

One last question:

Of course shorts will not willingly be covering at 500%+ losses and will try to drag this out as long as possible in hopes that us retards cave in. Ultimately, is the thing that will set this off the brokers who will start closing the shorts for the hedge funds at any price because hedge funds are unable to meet margin requirements and pay off their interests? I'm assuming this is represented by the ""days to cover"" number."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185652.csv|StockTicker|['ITM']|[]|['GME', 'ITM', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'GME']

Put on your reading glasses because your autistic ass doesn't get a TL:DR on this one, and you degenerates don't get any fucking emojis from me either.

*Ahem*

The Gay Bears had run a casino for a long time, and the house was rigged. The Retard Bulls who played knew this; but some were able to get lucky; so the other Retard Bulls mostly just looked the other way while the Gay Bears stole millions and millions of dollars from the Bulls' parents every ten years or so.

Until one day an especially autistic bull named Diamond Hooves learned how to count cards, and sought to get rich. Counting cards is not illegal, and Diamond Hooves secretly employed his method of card counting at many different tables in the casino, and he made a lot of money. But Diamond Hooves was very upset with what he saw while he won his money in the casino. Many other bulls were losing money to the Gay Bears, and it made Diamond Hooves very sad at first; and then very angry.

In his contempt for what the Gay Bears had done to his autistic bretheren, Diamond Hooves started to teach his secret method of card counting to every bull he knew. Once he was satisfied that he had educated enough of his bretheren, he led them to the most vulnerable table in the entire casino. The intention was clear, the Retard Bulls had all gathered of their own free will for a single purpose: To sit and play at the table where the Games Stop.

Diamond Hooves was very clear about his table selection, and he had indeed chosen the right table to bankrupt the Gay Bears. This was becoming clear to other Retard Bulls who had not yet decided that they wanted to join Diamond Hooves in counting cards at the table where the games stop. Unfortunately, the Gay Bears also knew that their casino could lose all of its money if too many Bulls counted cards at the table where the games stop; and they had a plan to defeat the bulls.

The Bears employed strongarm tactics to scare the bulls away from the table at first; but this only drew more bulls in. The Beears then stacked the decks against the bulls; but so many bulls had come to the table that it didn't matter. The bulls knew that they had to be willing to be bagholders. They had to be like Diamond Hooves.

The Gay Bears lured the bulls to other tables that would only serve to delay victory at the table where the Games Stop, and sucked them in to the losing tables with false comforts like movies and blackberries. Eventually some of these poor Bulls lost all of their money; but some were able to take the money they stashed away while watching movies and eating blackberries and take it back to the table where the Games Stop. If they had not done this; the battle may have been lost to the Gay Bears.

The Bears had one final set of tricks up their sleeves; and they disallowed any more Bulls to sit at the table where the Games Stop, and then limited new arrivals; and they started a program of disinformation. The Bears sought to villify the Retard Bulls playing at the table where the Games Stop, and they also sought to cover their losses by luring other bulls  into the casino so that they could lose money while eating blackberries and watching movies. It was never forgotten the the Bulls playing with Diamond Hooves at the table where the Games Stop were the good guys, or that the Gay Bears were the bad guys. Too many bulls had been bankrupted. Too many bull families had been kept in poverty for too many generations. The Game had to Stop.

To this day Diamond Hooves is still sitting at the table, calling his bretheren to count cards and bankrupt the casino. More and more bulls are joining, and the stakes keep getting higher and higher. Can you hear him in the distance?

""Remain at the table where the Games Stop with Diamond Hooves!""

""This does not work unless you are willing to hold an empty bag with Diamond Hooves!""

""Don't be distracted by movies or blackberries or anything else. Come play with Diamond Hooves!""

""Come to the table where the Games Stop with Diamond Hooves!""

Disclaimer: This is a metaphor; so it is DEFINITELY NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS FINANCIAL ADVICE.

GME, 5 shares bought at 360ish because I am more autistic than you; and I like the fucking stock more than you.

I will play with diamond hands.

So, we all remember the first attack on WSB last week, resulting in the sub going private for an hour so that the mods could get things under control.

If you recall, it was a pure numbers game. Insane amount of obvious bots with brand new accounts spamming tickers and üöÄ with no other actual content.

It was extremely easy to spot and report suspicious accounts. Mods took control quickly.

They have adapted. **Quickly**. The manipulation is currently much more sophisticated.

HFs underestimated individual investors and currently find themselves in a world of trouble. Do not make the same mistake they did. Consider the following:

&#x200B;

Every time you see a post that is ever so subtly guiding your attention away from GME, or has a general tone that the squeeze is basically over, or is giving good SI indicators about other potential squeezes etc, open their profile and do the following:

* **Posts**. Things to look for:

1. What were they posting about a few weeks ago. If its only topics unrelated to finance/investing‚û°Ô∏èsuspicious
2.  When was the last time they made a post before starting to post about GME/investing. If theres a time horizon greater than 2+ weeks between their usual activity and current GME squeeze posts‚û°Ô∏èsuspicious . 
3. *Telltale signs*: Account has a long history, posting about topics unrelated to finance and investing. Out of the blue, successive GME squeeze related posts. 

* **Comments**: 

1. Scroll through the comments to get a general sentiment and feeling of how ‚Äúreal‚Äù the account is. If they seem to be parroting a lot of GME squeeze related stances in great succession, followed once again by a time period cushion before their usual comments on other unrelated topics ‚û°Ô∏èsuspicious

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I will not repeat what everyone has heard and is already well aware of by now. We are in a historic event. The stakes are high. Huge sums are involved. Recognize the magnitude of the situation and approach every interaction with caution. Social media manipulation has been ‚Äúsolved‚Äù over the last decade, be constantly aware of that. Any information you read, always do your own research, on the topic and on the source itself.

And, of course GME üöÄüöÄüöÄ

EDIT: In regards to the 2+ week time horizon between non finance topics and GME, that only applies to POSTS that are very confident in their advice. Obviously that doesn‚Äôt apply to comments.

I eventually created a reddit account but even then took a while to actually join the sub rather than just lurk.  So I was here for a good number of the ""fun"" moments of the last few years.  The box spreads that ""literally can't go tits up"".  Everyone piling on puts on snapchat.  Good 'ol Su Bae.  The great paper trading competition of 2019.  The ousting of ""he who shall not be named"" (the automod removed my post for mentioning his name).  Etcetera, etcetera...   But this will be my first post.

Over the last week and especially the last 24 hours, I've seen a LOT of comments in the pinned threads lamenting the fact that WSB is forever changed and that it's time for another paper trading competition.  I want to speak to that for a moment and if the mods would be so kind as to keep this post up I'd be very grateful.

First of all, yes, WSB has changed, but that's a *good thing.*  You know who else doesn't want change?  The hedge funds, and Wall Street.  The whole point of this thing that is happening IS CHANGE.  The fact that the world is standing to attention right now says something about this is real and that is much more important than being able to remove some noobs because their IQ is too high.

Even worse than the comments calling for noobs to be eliminated, I've seen many commenters dissing people who can only afford small amounts of shares or even fractional shares.  So now WSB is elitist and you have to be wealthy to join and have fun in the markets?  NO!  That's the entire point of this place and GME and this week is that the market SHOULD NOT BE FOR THE ELITE ONLY.

**Have 5mil and want to invest?  Great!  Have $5 and want to invest.  Great!**

WSB endlessly attacks CNBC, etc for not being able to see that GME is NOT about WSB or the fundamentals of these companies, or about making money.  But it's about something much bigger.  And those people who are crying out for all the noobs here to be banned are no better than the entrenched elite like Stephen Weiss who yesterday called this whole thing ""load of crap"".

We all saw the open letter pinned earlier this week and the responses to it.  We all lived through last year.  And for the first time in a VERY long time, I feel like the world is coming together to unite rather than to divide and it feels f'ing GOOD.

Let the moment stand for a bit.  I promise you that eventually people will forget about this and we will all start attacking each other again and most of the noobs on WSB will never set foot in this place again.

But for now, for today, for this weekend, and maybe a while more, let's be excellent to one another and not decide the worth of someone over how long they've had a reddit account or how much money is in their band account.

So to all the noobs:

Welcome!  Hope you enjoy your stay.  It gets a little weird around here, so it would save you a lot of time if you just gave up and went mad now.

Due to your actions last week you forced many of us to make a decision of what platforms we will be using to trade from in the future. I personally moved all of my funds from RH to another platform. What you may not realize is that there are a LOT of people who did this as well. All of my funds will become available to trade with on Monday morning as I'm sure many other peoples will be too. 

You fucked yourself and your friends... as come Monday morning will be a whole lot more capital ready to be reivested in GME, AMC, NOK, BB and what ever the fuck other stocks I LIKE.

I LIKE THIS STOCK, I LIKE THIS COMPANY, I LOVE RYAN COHEN and FUCKING LOVE MY FELLOW RETARDS. We are not just lowly elite, we are the SUPER ELITE.

Edit 2: It seems some people are still asking if its too late to buy. I value this stock at $4206.90 and that's what I'm willing to walk away with. I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. With that being said... a life with out taking risks is a life having to wear a condom EVERY FUCKING TIME while you continually pound Melvin's Ass.

Edit 3: Next step.... we reached 320 this week and that was our target. Congrats all my fellow degenerates as we held the line. As you can see they are now offering up to 800 on next week's options. That's our next target. The squeeze could happen or it may not happen next week but we have a target in sight. They are trying to do everything in their power to suppress our valuation. Hold strong autists. We set the price. Prediction: GME opens Monday 500+ and we continue on our mission.

Edit 4: A lot of people are asking me questions about what happened. I was trading GME since Jan 11th as a broke ass bitch, I threw in $200 played a nice $26 call before we spiked to 32 I was excited and cashed out to turn that into 30 shares of GME and hedged my way up to 55 shares over the following weeks. Im not rich, I think I just played this right move.
Now here's what happened on Thursday... The Robinhood app blocked me from buying so my plan was to do a hedge on multiple platforms. Sell half on RH and rebuy after the inevitable ladder attack on my Webull account and then transfer my money there as well from RH. When I sold on RH they literally sold ALL of my shares not just my available shares since the others were locked up in limit sells. I panicked after that happened. And bought in as many as I could on my low funded Webull account. So I had to essentially sit out for the day. Friday full RH transfer hit my account and I set up a new account.
Atleast I sold at around 380 and was able to buy back in below that. I owe about 70k in medical debt and GME gave me a chance at making up some of that, I'm +25k on a $200 investment, I need this. You need this.

He put a short squeeze on the Vampire Squid. In 2006, Goldman Sachs GS, -1.40%  , as the great cephalopod is officially known, was shorting distressed high-yield bonds from a bathroom-fixtures manufacturer called MAAX Holdings Inc.

As a result, his total exposure exceeded the entire issue of the MAAX bonds. Falcone then stopped lending the bonds, so that short-sellers could not liquidate their positions anymore. The price of the bonds rose dramatically. The short-sellers could only liquidate their positions by contacting Falcone directly.

No, I wasn't paid by Melvin to deter your cause. I'm mostly looking for people to tell me why I'm wrong because all the posts I see are full of shit and are so overly emotional that they seem to lack any kind of logic. Everyone was saying there will be a short ladder attack before close, there wasn't. Everyone was saying there will be a gamma squeeze if we close over 320 and there wasn't. Friday was the first time when I didn't feel I understand what is actually happening - does anybody? Something feels off and we might even have been lead into a trap by Melvin or other hedge funds for them to recoup their losses, So please hear me out first.

(1) Public attention hit its maximum on Friday after being already extremely high on Thursday. It will likely subside rapidly next week especially if we have big dips.

(2) Most calls in the money were probably bought by people who actually don't have the funds to cover them. AH, suddenly 4 million shares were traded (after 40 million) for the whole day, the price dropped rapidly. IMHO what happened is that RH automatically liquidated 40k calls ITM because the holders didn't have enough funds to exercise them (i.e. for a $115 call you need 11500 in your account). This freed up the need to hedge those shares and they were immediately sold.

(3) Calls are now available up to 800 and they're actually not as expensive as you might think, so it's actually possible to hedge shorts quite effectively at this point. If the price doesn't hit $1000 soon, it will be very hard to squeeze. And we need to get there with buying shares only against people who can probably load up on shorts still and without the buying pressure of a squeeze and with considering (1).

(4) Short interest might still be 120%, but these are now people that shorted between 400 and 500 and are already hedged with let's say 600 calls.

(5) A squeeze to infinity would take down brokers and probably the entire market. Do you really believe this is going to happen? Don't be ridiculous. They can change the rules as they please and they did it before.

(6) There are two many players involved now. Before it was an easy story. One hedge fund fucked up their risk management and redditors fuck with them. Now you have people who just FOMOed in and actually have no clue about the underlying squeeze and gamma squeeze theory (because IMHO it actually doesn't work anymore). You have other hedge funds for which I don't know if they're actually going for the squeeze or just trying to get as much money from retailers piling in. What if they loaded up on short all the time around 330, then let the price fall to 250 and buy back in just to give the illusion that retailers still control the situation? To me the price movements look extremely professional, this IMHO is not retail driven anymore. Even if they go for the squeeze. What tells you that they will not be the only one capitalizing on it leaving retailers holding the bag? They know the game 100 times better than any of you and _will_ screw you over.

(7) We actually don't know who is short where and how it's hedged. Simple as that. Before it was Melvin shorted probably around 50 and in deep shit, now who the hell knows. We don't know if they actually covered. There's also dark pools btw. Just because volume was low is not a guarantee this didn't happen.

I thought about this long and hard. Here are IMHO the possible outcomes.

(A) People lose interest next week. The price will fall, people will panic sell. And a lot of you people will lose a lot of money you can't afford to lose. I feel extremely sorry about that because I really liked the movement.

(B) The government will intervene and offer $10k to every GME holder per share to resolve the situation. The money has to be paid by Melvin, regulations will change etc. I think this is highly unlikely as it feels unfair to the people not joining.

(C) The squeeze will go to infinity, each of you will be a billionaire and wallstreet will completely collapse together with the global stock market, because everyone in power who could have easily prevented it by just changing the rules will think it's time for a revolution and it would be unfair towards retailers to intervene. If you believe that, you are seriously retarded, and not in a good way.

(D) The price will keep going up a little bit, but it's not a squeeze. It's orchestrated by hedge funds to make their money back from all the people piling in believing they are still fighting although the battle is already lost. Once they realize, people lose interest the price goes to zero and people will lose everything.

(E) We will have more pressure and there's actually some squeezing going on. It could go to maybe 5000 before the government steps in, halts trading and most likely forces gamestop to dilute shares. Force because Gamestop really enjoys the attention and would draw a lot of hate doing this. But actually getting a lot of free money would probably be more attractive still, so they might do it even without being forced once they can negotiate a good deal with Melvin or whoever is interested to buy the shares at a reasonable price.

Don't get me wrong. I believe in the movement and I'm immensely proud of everyone showing immense solidarity fighting the right fight, just don't be only led by your emotions, also stop to think and add some logic.

I'm still long 100 shares, because I might be wrong, but I just feel after Friday the risk is significantly higher. Please safe, only invest what you're happy to lose (because this is the most likely outcome) and don't forget to try and understand what's actually happening.

Edit: After thinking even longer and harder I now realize that the total amount of shares is super low and that's right there a good *logical* argument why after all this might work. None of you idiots pointed this out to me though. Good luck everyone. I'll hold my remaining shares, now that I have more than just an emotional reason.

Here is what happened this week.

1. The week started with a big push into GameStop. GameStop is a company that by most accounts is/was struggling to build a profitable financial model. Their 52 Week low was $2.57 per share. Giving them a Market Cap of roughly $200 Million.
2. Melvin Capital, a Multi-Billion Dollar hedge fund has shorted the company (bet the stock will go down). In fact, somehow Melvin Capital has managed to allegedly short roughly 140% of the shares, borrowing more shares than are actually in existence. Side note: when you buy a stock, you can only lose the money you invested. However, when you short a stock your losses are theoretically infinite.
3. The extreme short position by Melvin Capital created a potential buying opportunity which was identified months ago by Reddit user DeepFuckingValue. If you can buy enough stock and options of a highly shorted company, the short seller (Melvin Capital) is forced to take losses. They may also need to rebuy shares to settle margin calls which can cause the stock to go up even more.
4. Over the past few months DeepFuckingValue's positions in GameStop have become something of legend, as the price went from his initial purchase price of around $5 per share, to opening the week at around $90 per share. Along the way both retail and institutional investors have gotten behind DFV and the short squeeze.
5. One famous investor who invested big behind DFV is the legend Michael Burry who you may know from The Big Short. He put a large buy position on and is rumored to have made well over $300 million.
6. By Tuesday night the stock is up HUGE closing the day around $145 per share
7. We enter what is known as a Gamma Squeeze this is a cascading effect that occurs when prices move up quickly against short sellers. Quick Analogy: If a short squeeze is fast like a Corvette, a Gamma Squeeze is fast like a Tesla in Plaid mode with a Space X Rocket booster strapped to it (we will get to Elon later).
8. Wednesday morning: ""We Like The Stock"". Stock moves to over $300 per share and closes the day over $350
9. The band of retail investors, Robinhood traders, and heavy hitters grows huge on the buy side. Elon Musk steps up, for those who don't know Elon, in addition to being the richest man in the world he also is likely not a huge fan of Melvin Capital as he went to battle with them when they tried to short sell Tesla
10. Melvin Capital's losses are reaching a point of potentially financially breaking their entire fund, allegedly, Citadel steps in to lend a few billion to help bail out Melvin Capital.
11. A Battle Cry is let out ""We can Stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent""
12. Thursday morning GameStop opens up to an insane upswing and hits over $450+ per share. DeepFuckingValue is man of lore as his initial $50k investment is now worth over $50m
13. Here is where things get dark...
14. At this point in time Robinhood and a few other brokerage houses stop allowing traders to buy GameStop. Betraying their own user base. They only allow you to hold or sell. Allegedly from many reports, Citadel who helped bail out Melvin Capital is actually one of the biggest customers of Robinhood. To better understand how this might have happened, Robinhood operates as a platform that allows traders trade commission free, but part of the business model is to then sells the data of how retail traders are trading to large institutional players like Citadel. In other words, if you are using the product for free you are the product and your data is being sold.
15. According to Justin Kan ""Citadel reloaded their shorts before they told Robinhood to stop trading GME""
16. GameStop Shares drop from $450+ per share to $130 per share in a matter of minutes as many traders literally are only able to sell.
17. The list of big players supporting GameStop erupts. Names include: AOC, Dave Portnoy, Mark Cuban, Elon Musk, and Chamath Palihapitiya all who are outraged by the events. Many call for the founders of Robinhood to face potential jail time.
18. WallStBets Reddit channel explodes to over 6 million users.
19. Shares climb back slightly on Thursday to end the day just under $200 a share
20. Friday opens with a big step up, Opening around $345. Robinhood allows some highly limited purchases of GameStop. Despite limitations, the share price holds closing the week at around $325 per share.
21. GameStop is now a $22 Billion company
22. DeepFuckingValue is on the front page of The Wall St. Journal.

It's very easy to get polarized and split groups down the middle, into ""us vs them."" While I agree that we stand united against abusive practices in the market, I don't think a majority of the people here have a proper appreciation of it.

**Short sellers are not the problem here.**
Short sellers are a necessary part of our markets, part of a ""healthy ecosystem"", if you will.
- Short sellers helped expose the housing credit fiasco banks were running that led to the 2008 crash, and if they hadn't, it could have ended up much worse. 
- Short sellers helped expose Valeant, a pharmaceutical company that was hiking the prices of live-saving drugs, because they knew people had no choice but to buy those drugs. 

In 2003, a statement was written to the SEC by James Chanos that further elaborates:

*""Many of the major corporate frauds and bankruptcies of the past quarter century were first exposed by short sellers doing fundamental research: Enron, Tyco, Sunbeam, Boston Chicken, Baldwin United, MicroStrategies, Conseco, ZZZZBest and Crazy Eddie are but a few examples of this phenomenon.""*
https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/hedgefunds/hedge-chanos.htm#:~:text=Many%20of%20the%20major%20corporate,few%20examples%20of%20this%20phenomenon.

We need short sellers.

üíé‚úãüíé‚úãüíé‚úã
**What we DON'T need are groups that artificially short a stock into oblivion through uncovered (naked) trading.**
üíé‚úãüíé‚úãüíé‚úã

That's what these hedge funds, and others, were doing. They wrote contracts agreeing to buy/sell a ton of shares at a certain price at a certain date... except they don't actually *have* the cash to be doing this with. What they were hoping to happen was keep the price down to ensure that the contracts would be profitable without ever needing to actually own the shares or have the cash to begin with.

And if you don't care about the cost of buying shares... then what's stopping you from just writing as many contracts as you want? Free money, right?

Well, they got caught with their pants down. Short interest on GME skyrocketed to 140%, and people sniffed something fishy reeeeaaal quick. Now, these firms are getting screwed because they'll be contractually obligated to buy the shares at whatever price we can sell them for.

In my mind, there's a powerful moral in this story for everyone here, especially newbies: **NEVER. SELL. NAKED. OPTIONS.** This should be *Trading Safety 101*.

Kids, if you want to sell a call option and collect that juicy premium money, you better own 100 shares of that company for when the piper comes calling. Likewise, if you want to sell a put option, you had better have enough cash to *actually buy* 100 of those shares at whatever price you picked.

Most brokers will enforce this on individuals, **but these firms and market makers are getting a pass, and I think it's time for that to end.** There wouldn't be any need for bailouts if people quit doing stupid shit, and if the executives responsible were actually held accountable (unlike 2008.)

Sincerely, some random Theta that just wants this whole thing to be over so I can get back to selling *covered* calls on my shares of BB, AMC, and so on, without waking up to find out they all jumped 1700% in one night. Sheesh.

Listen you retards. I will explain the logic of why GME needs AMC and AMC needs GME.

GME feels like a late ship for many. GME is not attractive to many people out there at this levels, just the commited ones. AMC is the second most shorted stock here with big hedge funds on the other side. Chartwise, they moved the same.


For GME to rocket, it needs AMC hype. People will want to get in at 15$/share now that the company is not bankrupt anymore and feels like a realistic fair valued company which was kept to the ground with shorts.


GME needs to hold it's own a bit until AMC loads up on people. 

GME is WSB short squeeze.
AMC is the rest of dumb retail short squeeze.

They both need the fomo and hype of each other to pull this through.

AMC might have even more support if you think about Hollywood and stuff like that and that it might get boomers interested in saving their memories from AMC.


TLDR:.  AMC NEEDS GME, GME NEEDS AMC.

BB, NOK are not short squeezes . End of story


Edit: if AMC was a diversion, they would have not limited the share at 1 as well. They are both fucking the shorts now that's why they limited both of them.


Edit: DONT FUCKING PULL OUT OF GME FOR AMC, WE NEED TO GET AMC GOING TO GET GME GOING, THATS WHAT I SAY



AMC

44.3m shares shorted last time was disclosed.

101m float

37% tutes ownership

That leaves around 60m float on market

44 out of 60 is over 70% short.

If they doubled down last week, we will see big moves coming

Let's call him Melvin. He thinks he's really smart. He finds a coupon for $5 off the new Nintendo Switch during the holidays with no limit on number of units. This is easy. I'll go ahead and sell the Switch now for $200 and then buy it for $195 with the coupon. Easiest $5 I'll ever make. He goes and tells all his parents' friends at the Citadel Country Club that he can get them the new Nintendo Switch for their kids. He collects $200 each from 200 parents. He now has $40K and will use that money to purchase Nintendo Switches for $39K. He'll have earned $1K in just a few hours. His parents will be so proud.

There's another kid watching Melvin this entire time. Let's call him Keith. Keith doesn't like Melvin. Keith is good friends with the guys over at Gamestop. He finds out that there are were only 100 new Switches shipped to the entire country. Keith and his 99 friends buy all 100 Nintendo Switches on the spot.

Later in the day, Melvin goes to Gamestop with his $5 off coupon and says, ""I'll take 200 Nintendo Switches please."" Gamestop guy looks at him and says, ""Sorry, we're all sold out."" Melvin goes to the next Gamestop. Same story. All sold out. He goes to all the Gamestops in the city and can't find a single Switch. He won't be able to fulfill the orders.

Meanwhile, Keith is telling all his friends about what Melvin promised the members at the Country Club. Nobody sell him the Nintendo Switch that you bought, no matter how much he offers you. Nobody likes Melvin, so everybody holds on to their Nintendo Switch.

Melvin is in trouble. His parents rich friends are all asking when they are getting their Nintendo Switch. Melvins parents are angry, but they don't want to lose their standing in the Citadel Country Club. They have to help Melvin gets 200 Nintendo Switches.

The price of Nintendo Switches in the city skyrockets. Melvins parents were able to get a few units from Keiths friends, but they had to pay really inflated prices for them, first $1,000, then $2,000, now $3,000. It's nearing Christmas, and every rich parent at the Country Club is desperate for the Nintendo Switch they promised their kids. They can't trust that Melvin will be able to get them one. They all start bidding against each other for Switches. Everybody in town is in on the action now. Everybody wants to get a Nintendo Switch to sell at the country club for $10,000.

What we know is that Q4 earnings report is coming. Cool. So what's the deal?

&#x200B;

Here's an interesting fact from recent Holiday Sales report:

>E-Commerce sales, which are included in comparable store sales, rose 309% and represented approximately 34% of total company sales, with total worldwide E-Commerce sales year to date  reaching over $1.35 billion, far exceeding the Company‚Äôs $1.0 billion growth objective.

# Do not underestimate this.

&#x200B;

We perceive this company not as a next Blockbuster, but as a next Netflix that can adapt to changing circumstances. GME's online sales are growing each and every quarter in a rapid pace.

This company is transitioning faster than you can correctly spell ""retard"" and we can help it accelerate to velocities of a fucking rocket ship.

&#x200B;

Did you know that GME has other brands under its shield?

From [gamestop.com/about-gamestop](https://gamestop.com/about-gamestop):

>The company's global family of brands include GameStop, EB Games, Micromania, ThinkGeek, and Game Informer magazine

I've broken out my robe, my pipe, and my helmet so that we can sit down and contemplate the most singular and engaging question of our time:

> If you were a short what would you do if you were SUPER fucked but you knew in two days you were going to be SUPER DUPER fucked? 

That's the question that we're faced with this fine Saturday morning. But let's do a quick review of the facts to understand where the shorts are possibly at before trying to answer that one.

**Current short situation**

* According to the DD floating around here we're still at 100% short interest - at least.
* Melvin and Shitron say they're out of their positions. But are they? 
* Doesn't matter. New shorts are still short and will be forced to cover. 
* We saw liquidity dry up Friday with a bid ask gap of like thousands at one point
* Shorts launched multiple short ladder attacks
* Reports of whales coming in an buying up the shorts shares during the attacks, short can't keep that up
* If shorts can't short attack because of the whales hoovering up their shares, what can they do? They have to buy eventually.
* ~~Oh and then there's the big gamma squeeze coming from Friday.~~ Ok looks like the gamma squeeze may have occurred [already](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8e9f3/read_this_if_you_expected_a_huge_gamma_squeeze/). Thanks to /u/BlueEstee for that DD - they definitely have more wrinkles on their lobes than me!
*~~All call contracts expired ITM Friday. Any naked calls must be covered. More importantly - MMs will be forced to gamma hedge existing contracts for further out expiration. They do this by buying shares.~~
* Retail is now buying out of spite. Which is the best kind of investing I think.
* I chew crayons. I put that together from what's here. If I did you know the shorts brokers did as well. Margin requirement increase anyone?

tl;dr shorts current situation

> They are SUPER DUPER fucked early next week because of the incoming gamma squeeze, likely increasing margin requirements, whales getting involved and of course continued retail interest.

Much of this is a summation of DD by /u/jkn_ku so read their post if you want a REALLY good blow-by-blow of Friday with some really keen insights on order flow sniping and things I had no fucking clue about: [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/).  I know, I know, /r/investing but goddamn if that isn't some killer DD and it reads like a fucking action thriller. Respect.

**But what's the shorts next move?**

The shorts have had a lot of tactics to scare off retail - ladder attacks, PR blitzs, lots of bots, etc. But they have ONLY ever had one move - the move they HAVE to make eventually. And that's of course to buy back the shares they owe their brokers. They're under contact to do so - it's the law.

But that's what will cause the MOASS and force them to buy from retail, right? That's what we want?

Yes! But there are other longs out there other than retail - institutional longs. These are usually big companies or funds who purchase gme for long term strategies. We haven't talked that much about them.

Here's a list and the amount of shares they own from an Investors.com [article](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/gme-stock-gamestop-investors-instantly-make-16-billion-gamestop-stock-squeeze/).

---|---|----|----|----|----
FMR (Fidelity Investments) |9.5 |13.7% |$3.0 |Sep-30-2020
Ryan Cohen |9.0 |12.9 |2.9 |Jan-10-2021
BlackRock |8.6 |12.3 |2.7 |Sep-30-2020
Vanguard Group |5.3 |7.6 |1.7 |Sep-30-2020
Susquehanna International Group |4.4 |6.3 |1.4 |Sep-30-2020

Senvest Management |3.6 |5.2 |1.2 |Oct-07-2020
Donald A. Foss |3.5 |5.0 |1.1 |Feb-28-2020
MUST Asset Management (SOLD STAKE!) |3.3 |4.7 |1.1 |Mar-18-2020

I want to be clear. Longs only represent 51.m shares. And many of these are funds that probably cannot sell due to their fund balancing requirements and what not (I don't know - just guessing there). 

Shorts are shorts AT LEAST 100% according to all of the DD we've read. They still have to buy ALL of retails shares. There is no way that I can see for them to avoid doing so. But they WILL try to lessen the pain. 

And these institutional longs are seeing BILLIONS in gains (with a B) so who knows what could happen.

So I am speculating that the shorts will approach institutional longs over the weekend for some sort of deal. So keep your eyes and ears open and helmets strapped on tight!

This is not investment advice. Don't take investment advice from the internet.

Positions: 1000 shares bought @ 16

APES TOGETHER STRONG.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the awards but please save your $ for gme shares. 

EDIT2: For those of you doubting the willingness of Longs to sell NOW to avoid more volatility, consider that a large gme shareholder - MUST - sold off their entire stake this [week](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/large-gamestop-shareholder-must-asset-management-sold-off-its-stake-2021-01-28).

**Position: I have around 14k shares across 2 brokers.**

[I lost shares to CCs if you compare to old SS. I also bought more at a much higher price.](https://preview.redd.it/q5uwj3sp5he61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc0889a25d38f6792fe185690f8f3fbb5289143b)

There are forces at play here that didn't exist during the VW squeeze. The gamma squeezes and sheer idiocy of option buying by you all has created a perfect storm which is what is created all the trading restrictions. There were going to be gamma squeezes every week until the short squeeze was triggered and no institution has the capital to handle weekly gamma squeezes. I think the restrictions has stopped the infinite gamma squeezes which is probably good for the market because it may have created a collapse and we could never buy chicken tenders again.

So back to timing the MOASS and when to sell.  
1. üíéüëê  
2. I firmly believe you can't time it anymore. The institutions are much more advanced now and the short ladder attacks which we saw multiple times this week and in 2020 creates artificial drops that make it look the bottom is falling out of the squeeze. (i.e., stop loss is bad)  
3. They are obviously willing to lose ridiculous amounts of money borrowing shares because they don't want to ""lose"" to a bunch of internet üêí.   
4. This isn't Porsche owning all the shares. Whatever they say, none of us really know what any of us are going to do. We certainly can't coordinate buying or selling because we would have all bought with DFV. So we may see spikes from a hedge fund covering after short ladder attacks or PM/AH trading. We won't know if any of these spikes are the MOASS.  
5. They made this a war of us vs them. This is personal now for a lot of us and we are willing to hold much longer than any rational person would. Some people will probably hold through the squeeze and fall and witness the rebirth of GME by Ryan Cohen and see the shares go back to $100-$300 on its own. **The original thesis**.  
6. Watch the volume. The short ladder attacks occurred during low volume. Volume will sky rocket during the MOASS and even during the ride back down volume will be high. This is black Friday when the doors open and boomer Karens are climbing on top of each other to buy a tickle me Elmo.  
7. Gamestop step in during the squeeze and announce they are going to bail out the shorters.  
8. They are taking advantage of ladder attacks and trading halts.  
9. Without the gamma pressure from options, we may see the stock price drop significantly after they cover from this past week.  
10. We don't know the price point for the shorters anymore. There could be a significant amount of shorters with price points above $100.  
11. **HOLY SHIT THE PUTS!!!! I just totaled the puts for next week. \~149,000 puts from $0.50 to $100. 8,359 puts from $100 to $320. These are all OTM.** There are a lot of puts that are OTM every week in February.

**My Plan**: I'm exercising all my options (vary between $15-$30 strikes) now because I'm worried about lack of buyers/liquidity and stability of the trading platforms for retail during a MOASS. I'm going to adjust when I sell based on what is going on because there has been too much fuckery. I imagine I will sell a large percentage of my stocks between $1000 and $2000, but we could just as easily see a sudden spike from $900 to $2000 in a 5 minute window and then I probably won't sell till over $5000. If we slowly increase over days and weeks (10%-50%) my tolerance to hold will increase and my sell points will adjust.

I think we all need to be prepared for what other shenanigans these types will come up with next week. Here's what I can think of:

1. Some brokers will continue imposing limits on certain securities (what you can buy, how much you can buy, and so on). This will continue to suppress demand.

2. SEC may get involved and [suspend trading for 10 days](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/suspensions.htm) ""for the protection of investors"". This will have an impact on holders of near-dated options. I am most worried about this.

3. Technical outage. There are billions of dollars at stake here (trillions if the stock market collapses), so what's a few ""outages"" that will ease volatility and cool sentiments?

4. Continued short ladder attacks by the shorts. We've all seen this again and again this week.

*****
> Earnings news from Amazon and Alphabet, the important January jobs report and Washington‚Äôs discussion of stimulus could all be important to markets in the week ahead, but none of it is likely to get more attention than the short squeezes driven by retail investors.
*****
> Stocks had a rocky week, with the S&P 500 down 3.3% to 3,714. The S&P was down 1.1% for January, its first negative month since October and a warning for the year, according to the old Wall Street adage.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe were due for some type of decline. We‚Äôve been straight up since October. It‚Äôs not unusual that we‚Äôre backing off a bit,‚Äù said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities.
*****
> Trading could remain bumpy in the coming week, as the S&P 500 struggles to hold above 3,716 its 50-day moving average and a key technical level.
*****
> ‚ÄúThis is the first time we‚Äôre at the 50-day moving average since early November,‚Äù said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a level we haven‚Äôt seen in a while and it‚Äôs an important first line in the sand of whether the market uses this as a pivot spot to bounce again.‚Äù
*****
> ‚ÄúThe buy the dip mentality doesn‚Äôt die easy, but if you break that [50-day], that portends something else,‚Äù he said.
*****
> Massocca and others see little impact on the broader market from the phenomena of retail investors piling into stocks that are being shorted by big investors. Fueled by no fee trading, retail investors created a flurry of trading in GameStop and other heavily shorted names, like AMC Entertainment. If the stocks rise, in theory, the firms that are short sellers will have to buy stock to cover, and that activity could drive the price even higher in a so-called short squeeze.
*****
> GameStop was the poster child for that trade this past week. GameStop shares closed 68% higher on Friday, bringing their gain for the week to 400%. The retailer‚Äôs shares hit a high of $483 on Jan. 28.
*****
> ‚ÄúThis is somewhat isolated,‚Äù Massocca said of trading in GameStop and other shorts. He said it may not be a phenomena for that long since there aren‚Äôt that many heavily shorted stocks. ‚ÄúI think they may be hunting new names.‚Äù
*****
> The short squeeze story has garnered broad interest, in the general news media and from Washington.
*****
> Lawmakers from both parties are eager to look into the fact that Robinhood and other online brokers restricted trading in the hottest short names when trading was frenzied. Robinhood said it was responding to SEC rules on net capital requirements and clearinghouse deposits that brokers have to comply with.
*****
> ‚ÄúThis was the busiest week for earnings reported with 82% of the companies reported better than expected earnings. It‚Äôs a really good quarter, but obviously overshadowed by the short squeeze news,‚Äù said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management.
*****
> He said some of the biggest tech names have been lagging, like Apple and Microsoft.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe combination of demanding valuations and short squeeze news has overshadowed a really good performance of corporate earnings so far,‚Äù Grohowski said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre constructive on the market. Fundamentals do look encouraging to us.‚Äù
*****
> Strategists have expected a pullback in the first part of the year, and many say it would become a buying opportunity. Hedge funds did sell long positions in the past week, but firms like Morgan Stanley and Barclays say the de-leveraging is not likely to have a big impact on stocks.
*****
> But for investors who end up buying in at the end of the short squeezes, they could feel some pain.
*****
> ‚ÄúI do think this isn‚Äôt going to end well,‚Äù said Grohowski. ‚ÄúThese kind of one way trades they don‚Äôt end well particularly for those that come later to the party.‚Äù
*****
> ‚ÄúI think this will be one of those,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGameStop is not worth what it is trading for today. I do believe at the end of the day the value of a company is important and it‚Äôs going to be driven by fundamentals.

> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve wanted for some time for this younger generation to be more interested in the financial markets and equity investing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI know a lot of experienced market participants were not anticipating it being this way. It‚Äôs not just a one time kind of distortion.

> # How Stocks Perform in a President‚Äôs First Year

> 2021 kicks off the first year of a new four-year presidential cycle. One of the most popular questions we‚Äôve received lately is how have stocks performed historically during this political year.

> For starters, the S&P 500 Index historically has gained 6.8% per year during the first year of the four-year presidential cycle, but stocks have done better when the president was re-elected than when someone new occupied the White House. This makes sense, as a new president could bring new policies and potential uncertainty. Additionally, stocks do better during years three and four under a new president, while they are much weaker early in the cycle.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, breaking down all the quarters of the four-year presidential cycle shows that the first quarter of the first year in the cycle is one of only two quarters with a negative average return.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Bigger picture, historically the fourth quarter of the year has been the strongest of the year, with the first quarter the second best on average. Don‚Äôt forget, the third quarter is usually a weak one. Please note, below is for all years, not just the first year of the cycle.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> We will take a closer look at February returns next week on the blog, but it is worth noting that when a new party is in power in the White House, historically stocks have struggled from late January until early March. ‚ÄúIt is interesting, but from around the time of the inauguration to several weeks out, stocks tend to be pretty weak,‚Äù according to LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúIt may be as simple as new leadership could bring with it new policies and added uncertainty‚Äù.

> # Will GameStop Stop The Bull Market?

> ‚ÄúIn the short term, the market is a popularity contest. In the long term, the market is a weighing machine.‚Äù -Warren Buffett

> The incredible action from some of the most heavily shorted names has investors everywhere wondering what it all means? GameStop (GME) specifically has taken the country‚Äôs imagination by storm, as the stock started the year under $20 per share and this morning nearly hit $500.

> Please note, we aren‚Äôt allowed to discuss individual equities, and in no way are we recommending any stocks in this blog, but from a bigger perspective, what is happening here? Basically, individual investors are using message boards like Reddit to find some of the most shorted stocks, then they all pile in at the same time, forcing large institutions to cover their shorts, and thus producing massive buying pressure.

> LPL Research doesn‚Äôt think these parabolic moves reflect an overall unhealthy market, but institutions covering shorts at sizable losses may be removing capital from some big cap names. ‚ÄúWhile these developments could be another sign of excessive optimism in certain segments of the equity markets, we do not believe they represent a sign of a broader market bubble or indicate a major correction is forthcoming,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget, overall market breadth is extremely healthy and the credit markets are functioning just fine‚Äîwe don‚Äôt see a repeat of 1999 like some are claiming.‚Äù

> Lastly, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, after a 72% rally in the S&P 500 Index (and more in small caps and the Nasdaq), maybe it is simply time for a break. After all, the current bull market has tracked almost perfectly the start of the 1982 and 2009 bull markets thus far, and both of those took a break for a few months starting around this point in the cycle.

> # Most Heavily Shorted Stocks at the End of 2020 and Now

> In the table below, we show the 20 stocks in the Russell 3000 that currently have the highest short interest as a percentage of float. It should come as no surprise that GameStop (GME) still tops that list with 122.97% of float short as of the most recent data for mid-month. That is even after a 21.36 percentage point drop from the end of 2020 when 144.34% of shares were short. It was also the most heavily shorted stock then. The runner-up is Dillard's (DDS) which currently has 83.04% of shares sold short compared to over 90% at the end of 2020. Again, despite that sizeable decline in the percentage of shares sold short, it was also the second most heavily shorted stock one month ago. Of the rest of the top 20, there are six other names with lower short interest than the end of last year. Looking across the rest of the most heavily shorted stocks, Sumo Logic (SUMO), American Well Corp (AMWL), and Sunpower (SPWR) are the stocks that have seen their short interest as a percentage of equity float rise the most. In terms of stock price performance, SPWR has been the one with the biggest rally having doubled YTD. The only other stock that has doubled YTD in this cohort has been GME.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012921-Short-2.png))**

> In the table below, we show the stocks that have seen the biggest changes in the percent of shares sold short between the end of 2020 and the most recent data as of January 15th. Those currently in the top 20 most shorted stocks are highlighted in gray. Across the entire Russell 3,000, 1,777 stocks have seen their short interest as a percent of short move lower in the two week period from the end of December to mid-January. As shown, even after the massive short squeeze that has taken place, GME is actually not the stock that has seen the biggest decline in shorts. Relay Therapeutics (RLAY) holds that title with a 22.62 percentage point decline. That is even though the stock has experienced a relatively smaller move than some of its peers. Granted, a number of other stocks like nCino (NCNO) and Berkeley Lights (BPYU) to name a few have actually moved lower so far in 2020 and have also seen their short interest decline significantly. On the other end of the spectrum, WW International (WW) has seen its short interest rise the most.

> # Funding Markets Full of Cash

> US funding markets are awash with liquidity thanks to ongoing QE purchases by the Fed and the progression of fiscal policy since the end of the year, as well as normal seasonal tailwinds that see more liquidity after year-end balance sheet constraints would roll off. Funding markets refer to collateralized, short-term lending via repo and related wholesale cash transactions.

> Government money market funds that are allowed to conduct repo operations as well as buying Treasury and Agency debt are seeing roughly typical inflows, but those come on top of record share of overall money market funds. As a result, repo rates have been plunging. The secured overnight financing rate, which tracks the volume-weighted general collateral repo rate has fallen to 3 basis points above the bottom of the Fed Funds target range. While repo rates falling below the Fed Funds target range wouldn‚Äôt be a catastrophe and some parts of the market have gotten there, it‚Äôs not in the FOMC‚Äôs interest to have funding rates trading far outside its target policy rate range on a regular basis.

> The solution already exists, of course: the NY Fed has a standing overnight reverse repo facility first introduced back in 2013 which is likely to start draining cash as investors seek higher returns than the repo markets offer. Reserve scarcity, which roll-off brought to bear in 2018 and 2019, is now reserve plenty, and so many reserves exist that the NY Fed will start draining them with reverse repos. Reserve balances will continue to grow this year thanks to QE purchases and an expected decline in the balance of the federal government's transaction account at the Federal Reserve.

> # Federal Reserve Rebukes Hawkish Rumors; Reaffirms Support

> It has been a busy past 12 months for the Federal Reserve (Fed), after the onset of the global pandemic prompted historic stimulus from monetary policymakers. With the economy showing signs of being in the early stages of expansion, some have speculated that the Fed may begin to slow the pace of its asset purchases. Recent comments from some Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members that have hinted that the Fed‚Äôs bond buying program could be reduced by the end of the year, has signaled that other policymakers may be thinking that way, too.

> Adding fuel to the speculation, the 10-year Treasury yield has been climbing, breaking above 1% for the first time since March 2020 as the economy has expanded. Meanwhile, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, breakeven inflation rates‚Äîthe yield difference between Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and nominal Treasuries‚Äîhave risen to levels not seen since 2018, suggesting that inflation expectations are heating up, although levels still remain largely benign.

This [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8bwtx/why_gme_fundamentals_dont_matter_for_gme_stock/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) explains how you're not just buying $GME when you buy their stock. You're also buying a stake in all the hedgies shorting it. 

Then this [second post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8hxs6/burning_questions_on_gme_no_one_in_sec_will_answer/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) explains how it's not just the hedgies shorting $GME. There's a big bank backing the hedgies; like a too-big-to-fail big bank (TBTFBB).

So all these CNBC boomers taking about $GME fUnDaMeNtAlS are just fucking with us. Here's what's probably the truth (THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. I'M NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. AM RETARDED): 

Since more shares of $GME are sold short than actually exist (~110-120%), we're getting a 10-20% discount on a TBTFBB, AND GameStop's business. This applies at ANY share price as long as the shorted shares exceed existing shares. This assumes there's a TBTFBB backing the hedgies, that the squeeze is successful, and that we sell when the squeeze occurs. In other words, our investment is backed by the fucking US Government.

In game theory, the only way you could have maximized your gains was if you all stuck together, and you did! They had counted on you guys scattering, and that‚Äôs why they took out new shorts on GME.

GME was on the cusp of a short squeeze on Wednesday, before they closed off all buying, and did the short ladder attack.

It shows that they‚Äôve learned nothing since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). They play by one primary rule: Heads we win. Tails you lose. And they can change the other rules last minute to drive to the primary rule.

Next, they will try to block/limit buying across RH and more brokerages so there‚Äôs not enough volume to drive to the short squeeze. Meanwhile Hedge Funds are free to buy/sell unlimited amount of shares and create short ladder attacks \[1\]. Different rules for different players in this game!

But let‚Äôs move back to the whiteboard.

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch.*

Today, I‚Äôll describe what a margin call is and explain a High Short Interestt trading strategy around it. In Particular, I‚Äôll use Melvin Capital presumed short book as a case study.

Note: I‚Äôm not a financial advisor, this is just me whiteboarding.

# Long/Short Strategy

In the Hedge Fund industry they have a strategy called long/short. They go long on momentum stocks and short undesirable ones.

Ie buying Apple and shorting Gamestop.

This trade is profitable if Apple‚Äôs stock price rises and Gamestop‚Äôs (GME) share price decline.

However, let say the trade doesn‚Äôt go their way and Gamestop share prices dramatically because of a short squeeze. In this case their net position is negative. Let‚Äôs say 30% negative. If it becomes large, their brokers calls them up and ask them to put more cash. Then they raise 30% more cash or sell stocks that been paid off to meet the reserve requirement. This is why you see the general stock market deep red, while GME moons. Hedge funds are selling their winning longs to raise cash for the margin requirement.

When GME short squeezes, they may have to liquidate (sell off all their longs) and cover their existing short position. Moreover, they have other leverage short positions that are also highly shorted (> 50% of the float). This becomes what‚Äôs known as an arbitrage trade. I‚Äôll call it the High Short Interest (HSI) Trade. It‚Äôs a high risk trade but with potential for very high profits/returns should it go someone's way.

# The High Short Interest Trade

Should Hedge funds start to cover short positions because of a margin call or liquidate, they will be forced to buy up shares in the open market. However, if those shares are scares, it will create a huge short squeeze in which they will have to pay higher prices to meet their obligation to return shares.

I‚Äôll use Melvin Capital as a case study because they have publicly declared they had a high short interest in GME, so most likely be margin called or liquidiated, should the GME short squeeze happen.

Furthermore, I‚Äôll analyze their possible short position to justify why the squeeze may happen. Again, this is all conjecture and thinking out a possible trading strategy

In this case study, a high short interest stock is defined as one in which the short interest is greater than 50%. The reason why we will focus on these stock is because of the difficult of buy back all the shares before the market discovers how these shares are valuable because you have to buy them back at any price to meet contractual obligations.

Going forward, everything I write is based on conjecture but backed up by evidence. Shorting is a opaque dark art and it‚Äôs hard to get concrete data. But it shouldn‚Äôt block us in this whiteboarding session.

Here is a Melvin Capital possible short interest based on their sec filing of put positions \[2\]

1. Gamestop (GME)
2. AMC Networks (AMC)
3. Dillards (DDS)
4. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)
5. The Macerich Company (MAC)
6. Tanger Factory Outlet Center (SKT)

I‚Äôll analyze short interest based on data from ortex.com \[3\]. Ortex data is shown in the imgur links. This data is not confirmed but estimate and such has a possibility for high errors. However, ortex has been very reliable in the past.

**AMC**

[https://imgur.com/a/s48vgAV](https://imgur.com/a/s48vgAV)

Estimate Short Interest: 63M

Float: 102M

% of float shorted 62%

**Dillards (DDS)**

[https://imgur.com/a/smZwIeB](https://imgur.com/a/smZwIeB)

Estimate Short Interest: 4.2M

Float: 5.5M

% of float shorted: 76%

Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY)

[https://imgur.com/a/DI18mYL](https://imgur.com/a/DI18mYL)

Estimate Short Interest: 58M

Float: 109M

% of float shorted: 54%

**MAC**

[https://imgur.com/a/JpXcPrP](https://imgur.com/a/JpXcPrP)

Estimate Short Interest: 71M

Float: 113M

% of float shorted: 63%

**SKT**

[https://imgur.com/a/mcyDYuE](https://imgur.com/a/mcyDYuE)

Estimate Short Interest: 48M

Float: 90M

% of float shorted: 53%

As you can see all these positions are heavily shorted, and should this hedge fund need to acquire shares of them on the market because of liquidation, it may have trouble to close out its short position. Hence, a very high likelihood of a short squeeze.

# Short Ladder Attack

A common maneuver Hedge fund deploy to vacuum up shares is a short ladder attack \[1\]. They do this to drop the price and scoop up shares. For hedge funds with big short positions this is effective because it makes it seem like the shares aren‚Äôt valuable when they are.

Usually, they will borrow 1-3% of shares and short, causing people to panic sell. If they do this repeatedly after like 10 days, they can close out 30% of their short position before the market notices. Do you see now how they can leverage 1% to scoop up 30% of the shares with this attack? It‚Äôd be difficult for them to vacuum up all the shares at once without the price increasing or the market knowing, so they manipulate the price lower and do it over a period of time.

That is why you‚Äôll see the days to cover metric. Based on the volume, it suggest how many days they can get away with this before they are whole. However, should people realize that their short interest is too high, they can HOLD and buy more to force hedge funds to buy the shares at a higher price.

But you can see that the volume is increasing, so the market is aware of a potential short squeeze.

# Short Squeeze Precedent

In the week of March 20, 2020, Blue Apron had a short interest of about 50%. And then they experienced a short squeeze which led the price to climb 1000% in a week. So you can see how explosive the share price can climb, should a short squeeze occur, for stocks with a short interest of 50% or greater.

Never trade more than you‚Äôre willing to lose. Diamond hands.

1. Create Robinhood app to get a lot of fresh money into the market, and blatantly use the data on that fresh money to always stay ahead of those lowly 'retail' traders

1. That creates a class divide in the market that is easy to discern because it's largely just people on robinhood. at least enough to use to manipulate the market

1. Due to this easy divide, the hegies ensure the game already has fail-safes they can use to minimize their risk in a situation where they are squeezed. 

1. (here's the fun one) When the tits on their scheme do in fact go up and they get squeezed, they create a single very bad actor to put all the blame on. Robinhood can't be subject to regulatory actions if they are already bankrupt from class action suits. or vice versa. Robinhood was enough of those lowly 'retail' investors that they could use it to manipulate the market with it and then sacrifice that one company and still get off. 



You have to wonder how much of that was always the plan. Was robinhood always nothing more than a setup to take our money and protect them from being squeezed?

1. We worship at the feet of gods larger than men (u/deepfuckingvalue) and ask for their guidance when going gets tough

2. We congregate in the same place every day (r/wallstreetbets) to worship and to spend time with those who share our beliefs

3. We commit sins (selling) and are forgiven by those who see through our paper hands to the strength within to overcome and rectify our sins (buy the mf dip)

4. We believe in a righteous cause and go to war to protect our beliefs and fight for what we believe is right (down with the hedgies)

5. We follow a strict set of commandments in order to stride the path to enlightenment (like the stock, hold, buy dips, inform the newbies, downvote bots)

This sharing of information is not illegal or any type of market manipulation, since it is all true to the best of our knowledge at the time the statements were made (the data we can access says the short interest has been over 100% of the float for a long time now). It is not illegal for one investor to inform another investor about truthful (or perceived truthful) information. 

From there, many investors simultaneously made the decision that it was in their best interest financially to buy GME stock in the hopes of triggering a VW like squeeze. 

Example: when this hit mainstream news, a friend called me and said ‚Äúexplain short squeezes like I am five and why GME has the potential to be one‚Äù. So I (a semi-experienced investor) did so to the best of my ability, whilst disclosing that I am currently holding GME shares. This individual then made his OWN decision to invest a significant portion of his portfolio hoping to at least double his money. 

We have also spread the information that, the less people sell, the worse position that puts the short sellers of this stock into trouble. From there, people have made their own decisions. Those of us that think enough people will hold to trigger a larger squeeze are holding while some people have sold thinking the squeeze was already over. 

Again, we are not colluding in secret to agree to buy/hold a certain amount of shares together. No one knows how many GME shares we (the retail investors discussing this) collectively own. We are just spreading information about what CAN happen if investors behave in a certain way and people are rationally choosing simultaneously hold/buy from there, which appears like collusion.

Edit: disclaimer that I still hold GameStop shares.

We were on the brink of a Bear Stearns moment. Basically, these funds were so leveraged that many of them were blowing up, and it threatened to take down the entire market with it.

&nbsp;


TLDR; Had the ""FREE MARKET"" remained free this would have caused a massive systemic crash due to forced deleveraging of hedge funds.

&nbsp;

**Understanding Leverage:**

Many people don't quite understand the game that goes on between these big funds and the market. These big hedge funds are leveraged up so say Melvin Capital has 12 Billion in AUM (Assets under management) they are likely leveraged up 5-10x meaning they actually own stock positions worth 60-120 Billion. If enough hedge funds blow up at once, the whole system collapses because they are forced to sell longs and deleverage. This is what happened in 2008, and these guys saw it happening again.

&nbsp;

**The entire market was at systemic risk.**


They had no out so they changed the game. The clearing firms, and Depository Trust Company suddenly changed the entire margin requirements for every ""meme"" stock. Basically when you buy a stock normally your broker has to give a clearing firm 2% of the collateral of the stock price, and the trade is matched with a seller/buyer and sent to a firm like DFT who then records you as the new owner of that share of stock.

&nbsp;


**Changing collateral requirements suddenly**


Well guess what they changed the collateral requirement to 100% yes you are correct they changed it to **100%**. This FORCED many brokers to not allow buys on the stock. This is the true culprit behind whats going on. ***The Citadel*** was at risk of blowing up which means big banks like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs were gonna take heavy losses. This would cause a massive market pullback probably between 15-20%. They COULD NOT let this happen. You think President Biden wants to watch the stock market blow up on his second week in office?

&nbsp;

**A coordinated attack on retail investors:**

I have never ever seen the level of manipulation that existed on Thursday and Friday. These funds are all on the brink of collapse so they cut off access to over 95% of the people from buying, and forced sells or hit stop losses on every single open position. Interactive Brokers HAD been my broker for many years, and I had promoted them for ages. Watching their Chairman Thomas Peterffy say we will stop trading UNTIL these stocks return to a reasonable price angered me to my core. You run a broker firm YOU DO NOT DECIDE THE PRICE OF A STOCK PERIOD. This was a coordinated takedown of the young retail investor who was on the verge of a HUGE win.

&nbsp;


**Where stocks would have ended the week causing a market blowup:**

So what is the real price these meme stocks would have ended up at you ask.

$GME 1000


$BB    50


$AMC  30


$NOK  12

I am not taking it anymore ....... Seriously I am fucking done

Yesterday I started looking over everything I have sold the last 20 years. NVDA at 120 due to the Citron short, AAPL 90 pre split due to all the sell side analysis saying over extended, over priced, and the list just goes on and on. ISRG which was one of my favorites of all time I sold at 18. Now they limit the amount of shares I can buy in a company. I realize this has been talked about non stop on this sub, but I am going to actually start doing something about it.

Starting on Monday I am going to liquidate my 401k and every other stock I have besides GME (500k). I don't care if this market moons or falls apart, but I want change. Change so these giant funds can't manipulate the market the way they want. Change so that the playing field is leveled and I am not going back until this happens. Maybe if enough people really start to pull out we can finally start sending a real message.

In regards to GME I like the stock, and going forward I want to buy more. If I die on this hill then so be it, but it's the last time I get manipulated.  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

In addition I have money going to brokerages that can't restrict what I buy. It will be there on Monday

Edit 1: I am not cashing out my 401k to stick it into GME. I am cashing out and letting it sit in a money market for a while. Same with all my other accounts. No I am not going to withdraw my 401k just let it sit in a money market for a while.

Before, the shady activity of the brokerages was hidden from the general public. They were able to manipulate the markets all they wanted and get away with it because the ""commoners"" didn't care or understand. 

Now, with millions of retain investors that flooded the market, a shift in ""market influence"" in favor of smaller, amateur traders. And the gargantuan, amorphous investment firms didn't like that at all. 

It has become a battle of market influence, and the hedge funds and brokerages with massive amounts of capital are doing WHATEVER IT TAKES (illegal or not) to make sure that they retain that authority that they previously held for so many years. (flooding certain stocks with short positions, disabling certain stocks)

But with investment firms taking blatant illegal action to accomplish their goals, their shady activity has been revealed for the world to see and it seem as of now, that the general public, as well as some democrat lawmakers have taken an interest to them. (It also shows how corrupt the SEC is with them taking their sweet time to decide which side they want to be on)

The economy might take a hit, that is true, but it won't end with the economy collapsing as we know it. 

The problem is that hedge funds are facing unlimited loss, and may be forced to buy at any price us ü¶ç ask for.

#HOWEVER


At some point, as has happened to pretty much all short squeezes,


##Gamestop will offer shares to the shorts at some point. 


They already have a 100m dollar offer lined up, but they could easily offer more. Why would they do this? Because it would make them a fuck ton of money. 

At the end of the day, Gamestop is a business. They are in the midst of a huge transition, and the ability to clear debt and have more cash on hand during this time would be life changing money for this company. AMC did it this past week, it happened during the VW squeeze when
Porsche offered stock and made a fortune. Gamestop will likely do the same thing. They'd be absolutely stupid not too. 


What does this mean? Well, it means that your 69420 per share probably isn't going to happen, but I still expect a big ol squeeze is in the works. Just be prepared for this type of announcement, and when the dust settles let's make sure we continue to support the company.

Article from the FT:

The crucial role played by clearing houses in financial markets has been thrust into the spotlight after contentious moves by US brokers such as Robinhood and Charles Schwab to restrict retail investors‚Äô bets on stocks at the heart of the Reddit-fuelled trading boom.

Customers reacted angrily on Thursday as brokers moved to stop them opening new positions in certain red-hot stocks, accusing them of unfair treatment or even a Wall Street establishment plot. But the brokers gave a more mundane explanation: the extra volatility in share prices meant they had to hold more capital at the institutions that clear their trades.

What do clearing houses do?
These unobtrusive venues normally sit in the background of daily market activity but they can become the centre of attention during periods of volatility when they require more cash ‚Äî or ‚Äúmargin‚Äù ‚Äî from their members to ensure that deals are honoured as customers expect.

An equities trade that has been executed can take up to two days to be legally settled, creating a risk of it failing if either side of the trade defaults. A clearing house stands between the two sides to manage the risk to the market if that happens.

Each day members of the clearing house, which range from small brokers like Robinhood to big Wall Street banks such as JPMorgan and Citigroup, are required to put up margin as insurance for their trades.

The amount is calculated by the clearing house and is based on the amount of trading carried out by each member, as well as the volatility of the individual securities traded. Margin is generally collected at the start of the trading day, although there can be intraday calls in frenzied periods, in an attempt to protect the wider market from sudden trade failures.

The clearing member often has limited time to make up the shortfall and the margin typically has to be an asset that is highly liquid, such as cash, US government bonds or shares. In the middle of the market volatility last March, one US bank was required to find $9.6bn of margin for derivatives trades within an hour.

How do brokers such as Robinhood fit into this?
In common with rivals such as Schwab and ETrade, Robinhood clears its own trades and is a member of the main US equities clearing house, run by DTCC.

While self-clearing saves on the fees that would otherwise go to another clearing broker, it also means Robinhood takes on the risk that an executed trade does not settle, and needs to have more cash on hand to cover shortfalls. It also faces higher costs if the clearing house raises margin requirements in volatile periods to protect against a member default. 

‚ÄúThe extreme volatility is a big factor behind this,‚Äù said Andy Nybo, managing director at Burton-Taylor International Consulting. ‚ÄúThey need to make sure they are able to meet cash requirements, whether it is for clearing or to investors that are owed money due to trading activity.‚Äù

As Robinhood said in a blog post on Thursday, the requirements ‚Äúcan be substantial in the current environment.‚Äù It declined to comment further.

Between Wednesday and Thursday, the margin call from DTCC across the US equities market rose from $26bn to $33.5bn, the clearing house confirmed.

DTCC said the frenzied trading in shares such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment ‚Äúgenerated substantial risk exposures at firms that clear these trades‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâparticularly if the clearing member or its clients are predominantly on one side of the market.‚Äù

How did brokers respond?
Safety mechanisms built into the market‚Äôs infrastructure across Wall Street led to periodic halts in trading activity on Thursday. In order to ensure they had enough money to cover margin and capital requirements, Robinhood and others such as Schwab and TD Ameritrade raised margin for trading on some of the names at the heart of the volatility, which required more cash be set aside after each trade.

This limited its margin needs from escalating further. By allowing users to close positions, it was still permitting trades that would reduce its immediate need for cash.

Robinhood also raised the margin requirements for customers that had not paid for the total value of their trading up front, having cut its margin requirements in December in an attempt to drive more trading activity. That meant some customers suddenly needed to come up with cash to cover trades.

Behind the scenes, Robinhood moved to raise a fresh $1bn in capital from its existing investors, which it announced ahead of trading on Friday. The company said the fundraising was a ‚Äústrong sign of confidence from investors that will help us continue to further serve our customers‚Äù.

Anthony Denier, chief executive of Webull, another company that was forced to restrict trading in some shares, said in an interview with Yahoo Finance that its clearing firm ‚Äúsimply could not afford‚Äù the cost of entering into new trades.

‚ÄúThis has nothing to do with a decision or some sort of closed, cigar smoke filled room of Wall Street firms getting together to the dismay of the retail trader,‚Äù he said.

Simpler Explanation from Comments 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

RH and other similar execution firms have to post collateral with the DTCC every time a position is opened. This collateral is to protect the DTCC in the event of the market moving against the position between the time of execution and the time the trade settles (T+2) AND the execution firm failing to settle the trade by being unable to come up with the cash (in the case of a purchase) or the shares (in the case of a sale). 

When a share is particularly volatile, the DTCC will up the collateral requirements it imposes on both buyer and seller. When the trade does finally settle the collateral is returned.

RH and other execution firms are prohibited from using client funds for this purpose, which must remain in a segregated account until settlement is finalised. Even if RH decline to allow margin trading on certain volatile stocks, insisting that buyers stump up the full purchase price, this money cannot be used for the 2 day period when RH has to post collateral. If RH executed a sell order during this period, that would reduce DTCC's risk and allow it to return collateral to RH rather than ask for more. This collateral could be re-used by RH, allowing it to make another purchase on behalf of a client. This is why RH could accept sell orders nut not buy orders periodically. Once it had executed enough sell orders, which freed up collateral, it could then offer to accept buy orders, until the collateral ran out again. This is why the blocks on buy orders were periodic - they hit their collateral limit, so stopped accepting buy orders. They executed sell orders which freed up collateral (and collateral was returned as trades settled), allowing them to offer buy orders agin, until the collateral limit was hit again, when they had to once again suspend buy orders. etc etc

And ran out, it did. RH's business model is based on a steady stream of small orders on both the buy sand sell side. If it is executing both buys and sells consistently over time, as far as DTCC is concerned it has very little risk to RH so doesn't need to ask for much collateral to be posted. Hence RH had never planned for a situation where it would be asked to post large quantities of collateral (potentially $billions).

So, it ran out of collateral that it would need to post for buy orders, but sell orders would free up collateral. It arranged a convertible bond issue with existing shareholders that raised $500m immediately, and hopefully another $500m in a few days and it drew down on a loan facility it had with its banks. But still not enough. 

The issue RH (and others experienced) is the ridiculously long time it still takes to settle trades (it could be more or less immediate) and the rules that prevent it using client funds as collateral (if settlement was immediate, the client funds wouldn't remain in the segregated account, but would be used immediately to settle the trade).

But it is what it is. If RH wants to execute trades it has to be able to put up the collateral. If it doesn't have the collateral, it can't execute trades (at least the trades that require collateral). But the wider market remained open. Anyone could buy or sell shares at all times. They just needed to put up the collateral themselves for the 2 day settlement period, or find someone who would do so on their behalf.

If you're already sitting down then stand up, now sit back down. 

First off, *fuck your bitch and the clique you claim*, when I watch a movie I want to see it on a massive 70+ FOOT screen. You think I want to watch a gem like Frozen 2 on small bitch ass 60 inch TV screen with shitty ass TV speakers? No. I WANT THAT FUCKING BASS REVERBERATING THROUGH MY TESTIES AND IT TICKLE MY ANUS. Thats some good shit. I ain't getting this shit at home. My wife doesn't like losers who watch movies on small ass TV screens. That's why she's with her boyfriend right now. 

Secondly, I don't have a fucking fountain soda machine in my house. Im a poor retard who is trying to make a living like Steve Cohen. Nothing is better then sippin' that sweet carbonated nectar with a big fat bin of popcorn or a god damn pretzel. I also don't have an arcade section to kill time. SOME EVEN HAVE BARS. 

Thirdly, this shit is 13$ right now. Severely under valued.    Its not the company's fault that shit stains suppressed this stock for years and prevented further growth. Its not the company's fault that covid fucked its business right in the ass. 

But guess what, we have vaccines now! Covid is far from over but its only a matter of time until our wives respect us by watching üöÄ Man on big ass fucking screens like we ü¶ç are supposed to. 

They are embracing streaming like the chads they are:

Chicago is opening up more theaters and as restrictions are lessened more will open up:

They cut into their debt which means NO BANKRUPTCY!

This is a 40$ stock, at the very least and when they're clicking on all cylinders it can go even FURTHER BEYOND. It will take time to get there but this is a no brainer hold!

Position: 1k shares, avg $8.7. 

TLDR: I like this stock. I like watching movies in the theater.

We are entering a new stage of the short squeeze.  It‚Äôs apparent by now that it‚Äôs not playing out like the VW short squeeze because the setup was so long and out in the open.  Hedge funds had time to collude and plan how they‚Äôre going to deal with the fallout.  As we saw last week, they came up with some clever fuckery.

&#x200B;

For a recap, here are some tactics we saw from them:

\-  Short attacks driving the price down, triggering stop loss sells and trading halts.

\-  Spreading the word through the media that they had already closed their short positions

\-  Putting pressure on brokers to limit buying of GME and killing the buy side of the trade, making it easier to drive the price down.

\-  Low volume ladder attacks to drive the price down and forcing out paper hands.

&#x200B;

We held strong, guys and gals.  We closed Friday just a few dollars shy of the highest closing price on Wednesday.  But now the real trench warfare begins.

Melvin told CNBC that they closed out their short positions.  I have a theory that this may not be technically false, with a caveat.  I think it‚Äôs very possible that Hedgies have closed out their ORIGINAL short positions, but they‚Äôve been replaced with new short positions.  These guys are not going to lose billions of dollars lying down, so they must have their own end game for how to get out of the trade alive, and perhaps even make a profit.  

If GME was a tasty short target at $15, imagine how irresistible it is at $320.  These fuckers lost their shirts on the original trade, but they see an opportunity to make it back on this new trade by repositioning their old shorts from the $15 to new shorts in the $200-300s.

&#x200B;

How can we know this is likely true?:

\-  The short interest has fluctuated, so we know there has been some covering

\-  The short interest has remained high, somewhere around 100% or above

\-  There have been short attacks in $100s, $200s, and $300s, so we know there are new short positions at those levels.

\-  Hedge funds are cocky assholes and they‚Äôll do anything to turn a losing trade into a winning one, and if it fucks over the little guy to scare them back to submission, all the better.

&#x200B;

So basically, nothing has changed.  This is still a short squeeze play, just with much higher stakes.  We have the advantage however, because it doesn‚Äôt cost us anything to hold onto our shares, whereas it‚Äôs costing Hedgies billions of dollars to hold out.  We will know we are winning next week if we continue to see more de-grossing in the broader market.  If we can hold out, we can take this to the next leg up, ACT III, and eventually the end game.

Retail investors, (not wsb, there is no we here) are Frontpoint, they are Scion Capital, they are Brownfield. They aim to benefit from the collapse. 





**Lives will be destroyed, and it's not just the rich that will suffer**




If this squeeze happens, and you find yourself on the profit side of the trade, prepare yourself for actual war. They will attack you, they will attack everything they can. They can freeze accounts, they can shut down this subreddit, they can send people to jail. And you best believe they will.

Don't think you'll have much to worry cause you'll just ride off into the sunset with all of your tendies? Lawyers cost a lot of money. Bank accounts can be frozen. Your money might not even make it to you if your broker goes under. 





**(TLDR) What I am saying is, Make appropriate choices and please be mindful on how you post online. The rest of your life might just depend on it.**

I keep asking myself...


Why the fuck was $BB limited too, they fucking got caught shorting [before this news](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) which is huge, that's full partnership all the way to market in a car manufacturer huge.

They lost and used $GMEs momentum to halt it and hide, then short ladder attacked it all week (in the literal matching pattern of GME and AMC)

You know how fucking hard that is to stop when they limited a $15(was $27) to 5 shares?

&nbsp;

*By slowing $BB I theorize they may have showed more of their cards than you think*.... *hear me out.*


***Theory:***  They run algos as a hedge ""group"" however many invested in and benefit from the trade data of retail (let's call them dipshits) 

Dipshits found an algo that has been printing free money for years, simple. Every play you see retail doing, wait until I hits certain metrics and short the fuck out of it to collect paychecks. 


Problem being: these moved faster than dipshits algo could ge recognize so it saw more sentiment and went for more shorts.

*and they don't have an off button*

So combine that with the bots spamming social media (that their algos monitor for plays) and dipshits were getting metrics readouts that said free money here. 

So they asked for $2.75 billion more to put on it. 

Dipshits iterally only have one play, to wait until a group gets excited and then short the stock for your money - ***and it's not fucking working*** so they stopped the game to try to turn it off (notice they still bought more short positions this week)

The $BB short position was only 7% shorts, so by their volatility definition it doesn't apply(so again why stop trade).... but it's now 9% shorted *after that news?!?*

***TLDR:***

But REMEMBER to have the most fun with your money by giving it away and back to the communities that got you to where you could be today. (Small amounts count and mean the world to others when they think their world is crashing).

Everything had to line up in the world sequentially for all of this to happen for you.

I am a firm believer that the more you can make an impact with your money - the more happier and fun your life will become. You don't have to give away thousands or millions regularly. Go to Walmart and pay off a layaway. Pay for the food for the person behind you. Be a good person. Make the difference.

Understand that as fast as you aquired this money, is as fast as it can disappear if you don't put some away. (hence the billionaires panicking).

Also, don't forget to support the businesses you cashed in on. This is pretty much a once in a lifetime to save your country post-pandemic from decline of past lifestyle hobbies.

To the abroad investors, thank you for having the back of the world - in order to hopefully reform the free market and free world for what it should be.

This should show you that the world is not as bad as politics or the news may try to make it out to be. We are hand in hand when it counts.

Dont get propagandized this is the real reason why they are terrified of us.

Hedge funds don't get unlimited money they dont got papa jpow's printer (yet). How do they raise money? By showing good returns and getting investors. So the hedge fund goes out there and tells all the millionaires that hey we can give you 10% returns on these regardless of market conditions and we are the only ones who can do it since we are oh so smart. Then we come along and we flip the script. By now, every single millionaire around the world has heard about GME and what we have done. Melvin was the poster child of hedge fund, their messiah of just how ""smart"" they are and they paraded them to show why hedge funds are the only way to make money. And we are taking them down without barely lifting a finger.

This is what scares them. The rest of the hedge funds dont give a shit about Melvin capital losing billions, less competition for them! But by now they have gotten calls from every one of their investor and realized these guys are just as stupid as my 10 year old why do I need them in the first place? Is all the research and analyst calls and all just for me to buy into this scheme? If enough people pull their investments from them and put it into indices THEY ARE FUCKED. Hedge funds only have power because of their collective bargaining of their investors. Once you chip away that power they are just glorified wsb users. Hedge funds fight other hedge funds every single fucking day and it barely registers on the news anymore but this is a direct attack on their way of doing business and that's why you are seeing  monumental amount of hedge fund apologists coming out to attack us.

TLDR: I am neither your dad (maybe) nor you financial advisor. Hedge funds are scared because we are attacking their bottom line. All I want to see is Melvin capital go bankrupt and this scam exposed for the world to see.

[Charts in question](https://ibb.co/album/TrQtGN).

Thousands of $GME enthusiasts from all around the globe bought shares of the company they like. I always thought this was the core principal of a free market - you like some company (for any reason you can name), you buy it's shares, this company gets additional capital to finance it's development/operations/research/etc which results in the consumer receiving better goods/services provided by given company, this company appreciates in value, you as an investor profit off of it, everyone's happy.

But there's always someone on the other side of every bet, remember? It seems like that **someone** is quite unhappy with the **commons** taking away their tendies and beating them fair and square at their own game. Probably you have seen media *talking heads advocating for ultra wealthy and blaming it all on the retail trader* (which is absurd by any definition, but they simply don't care - they're doing their job which they are payed for).

You've also probably heard their thesis that everything's about to go under and blah blah blah if commons don't surrender. Which is interesting by itself, so will *everything and everyone* indeed go under or just some *financial institutions that are on the losing side of the bet*? Probably the latter.

So here's the question (which is not a financial advice by any means, I'm just exercising my right for freedom of speech and voicing my opinion here): *what will happen to the share prices of those financial institutions that took the losing side of the bet and are bleeding money in billions already*? How will their next quarterlies look like? What if **commons took their capital away from these institutions by shorting enemy stock and channeled it to the company they liked and believed in**?

**TL;DR**: *the opponent on the other side of the $GME bet is losing and is heavily exposed to the market at the moment, is in great need of capital influx to cover his losing positions, which itself opens up an opportunity to short him and make money on a side bet.*

First of all, congrats it you got in early and are still holding!  I did some quick technicals on GME to figure out where we ""might"" be going and if you though the top was in, I would urge you to have a quick look at [This Chart](https://imgur.com/a/htc2sYJ)

As you can see, GME is in consolidation a very well defined Bull Flag which by these technicals should be breaking out of sometime this next week.  If we apply Eliot Curve thesis to this, we are currently in the B wave of the A-B-C pattern.  The way these typically play out is by applying the A wave to the end of the B wave, which should give us an idea of how big the next move will be (the C wave).  By these technicals, I'm showing the next move up should put GME around $650-$700.

**Disclaimer:**  Sadly I hold no position in GME, I was too late and now lack the capital to be a part of this, but wanted to share this with everyone to both get constructive feedback, but also to help calm any nerves should any Toilet Paper handed bitches who might be thinking about selling next week.

On 1/27/2021 there was a 4X increase in 3 month avg volume across all CTs. 

Some news may be coming up or someone knows something.

# [Goldman Sach is still considering these bankrupt shorted Lehman shares as collateral and is not returning the funds of shorters who did not cover the shorted Lehman Shares.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-14/in-this-never-ending-lehman-short-170-000-is-still-on-the-table) 

# From the above article, $170000 of shorter funds is still blocked for 68013 shares, giving the bankrupt shorted Lehman shares a value of almost $2.5/share.

Lehman may reemerge from Bankruptcy this year with 50 billion dollars in net operating losses (NOLS) that can be purchased by big boys to set off their potential profits. 

Also Lehman CTs pay a 6% dividend (on a face value of $25/share equivalent to at least $1.5 share/dividend) as per prospectus agreements which has been suspended due to bankruptcy proceedings

The clue that Lehman may reemerge from the ashes are:

¬∑ The preservation of the NOL of $50 billion

¬∑ The 24.1B cash back 

¬∑ And the most recent clue is when they announce the dividend and ongoing business in UK.

Lehman Brothers may soon rise from its ashes in 2021. 

In 2008 it was estimated to recover only 36 Billion, and as of date it has [recovered more than $100 billion to its creditors.](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2019/01/creditor-recovery-in-lehmans-bankruptcy.html)

It holds net operating losses NOL of $ 50 billion and potential NOLS of $150 billion that make it a prime acquisition target when it reemerges.

# The best part of these NOLS is that according to IRS rules, existing Lehman shareholders must be majority owners of the company when they reemerge for them to continue to retain the tax benefits of the NOLS.

The potential $150 billion in NOLS can be written against their potential profits off by companies that acquire these NOLS upto 2028 . Only the big boys will be interested in such a large amount of NOLs and these NOLS could be worth billions of dollars.

This could finally be our jackpot after waiting for 12 years. Most of Lehman shares are in one big share OBS (escrow) and dont trade. Only the [four CTs trade](https://yhoo.it/2NAQhCI.).

""your brokerage firm cannot lend out your stocks without your permission. However, you may have signed a customer agreement that explicitly allows your broker to lend out your securities.

I've used the example of when NFLX shipped DVDs in the mail [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4cvmt/why_im_long_gme/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to illustrate my view that people who have majored in Finance/Accounting are going to value a company by what it's traditionally done, and not by what it *could* do.

But as I watch the hundreds and hundreds of posts about $GME now I worry that **Reddit Retail** is now falling into the trap of lacking imagination.

So, think of the Spongebob ""Imagination!"" meme for a second and then follow along with me: if I were at a Short Hedge Fund that was still Short $GME I would flatten my position next week by completely bypassing the Stock Market.

The Institutional and Fund Holding rates of $GME is over 70%, which means that only around 20% of the float is free to trade when you discount Insiders. So since Short Hedge Funds need shares to unwind, the two places they can go are the stock market and Dark Pools.

Now if you don't know what Dark Pools are, you might want to pause and rethink sinking your entire life savings into meme stocks. Dark Pools are private exchanges set up for Funds to move massive amounts of stock invisibly and without causing volatility. A Fund Long $GME simply offers up a block of stock and Short Funds can bid on it. I suppose you can think of it as a private auction house for Billionaires.

Interestingly, because of all the attention **Reddit Retail** currently has, it's actually possible that Funds currently Long $GME will NOT be willing to bail out the Shorts via Dark Pools, because one anonymous whistleblower could cause a massive PR headache for the Long Fund. Funds that shorted $GME are currently being vilified (I personally see Shorts as being an important part of the financial ecosystem) and I'm not sure any Longs would want to be known as having bailed them out.

What is that? 
Well thats when you make a trade, it takes 2 days after that for the funds to settle. Some brokers have a T+1 rule

Because of this, Robin the hood had to limit the amount of shares being sold because of increased Margin requirements up to 100%. 

Now if I havent lost you I have easily already lost my original thought but heres my point.

WHY DO FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS TAKE SO LONG? 

If we buy the stock with the money in our account thats legit there and ours, why isnt the full transaction from both ends cleared up in 1 day or hours? 

Its starting to look like that (other trading thing I cant name cause its banned) could start to have some real life uses....

* Nervous paperhands; **GME IS A GLOBAL PHENOMENON**. Relax, look at the price action so far; there will be fluctuations with the hedgies trading shares between each other, but holy fuck **the price will always recover**. The next time a short folds, I'm expected a full-blown domino effect of panicked shorts exiting their positions. You **do not want to miss it**.
* Shorts have **lied about exiting positions**. Repeatedly. Public declarations of closing a short position? Price action to back it up? **Nope.**
* They may have lightened *some* of the more extreme shorts (GME AT 1 DOLLA etc), but their arrogance left them exposed. Why close at such a massive loss when they're *so smart* afterall, surely a bit of public manipulation, block trading on a few platforms, and the price will crash hard? **Denied** üíéüôå
* When trading platforms stopped/limited purchases of GME? Couldn't they have exited then? Sure! They could have exited some positions at optimal timing. But lets look at the short %; They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up (credit to the Bot Spam ;P)
* Volume of Puts that expired on Friday is astronomical, more in the coming weeks. What does this mean? More pain for those bearish hedge lads.
* Fintel is saying a big fat on Shares Available to Short ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)), this is as of 28th.
* Given the lack of MASSIVE bursts on Friday, and somewhat sideways trading, we can assume minimal shorts exited then. They wanted to control the price, and finish below 320 (huge Call volume there). They failed. And why? Because GME is a global phenomenon, retail investors, and sympathetic whales moving in for the kill.

And finally, look at that glorious **STRONG BUY** rating üíéüôå Hold those shares fellow retards; for those of you not yet in the game, it's never too late. I've seen some nervy posts, be wary of disinformation tactics and paper hands (check user profiles and account age).

Up to this point, I think it should be clear that HF are closing their longs in order to cover the shorts.

This means a decrease in stock price for other institutions aswell. Those institutions need to hedge that risk, but are restricted from buying puts. The only way for them to hedge is by buying stocks with a high short ratio, especially GME. Some of you might have noticed that GME is running the whole highly shorted market by now. Well thats your reason. 

Therefore the argument that retail will run out of money or Robinhood will stop the GME run is not true. **What we are witnessing right now is the downfall of the Long/Short Portfolio**. Those shills at CNBC just don¬¥t understand *why* GME is going up. It¬¥s not a bubble and it¬¥s not a mania. 

I saw some posts about buying puts on SPY. First of all, that's pretty gay. Second, those smooth-brains don¬¥t understand that **GME is the hedge against a possible downturn**.

Dear WallStreet and CNBC,

You have been calling this a speculative bubble, that GameStop will ultimately crash down to earth, and that the ‚Äúlittle guys‚Äù are going to get hurt. Jim Cramer wants us to ‚Äútake your home run‚Äù and sell. You use words like ‚Äúfundamentals‚Äù and ‚Äúvaluations‚Äù and says that the stock price is not justified. 

Here‚Äôs the fundamental:
I am an ER doctor that trained in inner city Detroit. When I was a resident physician, Obama was president. During his presidency, the quality of life of the predominantly African-Americans in the city did not improve. Despite Obamacare, I saw little improvement in the health outcomes of the patients I worked with. I saw continued proliferation of illicit drugs, overdoses, and gang violence. YOU have left these people behind.

I spent the last several years working in a small town in the Midwest, when Trump was president. During his presidency, the quality of life of the predominantly white Americans also did not improve, and have in fact worsened. I saw continued proliferation of illicit drugs, overdoses, and suicides. These patients I care for are also people whom YOU have left behind. 

With the pandemic, I have seen those who are already at the brink of financial solvency lose their jobs and I see lines outside food banks. I see the health outcomes of my patients decline as they forego preventive care. I, on the other hand, kept my job, got a raise, and saw the value of my 401k rise as the economy crashed around me. Going to work every day is a constant and stark reminder of the brokenness and disparity of the economic system and my sheer powerlessness to change it. I realize now that it is not political. It is YOU.

I own GameStop because represents something to me. It is the very embodiment of the millennial generation that you have left behind- a down-and-out aging retailer that you feel is no longer worth investing in. We ARE GameStop. We are not selling because we believe in ourselves and investing in ourselves. We WANT to see it succeed.

I am fully aware that I have benefited from having a 401k and it is what is supporting your industry. But this also means that YOU work for ME. I fully expect you to fuck over my generation to save yourselves by running to the politicians and regulators that you have bought to stop the squeeze and get them to suspend trading on $GME. It is not lost on us that the former Fed chair Ben Bernanke is a senior advisor at Citadel and that you paid Janet Yellen $800,000 in speaking fees. You will tell them that this is a ‚Äúsystemic risk‚Äù and that this will ‚Äúcrash the entire financial system‚Äù. You will remind them what happened after they let Lehman Brothers fail in 2008. Don‚Äôt.

If you are a politician or a regulator reading this, don‚Äôt listen to their bullshit. If you intervene, stop trading of $GME, bail out hedge funds and big banks like you have in the past and try to placate us by dragging a few hedge fund managers in front of a congressional hearing, you‚Äôll unite the entire country against YOU. Make sure you are on the right side of this. You work for US too.
 
This country is broken and fractured. You have goaded us into tearing each other apart for years. This is the first time that I have seen the entire country rally behind a single cause. You have given us a reason to unite- against you and the system you have built and upheld. 

I own GameStop not because Diamond Hands. I own GameStop because I AM GameStop. I am choosing to invest in my generation, and selling would be selling myself out."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185631.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['CNBC', 'I', 'ER', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'YOU', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'YOU', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'YOU', 'I', 'ARE', 'WANT', 'I', 'I', 'YOU', 'ME', 'I', '$GME', '$GME', 'YOU', 'US', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'AM', 'I']|['GME', 'GME']

WE ARE CHANGING THE WORLD üåé 


From the last few paragraphs of her January 29th report https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/january-29-2021



‚ÄúThe Democrats‚Äô hand has likely been strengthened this week by the media frenzy over the so-called ‚ÄúGameStop short squeeze,‚Äù in which hedge fund managers got squeezed by ordinary investors driving up the price of the stock of a video game retailer so that the hedge funds could not cover short sales. Investment firms promptly cried foul, only to be greeted with derision, since it is not at all clear that their own stock purchases have a better effect on the markets than those of the smaller investors, and since they made huge money betting on the Covid-19 crisis. Observers see the short squeeze as a populist attack on unscrupulous Wall Street types.

While the entire story behind the short squeeze is not yet clear, it does already have a political meaning. The GameStop story reinforced the growing sense that the system has been rigged for the wealthy. People from across the political spectrum are demanding more thorough regulation of the stock market, a dramatic cultural change.‚Äù"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185643.csv|StockTicker|['GME', 'COVID']|['GME']|['GME', 'WE', 'ARE', 'NGING', 'THE', 'WORLD']|['GME']

Who would've thought that my joke YOLO of $5k would turn into $200k and I'd be worried about my money?


And before anyone calls me a shill: fuck those guys. If they're not colluding with hedge funds, they look shady as shit. Restricting stock, changing their policies to force sales of options BEFORE the 3:00pm EST cutoff time, and selling at the absolute worst time possible? Yeah they're gonna face some serious repercussions. The SEC, FINRA, NYSE, DOJ, FBI, Congress...they're all gonna look into what these guys did. If they find a shred of evidence of wrongdoing against old Vlad there, the dude is going to federal prison. Mark my words: he will absolutely be the fall guy. And forget about their IPO. That company is done. Fuck 'em.


I've already filed complaints with the SEC, FINRA, and NYSE, and I encourage everyone to do the same. Restricting stock trading was probably their biggest mistake, and I hope they go down for it.


Ok now that that's out of the way, here's what I think is going on over there:


Half of all Robinhood users own GME stock. That's a fucking absurd number. And we're buying the shit out of it at volumes no one has ever seen before. On top of that, we managed to get Robinhood's app to #1 in the App store. Not for investing or finance, but for EVERYTHING. That's an internet hug of death that would've overwhelmed anyone.


And everyone who downloaded it bought GME.


On top of that, despite our motto of buy and **HOLD**, there are some guys who are swing trading this shit every time it spikes and tanks. Stupid and I hope we leave them in the dust, but it's happening.


So let's say, on an average day, Robinhood does 10 million trades (no idea, making it up). On Wednesday, they did 100 million trades (example) and freaked the fuck out. When we buy/sell a stock, it looks like it's instant, but some stuff goes on behind the scenes that we'll never see. Basically, at the end of the day, all of the brokers come to the bar and settle up their tabs. And they can't use our money to do it for...reasons. So they have to have the $ available to pay their bills. These are the clearing houses you may have heard about.


And we just absolutely overwhelmed them. They were prepared for maybe up to 100 million trades overall, but not 100 million on a single stock. And not when we're also buying the shit out of AMC, BB, BBBY, and others. So what did they do? They panicked.


They restricted buying of those stocks in order to be able to pay their tabs on Thursday and Friday. They also went out and raised $1 billion from investors (good move). But what they DIDN'T do was explain wtf was going on to investors. They simply said this was for our protection and due to volatility.


This is...actually true. Sort of. They have to pay their tab. If they can't do it, we can't buy/sell at all and they could go under. And this is all because of what we're doing, which is creating massive volatility. They actually ran into a similar problem back in March last year when they raised $200 million because, again, we bought the shit out of stuff.


The CEO should have come out and said, ""Look, we're having liquidity issues that have nothing to do with bankruptcy. We're very profitable (they are), you're just buying too much, too fast, and we weren't prepared for it. So it was either this or we go under. We chose this.""


Except what would your average Redditor hear?


**OMG THEY'RE BANKRUPT!!** That would cause mass panic. We'd actually probably fuck this whole thing up. Everyone would sell their GME shares and try to rush out of Robinhood, the GME stock would tank, short sellers would win, and we'd lose the game.


And this wasn't just Robinhood. E-Trade, Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, and Webull all had the same issues. Webull wasn't as shitty about it and the CEO came out and explained, and then allowed trading again.


Over the weekend, Robinhood should come out and tell the people what's going on in a VERY calm way. Then go to Chase and secure a $10 billion line of credit for the short squeeze and tell us you're doing it. Stop restricting trading. Apologize profusely and send us all $40 DoorDash gift cards.


If you have $ with Robinhood and it's not tied up in GME, do as others have suggested and switch to Fidelity, Vanguard, Chase, etc. If you're stuck, you're stuck. If the absolute worst case scenario happens and Robinhood somehow ends up bankrupt, we have SIPC protection (like FDIC) up to $500,000. And the federal government will step in and liquidate them and try to get you your $ back as well. In almost every single instance of a broker failing, people were able to get almost all of their money back. So don't worry about that TOO much.


In the end, yes, Robinhood deserves a shit ton of blame for all of this and I hope they go bankrupt when they IPO. I think it's extremely suspicious that they have a relationship with the guys we're up against, and their actions don't look good at all. I hope we just overwhelmed them, and the coming week will probably give us more insight into whether they're innocent or guilty.


So again: fuck Robinhood for what they did. They can try to turn things around and be more transparent so we can at least trade this week. It benefits all of us to hope they succeed, because that's where most of the GME buying is happening.


**EDIT**: So why not transfer my money or shares elsewhere? Because it takes too long and we have no idea when this thing is gonna go nuclear. If I felt like I had time, believe me, these shares would be on their way to Fidelity right now. But if we hit $1,000 or $10,000/share in the next few days and my shares are locked, I won't be able to sell. They'd probably clear right around the time this thing came back down to earth. I'd want to die."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185649.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'YOLO', 'EFORE', 'EST', 'SEC', 'FINRA', 'NYSE', 'DOJ', 'FBI', 'IPO', 'SEC', 'FINRA', 'NYSE', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'THING', 'GME', 'I', 'AMC', 'BB', 'BBBY', 'T', 'CEO', 'OMG', 'RE', 'KRUPT', 'GME', 'GME', 'TD', 'CEO', 'VERY', 'GME', 'SIPC', 'TOO', 'I', 'IPO', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'BBBY', 'OMG', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Get one thing straight idiots...GME is truly a unicorn right now. It was bet to basically go into the ground. I hope it keeps rising but let‚Äôs be real, the restriction on share count and removal of fractional shares on RH could slow this down. 

But.

These other tickers that are being harpooned into space are not without cause. Why are they being harpooned?

Because we LIKE these companies.

Because these companies have been beaten down during COVID or the current tech onslaught.

And...because they are not OVERVALUED.

Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix, etc. are at or near ALL TIME HIGHS. Their ongoing innovation is by buying up companies like GME to put under their umbrella.

We're ""advised"" not to buy at the peak but when we switch to tickers that are on the bottom floor...we're told not to do that too?

Fuck that. And Fuck Wall Street.

Robinhood's baby gloves ticker list are the next wave because they're all severely undervalued. Wall St wants to continue to inflate big tech to screw us when they ride the wave back down.

I believe that is partly due to misinformation about the ease of switching so please read if this applies to you.**

Let me start by saying the following: People can sell when they want, buy when they want, and I have no agenda here regarding that.  I also don't work for any other platform and I really don't care which one you move to, if you move at all.  I have read dozens of posts from Robinhood users (I am not a user of their platform) that range from mild displeasure to full-on outrage.  I have read far fewer posts, however, about people actually initiating the process of moving to a better online brokerage option.  There are several but first let's cover some basics so that you are fully informed on how easy it is.  If you had started the process of moving on Thursday when you should have you'd probably be ready by Tuesday/Wednesday of this week so don't delay any further!

**I Read Three Main Concerns, Each I will Briefly Address:**

1. Users think they have to sell their holdings first.  THAT IS FALSE.
2. Users think they can only use one platform.  THAT IS FALSE.
3. Users think the process is difficult or other brokerages cost money.  THAT IS FALSE.

**You Do NOT Have To Sell Anything:** Online brokerages gain and lose clients all the time and anything a transfer occurs it is VERY simple.  I'm finding this aspect of the posts so confusing because it's just as easy to open a new account online at any of the ""Big Boy"" brokerages as it is with Robinhood.  You simply go online, answer questions, and generally your account is open right away!  Next you'll need to fund the new account which you can do in several ways or a combo of a few.  You can link the new account to a checking/savings account you have with a bank, you can transfer assets (UNSOLD) from an old account your new one, and usually one or two other options.  The term for transferring holdings from one brokerage to another is **""In Kind Transfer""**.  Essentially, if you own shares in many stocks or shares in just one stock the old brokerage simply transfers them to the new one.

It would be good to have the routing and account number handy from any account you wish to bring money from too.  If you don't know this simply call your bank first thing Monday morning and ask.  Or go to a branch.  Or go look at the bottom of a check you have and find them there (Google which number is which so you get it right).

**You Can Have Multiple Accounts With Different Brokerages:**  An easier option may simply be to open a new account over the weekend with a different brokerage, get the funds transfer started ASAP, and as soon as the money is there then you can start buying whatever you want from your new account.  You can own *X number* of shares of a company in Robinhood and *Y number* of shares in that same company with a different brokerage.  This is generally what I find my peers to be doing (I'm considered of boomer age by the WSB population) and there are actually a number of reasons to do this.  I think in light of events from this week that point should be self-evident.

**This Process Could Not Be Easier, And Ironically Robinhood (& Others) Applied Pressure Years Ago And Now Most Accounts Have Free Trading:**  That's right, my boomer Vanguard account used to charge a commission for me to buy/sell stock.  Now it is free!  Similarly the commission on options has come down.  Robinhood tricked you into thinking they were doing something different or better.  They actually weren't and certainly now they aren't.

CAVEAT: Vanguard's app sucks.  Some of the other grown-up brokerages apps are better and I've never used Robinhood (but I've seen a million screen shots) and it seems that Robinhood and similar brokerages did design easier platforms, especially mobile-based platforms.  ***HOWEVER, when you've got thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of dollars at stake I'm dumbfounded why a user wouldn't want something LESS basic.***

The transfer may cost you $75 at most (from what I'm reading) but I think the move would be worth it.  But as I wrote above, if you don't want to transfer then just open a new account and keep two open.  One that treats you like shit and tells what you're allowed to do with your money and a new one that appreciates your business and allows you to do whatever you want.  Not sure the choice should be hard here.

**FINALLY, A Note About Margin:** All accounts can have Margin (generally) but that doesn't mean you should use it.  I thought all night about writing this because if you fucks come onto one of my platforms and do a ton of stupid shit and get me banned from being able to buy/sell common stocks I'll be pissed.  But in the effort of giving us, the little guy a chance I felt it better to put this here.  ***Borrowing money to buy stocks is stupid and in the long run you will lose money either from depreciation of account value or interest OR BOTH.***  If you're holding GME on margin right now, for example, you might be best opening a new account and not doing a transfer because you don't want your new brokerage to restrict your trading because you seem high risk.  Obviously some of the bigger, better brokerages may start making their new account process harder anyway if they see an influx of what they deem to be risky investors coming over but I'd suggest you be first in line before that happens if you want to be up and trading THIS WEEK.

I have buried this part at the bottom because I wanted the message to be heard before any of my own thoughts were placed in here.  \*\*I personally am finding it a bit on the nose that so many people are claiming that they're going to ""\*\****hold until Valhalla!""*** **and yet they aren't willing to freeze their trading ability for a 4-5 business day process for a transfer to happen.**  That is suspect AF to me but that's just me.

If people want recommendations of brokerages to consider new accounts with I offer some ideas:

* Vanguard
* TRowe Price
* Merrill Edge (especially if you bank with Bank of America this is going to be your best bet because money should transfer instantly)
* Fidelity
* TDAmeritrade/Charles Schwab (though I may have read they're restricting buying so check that first)

To my knowledge all of these platforms allow you to sign up for a new account instantly online, or very close to it.  If you do nothing over the weekend and nothing first thing Monday morning to correct this Robinhood situation that it seems many of you are in (and believe me, I feel we're brothers in this and therefore I'm trying to help) then I will remain baffled and I'll be sad to see you guys continue to be squeezed.  I have been able to buy dips this past week that you guys weren't and that sucks.  Good luck gents, you no longer have any reason to be dicked around by Robinhood and I suggest you get on this ASAP because this week could get worse.

It is already clear from this week that hedge funds will not go down without a fight, and why should we have expected any less. There is FUD, market manipulation, smear campaigns against us, and paid bots and shilling diversions, just more ways to get your small peasant brain to chase after the next shiny object like the plebian shit-class untouchable you are to them. So what is there to consider?

**The Fundamentals remain unchanged**

Short float is still sitting at 120% and new shorts waiting to profit off of the end drop of the squeeze are coming on board every day. THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF NEW SHORTS. This is great news in one way. The short squeeze still has the potential to blow up. You still have the potential to make fat TENDIES.

1. **DFV is still inüíé üôå**
2. **Both sides are still inüíé üôå**
3. **IM STILL MOTHERFUCKING IN**.**üíé üôå**

**Hedge funds are just as retarded as us**

Are you seriously going to believe that the people running the markets are not just as fucking stupid and arrogant. They have been winning for decades. They think we are marks and have no problem doubling their position in spite of us. They will make fatal flaws that will eventually pay off in the form of a short squeeze once they cant bear the interest.

SO HOW CAN WE GET SCREWED?

There are a number of unprecedented ways this whole scenario can go fucking sideways that you should always be aware of.

1. **We are no longer Us vs Citadel - THE SEC HALTS TRADING ON GME FOR A WEEK OR MONTH**

The world is watching, politicians are watching, other hedge funds, and retards all over the globe. Most important the SEC and the US government is watching. This has almost become a social movement, and the MOMENT it shifts from a good deal and fundamentals in the market to a social movement to fuck over the market and hedge funds the SEC will step in to protect the market.

This is because of our own weight, people joining on because they see the hype against hedge funds and not understanding the market principles behind why a short squeeze will happen.

THERE IS ALREADY PEOPLE CALLING FOR A WEEK OR MONTH LONG HALT TO PROTECT THE MARKET FROM A SOCIAL MOVEMENT. THE SEC DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU.

YELLEN TOOK NEARLY A MILLION IN SPEAKING FEES FROM CITADEL. SHE IS NOT ON YOUR SIDE. She cant overtly help citadel because that would be collusion but she has enough dick swing to make a freeze on both sides that would cool the momentum off on our side, and give the other side enough time to increase their covers.

2. **The players have changed**

Nobody has to disclose what short percentage they are holding. There are so many new shorts that we don't know if it is still Melvin, Citadel, or a completely new set of players at a much higher short position. I highly doubt the original players are still holding their worst short positions and if they have dropped those and put themselves in a much higher short level, the price in which we need to bring GME will increase drastically in order for them to feel the pressure.

Citadel is a FUCKING PRO, they are very fucking likely on both sides of this trade. If you don't believe they are already holding long positions, dumping their most dangerous short positions, and intending to make money UP the squeeze and DOWN the squeeze you are deluded to how hedge funds work. The smartest players play both sides.

3. **The government steps in and bails out the shorts**

This is not going to be a 2008 scenario where you all get a fat payday from daddy USA riding in a white fucking unicorn. There are people all over the world long GME and the gov would never just hand you a payout at whatever price you want. It will look like back door incentives to reduce their position. It will be behind closed doors and the percentage of the profit you will see from this will be low as fuck.

4. **Gamestop itself is forced to dilute its shares**

This is the absolutely worst-case scenario, with one fell swoop the short % would shrink below 100, the risk of a squeeze would deflate, the price would get diluted, and cause a run on GME and its collapse. This would save hedge funds and wipe everyone long GME out.

They cant do this? Don't fucking delude yourself, the government can and will strong-arm Gamestop to do whatever the fuck it feels is best to diffuse the situation if it feels like this will have an impact on the overall market.

&#x200B;

Get your fucking shit together and play the same game they are playing.

**Want to stop the SEC from fucking you?** Write letters to the SEC, Write letters to your congressmen, the governer, Joe fucking biden himself.

**Want to stick it to Melvin capital and hedge funds?** Go protest outside Zuccotti park and have the same nothing effect as the OCCUPY movement had. This GME play is SOLELY because WE LIKE THE STOCK AND THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE GOOD. WE ARE NOT A SOCIAL MOVEMENT and if thats why you are here you are fucking stupider than Melvin himself.

**Want to mentally prepare yourself for the worst? - If you're a little bitchmade paper handed pussy who will cry when you get margin called or bankrupted then reduce your fucking position asap. The people YOLOing millies here are either LOSS VETERANS or doing their DD. ACCEPT YOU MAY LOSE IT ALL AND REMEMBER THIS IS FUCKING AMERICA WE ARE TALKING ABOUT.**

Ps. I am not a financial advisor or american, but Gamestop is and this whole thing can go sideways in ways you may have not thought of.

It took 10 minutes and a couple hours to transfer money. 

Strap in you üíé üñê studs, we‚Äôre about to leave the solar system üöÄüöÄüöÄ

This was always a good play. The logic and reasoning was there. A large number of shorts were in play and so long as people hold, there is money to be made. 

This requires 2 things. 
* That the retail investor buys and holds
* That the market doesn‚Äôt cheat

The first one is tough. If people start üßª üñê‚Äòing this bitch, it‚Äôs not going to work and Wall Street wins. You have to rely on a bunch of random strangers to make the same play as you, and that implies inherent risk. 

But you mother fucking autists did it! You held through everything they‚Äôve thrown at us! I‚Äôve never been more proud to be a retard. 

So one out of the two we‚Äôre set for, if Reddit held through that dip, they will hold through everything. If DFV can hold, I can hold. 

Which leads to the second point. Wall Street cheating. The thought is(was) that as long as this is fair, we 100% make money as long as point one holds true. The bad news is that it isn‚Äôt fair and the market always cheats, so again risky. 

Except we knew those corporate shills were going to cheat, did cheat and you fucking autists still held! You‚Äôve proved your valor time and time again. 

Which is the wrap up. Wall Street cheated and still is losing! We know for a fact point one holds true, and because of Wall Streets cheating it will be even harder now that every eye is on them. 

This literally can‚Äôt go tits up positions all in $GME üöÄ üåô 


Bonus point*

#(The argument for why no one gets left behind.)

The first thing to say is that even after a squeeze happens keep holding. 

The reason for this is as follows. 

Firstly, Thursday the shorts position went from 140% to 250% (this is debated. Numbers came from a dd post Thursday. Though I do remember seeing total shorts go up). This means they think they can win and doubled down. So there is a lot more at play. 

But here‚Äôs why the HF will always lose if we hold. Think about the stock, it‚Äôs doing really well, but is it going to hold long term? Eventually it has to fall, right?

That‚Äôs exactly what hedge funds are thinking. They think it‚Äôs overvalued and therefore will drop. So their play is to take out more shorts. 

Except this time, the community knows this, so we just keep holding. Eventually the hedge funds can‚Äôt keep taking out shorts cause they know we will keep holding and the stock will stay stagnant with Wall Street never being able to win. Sure the price may fall gradually from 10k+, but wall street will never be able to make money cause as soon as they short, we hold. 


Hope the logic is easy to follow, I‚Äôm not a financial advisor, just someone who got high last night

I sold part of my position as I want to buy a house and that money definitely helps (at the end of the day we want money for these kind of things). I am still holding shares though because I like the stock.

Now that everything is clear, I just want to highlight potential ways Wall Street may use to take away your tendies if you are a GME investor and how you can protect yourself. This is my opinion based on what I observe and nothing else:

#  Potential price supression by hedge funds

Thursday and Friday volume (purple circle) was really low in contrast to previous days (Monday to Wednesday) when the squeeze started (green circle). This means two things:

1. Everybody held the line. Short Squeeze has not even started.
2. What happened on Thursday and Friday seems to be blatant market manipulation to supress the price without the participation of retail investors. Obviously I can not prove this, but volume is the smoking gun. There are also some other posts in wsb that show how short sellers are selling longs to cover shorts (maybe that is why the rest of the market has been red the last two days?)

&#x200B;

[GME hourly chart](https://preview.redd.it/t8cyoo6iuhe61.png?width=1721&format=png&auto=webp&s=f09cfffc3a89f119a34f6988a01410b9c69fa44d)

 

So hedge funds could try to keep the price supressed for weeks or months by restricting retail participation. This is how they ~~ban~~ discourage people from buying and encourage selling.

**HOW YOU CAN PROTECT YOURSELF**: if you want to invest consider buying the stock or if you prefer call options, spread them between different maturities. The worst thing that can happen is that you buy weeklies OTM and they expire worthless, this is how they drain your capital and outlast retail investors. If your broker does not allow you to buy, open an account into another broker.

# Mainstream Media Misinformation

We have seen CNBC manipulating what is happening and trying to spread the narrative that retail investors don't know what to do. They are trying to push the narrative that retail traders don't know what to do and it smells to me like Wall Street is going to ask to shut down forums like this one and limit access to leverage products such as options.

You can find a great interview with Chamath where he literally destroy the CNBC reporter on YouTube (just type ""Chamath GME, AMC"" and you will find it).

**HOW YOU CAN PROTECT YOURSELF**: be careful with posting loss porn from GME options, after Thursday price manipulation where lots of people that bought ATM and OTM options ~~were robbed by hedge funds while retail investors could not participate in the market~~ lost money, they may use these posts on TV and twist them like ""*they lose money because they gamble and they do not know what they are doing therefore it is necessary some regulation in place to limit access to leverage products as they can not take care of themselves*""

# RobinHood or other brokerage services potential bankruptcies

I posted about this yesterday but inmediately deleted the post due to panic it caused (it was not my intention, sorry).

RobinHood funds are covered by FDIC which means your money is safe in the event of bankruptcy, but what I am not so sure (maybe someone can clarify) is, in the event of bankruptcy what would happen to your portfolio.

Aparently RobinHood liquidated some positions for different users without their consent (you can find posts in wsb related to that), so maybe they can liquidate your holdings at market price, give you the money and that's all (this is just pure speculation from mi side). Now, if they do this while retail traders are not allowed to participate, hedge funds could buy your shares at whatever price they want and cover their shorts. Given that Citadel is their main client I would not rule out this possibility.

I know this is too much speculation but could be a potential scenario given what happened on Thursday may have happened because the GME trade caused a systemic risk in the whole US financial markets due to leverage on hedge funds that went short (people have also written other posts about this in wsb).

Under this scenario RobinHood would be sacrified. Short Sellers would cover at the price they moreless want and any potential amount you have on your account not covered by RobinHood would be covered by FDIC (aka the american tax payer... sounds familiar, maybe like 2008 again?)

There is a video on YouTube about this topic in the Meet Kevin channel (seems the guy is quite popular in US).

**HOW YOU PROTECT YOURSELF**: I don't know what you can do in this scenario. Just hold your shares because if you want to transfer them to another broker maybe they also liquidate your positions (not sure about this, if anyone can confirm please, that would be great). Obviously, once GME squeeze is over, get out of RobinHood. If you want to buy GME, you can do it from other brokers.

**TLDR**: If you invested in GME. HOLD. DONT PANIC SELL. NEVER.

Nothing has changed, the short squeeze has not even started.

Be careful with weeklies, this could last weeks or months, better buy the stonk or spread across different maturities.

Get out of RobinHood once the GME short squeeze is over.

The results speak for themselves.

I have not participated in a more meaningful movement in my entire life. It is not The Law, it is Their Law. And in the words of The Prodigy: Fuck 'em, and their law. We followed their rules, then they changed the rules at the last minute to protect themselves.

The system has always been rigged. The only path to change was from within, and we found the key. **Those in power have chosen this as the only solution, it will be their undoing.** They will burn it down themselves, before we do, out of spite for us, to prevent us from taking more than the stale crumbs. We need to take it all away from them before that.

Our next moves are important. We continue the GME squeeze to completion. We proceed to squeeze the other over-shorted stocks. This hunt will be limited from now on in effectiveness now that they are aware and had a market manipulation event in their favor to minimize exposure. Also note the stocks that were gems but heavily shorted so 'tutes could take all the cheap shares for themselves (BB/NOK/PLTR). We now have to contend with their counter-moves. I am anticipating a tree-shake to rout out weak retail so they can lessen our forces. Regulations talks will probably be the catalyst.

We need to think in terms of countering their moves, not following common ""wisdom"". I have a feeling derivatives will be our key here, they offer the leverage and domino effect we can capitalize on. There will be a move away from standard assets as confidence in the old market disintegrates. We will see more crypo and precious metals plays. I am unfamiliar enough with forex/futures to predict their roles, but I welcome ideas.

We have pressed them into playing their entire hand, they will now make desperate moves that we can counter since they cannot afford the time to apply their boomer-scam-tactics as effectively as in the past.

Brothers, fr√®res, hermanos: our victory is afoot. Godspeed and may DFV watch over us.

I had a couple shares back at $20, had paper hands, and sold. I went all in a couple of days ago. Despite it only being a couple of days, I've been lurking here for a bit. The amount of 6 figure, 7 figure, and 8 figure gains I was seeing was blowing my mind. More than that, it was blowing my mind that nobody was selling. I thought, ""you made a 7 figure profit, what more do you want?"" Now that I'm all in, I've been staying more up to date with the things that are happening. And now I get it. I understand why nobody is selling. 

I just saw a video of a billionaire saying it's unfair what's going on. I saw a billionaire say, ""he's just trying to make a living"". I saw an article call WSB an alt-right hate group. I havent seen one billionaire against this movement speak on the recession of 2008. But I have seen stories in WSB of families deteriorating by the days because of the recession. I've seen blatant market manipulation to keep the common man from trading. I've seen countless slanders and whining over the last couple of weeks.

 
You know what else I've seen during this time? I saw a guy on here donate switches to St. Jude. I saw a different guy donate money to St. Jude. I saw a guy pay for his dogs surgery. I saw a dude pay off his student loans. I saw a CEO donate it all to a charity for small businesses. I've seen somebody be able to buy a place after living in their car. 


This is all so much bigger than money. That's cliche as fuck, but God it's true. I'm stuck between my blood boiling and my eyes watering. Honestly, I don't have a huge investment into Gamestop. Its not like my shares alone hold any bearing on Melvin making this out alive or not - but it's all I have. I went from freaking out over losing $100 in a day, to losing thousands in a day and just kinda smirking. 

To be honest, I planned on getting out if it hit $1000. But IM NOT GETTING OUT. Truthfully, I'll survive without this money if it tanks. Obviously money would be nice, but I know some others out there probably need it more. All that I do ask, if you do make it out of this not holding the bag, please do something good with your profits. Please don't turn into the greedy leeches on wall street. 


tl;dr - I like this stock. I like you all. Big like, no sell

**In this DD I will highlight how the short float % has been increasing over time in BB.**   


[Short float &#37; - Latest data from https:\/\/fintel.io\/ss\/us\/bb ](https://preview.redd.it/sclkg9ivshe61.png?width=2546&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae126d58d0126fd86b28f80ce22eb5f81f4b358f)

As can be seen in this picture, the short float % has been steadily increased over time as the price continues to go up. This could indicate that the shorts have been losing a ton of money, and is now trying to double down. However, this is nowhere near GME or AMC levels but could increase a lot more over time as seen in how much the short volume has increased these last couple of days. 

&#x200B;

[Short volume interest - Latest data from https:\/\/fintel.io\/ss\/us\/bb ](https://preview.redd.it/p7urdnrjuhe61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=99c6f6397db19891afddf34baff974d7269385c9)

As seen in this picture you can clearly see that the short volume has been increasing over time, and will most likely have an effect on how much the short float % currently is. Since the latest data for the short float % is from the 15th of January, we would have to wait for the 9th of February to see newly updated data on the short float %. 

  
The question is now, will they keep shorting BB into oblivion as they did with GME and AMC?   


**It's also important to look at the options flow and the possibility of a gamma squeeze.**  

[Graph from: u\/Strig1 ](https://preview.redd.it/dkcek800whe61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9388763aca6f8fa1109d460f6831034d107242b)

This week we saw something that very well could have been manipulation of the price based upon how many calls that would expire ITM of the price was above $30. They kept the price under $15 to let all these contracts expire OTM. But how does the options table looks like next week? See picture below

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/BB\/options\/](https://preview.redd.it/ra9imjdzwhe61.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3e8fa9c42368fc23590bd56ef2d8875385d137d)

As seen in this picture there are far fewer calls OTM next week compared to this week. So I would think that the stock price has a better chance of moving higher this week. However the possibility of a Gamma squeeze next week is small but if the price can get above $25 there is a chance to see a push upwards due to call sellers buying back shares to cover.

(not really sure how that works). One way to stop this is to put a limit order on it, but that is stupid cause some places like fidelity only allows up to 50% and we don't want to sell it for cheap 500$

What can be done?
Call up your broker and ask them to not lend out any of your shares. 

  ""not allow any lending of any of my stocks or funds.""   They honored that immediately and are mailing a letter stating such. 1-3 business days for delivery. I couldn't be happier with Fidelity.
-u/johnanon2015


What are some of the limits of limit order by other platforms?

TLTR: üíéüëê
ONLY limit sell if you are setting at really high price. Like $42,069
Call brokers if you are limited and tell them to not lend it out

You guys have positioned yourselves to be in the best position imaginable tocapitalize on a perfect scenario that will explode your customer base and membership moving forward. 

You still have one mountain to climb, however.

YOUR USER INTERFACE IS EMBARRASSINGLY TERRIBLE. I am well aware of the time, effort, energy, and capital you‚Äôve spent building your app and website over the years, and that‚Äôs great. However, RobinHood has walked the fucking dog on you when it comes to simplicity, ease of use, and approachability. They‚Äôve brought millions of new investors to the market, and have had world changing successes of which I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre all well aware of (you know, like when they changed the game my forcing you to make trades free?).

I‚Äôm a Gen X Millennial, and although I may be able to adapt to your convoluted-ass website and mobile app, a lot of the future investors will not have the patience or inclination to do the same. *You have to change it, and do it quickly.* It needs to be sleek, modern, and user-friendly. You don‚Äôt have to copy RobinHood (hell, why would you want to?), but you do have to come up with something that can keep the influx of new customers from jumping ship once their aboard, and **I‚Äôm not talking about making it hard for us to leave, you have to make it easy for us to stay.**

The last week‚Äôs debacle is as best an opportunity as you‚Äôll ever have to catapult yourself into the front of your industry. It‚Äôs the World Series, bottom of the 9th, the bases are loaded, and you‚Äôre down by 3. RobinHood is pitching with a broken arm, and you are the batter with the .989 average.

&#x200B;

For the prices they are selling PUTS and CALLS at the 325 strike price (expiring 5th Feb) upper bound is roughly $575 and the lower $75 ( Purple line) . This is the full straddle price the MM is getting for the options they are selling. Once price goes over this level they start to lose money. 

**They are not expecting price to go above or below these levels otherwise they would have made the options more expensive.**

Usually the MMs try not to hedge as its expensive and is cheaper for them to defend those levels  and /or will rely on the gamma scalpers to start shorting the stock at the call line or the top boundary purple line. Traders who have bought the 325 Calls will have a lot of value in those options and can short the stock risk free if they still have time value left on the option.

However if the MMs think that the levels wont be shorted and there is too much long value in the stock they will buy to hedge themselves.

This however is not a normal market at the moment.

Anyway some levels to watch next week to see if they try defend.

GME to the moon etc etc

Short version: Market is increasingly propped up to cushion the fall / secure the retirement for the elite boomers. No dollars have been printed by the Fed. ""Stimulus"" is really emergency aid to avoid rioting. There are NO SIGNS of inflation, let alone reflation happening anytime soon in the US.

This won't apply to most of you, but it probably applies to *some* of you.

Alright morons, listen up. Law student here who has grown fond of wsb through lurking for quite a while. There are some legal issues you need to be aware of if you are, or have been, making moves with GME/the other meme stocks right now. These issues range from civil to criminal, so you should probably read this. I‚Äôll put a TL;DR at the bottom if words are hard for you.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

First of all, I am *not* an attorney (yet), and you should not rely solely on this post to make any decisions at all. **You should talk to a real lawyer** if you think you might need legal advice. More on that below.

I‚Äôm going to provide some short summaries of cases along with an excerpt from a relevant legal journal that discuss some of the things I‚Äôve seen on wsb as of late, and if it sounds like you, **go talk to a lawyer.**

* ""The opportunity to violate securities laws on the internet is not limited to issuers. Even common stockholders can opt to violate the securities laws by using the internet to manipulate the markets.""¬†Christine Souhrada,¬†Securities Fraud, Market Manipulation, and the Internet, UCLA J.L. & Tech., 2002, at Notes 28

What that means in tendie-speak is that the SEC can come after *you* for some combination of your posts, comments and trades. This doesn‚Äôt mean they *will*, just that they *can.* Note: The SEC has an [Office of Internet Enforcement](http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/internetenforce.htm). Just because this is [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and the memes are good, you're not immune from real-world problems.

The SEC is not the only source of potential problems. They coordinate with lots of federal and state agencies. I‚Äôm not going to explain the law & procedure of 50 different state law enforcement apparatuses to you, because i'm fond of you, but not *that* fond. Also, like I mentioned above, you can be civilly liable for behavior that doesn't rise to the level of criminal.

The key to what the SEC calls market manipulation is ""causing enough investors to buy the target company's stock by disseminating **false information** to artificially inflate the stock price. *Id.* (See the above-referenced legal journal, that's what '*Id.'* means) This also applies to artificially deflating (by disseminating false information) if you hold a short position or a put, etc; this is the apparent business model of funds like Melvin, and yes, they should be the ones being looked at, but *should* doesn‚Äôt matter and I'm writing this for you, not them.

If you‚Äôve gotten caught up in the hype and memes, and have been disseminating false information in an effort to moon GME, you need to talk to a lawyer **now**. I can‚Äôt tell you if what you‚Äôve said is false or not, but a real lawyer can. The lynchpin of liability (tendie-speak: whether you have a problem on your hands) is the making of material misstatements or omissions to induce investors to purchase securities. See ¬ß17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, and ¬ß10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Here are some examples of people getting in to the crosshairs of the SEC via some of the above-described behavior:

* **S.E.C. v. Simmons**, 8:04-CV-2477-T-17MAP, 2008 WL 7935266 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 25, 2008)

Stock promoter acted with severe recklessness in predicting that a company's stock prices would rise to at least S15.00, yet selling his stock for a third of the price, which satisfied scienter element of the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws. Therefore, promoter engaged in securities fraud. Despite claiming that he posted cautionary warnings to potential investors on his posts on a website and stating that the posts were based on his enthusiasm for the company's future prospects, there was no evidence submitted, besides seller's deposition testimony, that the postings were pre-qualified with a cautionary statement warning potential investors to consider.

* **S.E.C. v. Masri**, 523 F. Supp. 2d 361, 365‚Äì66 (S.D.N.Y. 2007)

Defendants purchased 200,000 TZA shares on August 20, 1999, in order to push the price of TZA above $5, thus causing the TZA August 5 put options to expire worthless and avoid the required purchase of 860,000 shares at $5 per share

SDNY Court held that if an investor conducts an open-market¬†transaction with the intent of artificially affecting the price of the security, and not for any legitimate economic reason, it *can*constitute¬†market manipulation.

    ‚ÄúB-b-b-but I only relied on publicly available information!!11!‚Äù  

* Yeah, well, so did this guy: **Sec. & Exch. Comm'n v. Fiore**, 416 F. Supp. 3d 306 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) Promoter's reliance on corporation's public filings did **not** allow him to get out of the action filed against him by the SEC.

&#x200B;

    ‚ÄúNothing I did moved prices, I‚Äôm too small!‚Äù 

* Still a potential problem. **FindWhat Inv'r Group v. FindWhat.com**, 658 F.3d 1282 (11th Cir. 2011) Finding that confirmatory information that wrongfully prolongs a period during which stock is traded at inflated prices, even without increasing the level of inflation, may be actionable under the¬†securities¬†laws; that is, defendants may be liable for knowingly and intentionally causing a stock price to remain inflated by preventing preexisting inflation from dissipating from the stock price.¬†Securities¬†Exchange Act of 1934, ¬ß 10(b),¬†15 U.S.C.A. ¬ß 78j(b)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Lastly, if, after all of this, you find yourself several orders of magnitude richer than you were at the start: **TELL NO ONE. TALK  TO A TRUSTS AND ESTATES ATTORNEY IMMEDIATELY.** I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware of the issues that lotto winners find themselves dealing with. If you‚Äôve struck gold and are swimming in tendies, you are effectively a lotto winner, which means you are now a target. Even well-meaning people will try to help you spend your tendies. You need to retain counsel to figure out how you‚Äôre going to protect yourself from others.

Where the hell was this staunch worship of fundamentals when shorts were borrowing against gamestop to 140% in an effort to push the price down on an equity that quite literally reached a price to book ratio of 0.40? These fucking idiots harp on about fundamentals, but don't have anything to say about a hedge fund exposing itself 10x over to try and push a stock down further than literally less than it's liquidated cash/inventory value.

Similarly, where was this concern for an exit strategy when those same hedge fund shorts were sitting at huge profits? Why didn't they take profits? Where was this concern for an exit strategy when the stock turned a corner and new boardmembers were appointed? Where was the exit strategy when Melvin, Citron, Etc lost 100% of their position, or 200%, or 500%. Where was the exit strategy when they got bailed out for 2 billion and still doubled down on the position? Where was the exit strategy when they quite literally put our equity markets on the verge of a liquidity crisis?

These fucking hypocritical idiots love to throw these things around now that one of the worst trades in history went sideways on them. Where were all these values and disciplines when they made their idiotic trade? Why didn't their prime broker force an exit strategy on them? I sure as shit know my broker would have stepped in a lot sooner. Why didn't theirs? Did their idiotic broker not realize that in a functioning market they are ultimately the last buck and bagholders in this if Melvin becomes insolvent?

Everything about this from their idiotic trade to their response smells like total bullshit.  


EDIT:

PS: I LIKE GME AND AMC AND IM NOT SELLING

My risk tolerance on this position is infinite. Collectively we have extremely diversified and pooled risk across literally millions of people throwing a few hundred or thousand bucks at the thing. The dumb fucks on the other side of this trade have miniscule risk tolerance, massive leverage, and extremely concentrated positions that risk entire hedge funds. No matter how much they try to convince us that we're in a dangerous position, the absolute worst thing that happens to us is we each lose some bullshit money in a diversified loss spread across literally millions of people. All of whom will sleep soundly at night knowing we fought a good fight. The idiots on the other side of this trade stand to lose their oligarchy. They stand to lose entire hedge funds on the behalf of other billionaires who were too lazy to read the prospectus of the hedge fund that just lost tons of their money.

I took Nasdaq data on OI (for the newbies, that's open interest - numbers of contracts out there in the market) for each strike ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain)) and calculated the value at expiration (\[closing price - strike price\] \* 100 shares/contract \* OI = total gain/loss those positions generated).

Current float is like 50.65M ([https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME)) so that means if 9.25M shares get assigned, 18% of float will now change hands as a result.

In the interest of consistency, and because everybody needs to be chipping in right now, here‚Äôs the scans that caught my eye today heading into next week. Mondays are my best days so Ill have way more then, EOD.

üê≥üßê**Overall, whales kept betting on tech to bounce back heavily**, in convincing style (signals that indicated the call blocks were more than just hedging). Image links are call blocks from each. **Intitial research is often with barchart, but I always check for confirmation with Unusual Whales**

[FB](https://i.imgur.com/A0R2dz2.jpg) üöÄüöÄüöÄ: until the bitter end today, people were feverishly pumping call blocks with puts aligning them. If tech bounces back, FB in particular is due for a rip after correcting post-earnings

[Unusual whales confirmation: look at this March call order](https://i.imgur.com/nQ6WcFN.jpg)

[SQ](https://i.imgur.com/40VDFnM.jpg) üöÄüöÄ: consistent bullish call volume all week. People thought they fished the bottom yesterday but got curbed by the blood red index day

[Unusual Whales research confirmation: strong 2/5 call block ](https://i.imgur.com/H7onSWz.jpg)

[DKNG](https://i.imgur.com/wapFAGh.jpg) üöÄüöÄ: lots of sporadic call clusters like this. PENN gets most of the glory, but there are a lot of catalysts coming around state regulations soon. Load up some 2/26 and wait for the pop

[Unusual Whales research confirmation: repeated weeklies each week, such as this. ](https://i.imgur.com/imHvK1O.jpg)

[AMZN](https://i.imgur.com/bfCXbJj.jpg) üöÄüöÄüöÄ: the bulls are buying calls heavily in anticipation of earnings. If you think you know what a good beat is, just wait for AMZN Christmas results

[Ununsual Whales?: yep](https://i.imgur.com/3R6pPLI.jpg)

BONUS: sporadic FDX call orders have come in. After an oversell for FDX recently, AMZN sympathy is plausible based on orders.

[Unusual Whales spotted a sneaky FDX call order for 2/12](https://i.imgur.com/JX0HwyD.jpg)

[INTC](https://i.imgur.com/F2SUHPy.jpg) üöÄ : yes. I know INTC can be awful. But tons of pump since the ER. they have a new CEO everyone is excited about now, and look to have found a bottom. I like this.

[Unusual Whales spotted this INTC call block got 2/5](https://i.imgur.com/aRBlrRY.jpg)

**Tech grab bag:**

**ZNGA PINS CRM SNAP FSLY**
EDIT: I forgot AMD

 **All HEAVY volume and look great for ERs coming off this tech drubbing.** Very bullish call flow.

**EDIT/UPDATE:** /u/lordofoptions has sold me on **SENS**

Hope this gives you some confirmation bias or ideas to look into.

**Inbox always open**: i was super busy this past week, but in light of recent crazy market/WSB events I will be checking frequently and am willing to bounce ideas, field questions.

**TLDR: Buy tech calls, because whales richer than you are doing just that.**

I have never used Plaid before, but apparently that's the how both Sofi and webull integrate your bank accounts for direct transfers these days.

Because I have a RH cash management account, and Plaid has RH listed as one of the bank options, I naturally wanted to transfer money out of RH through Plaid.

Apparently, I couldn't. I double and triple checked username/password. Through both Sofi and Webull, the plaid message goes ""Couldn't connect yo your institution"". Every other bank institution account worked, including Bofa, Chase, and some local credit union/banks. And I haved tried this numerous times over roughly the span of 12 hours.

I'm sorry if it bores you, I saw that story from that dude that posted how his dad lost almost everything during 2008 and I wanted to share my own.


Sorry for my bad English.


Hello WSB, I last post around half a year ago on how the US Stock Market helped me get closer to my dream of being able to support my family with an average country wage of 150USD a month.

I got a ton of encouragement and advices from everyone back then which I immensely appreciated. Now that the GME phenomenon has spreaded over the globe, even here (although we actually cannot help you guys without a lot of trouble like I went through, more below)


So to recap, I saved up 2000 USD ever since I was young uptil now (I'm 21 now), working ever since I was in elementary school, money was all I had in mind ever since our country got hit with the 2008 depression and my family was struggling.


Backstory:


I've always loved PC and paid close attention to it so when their new Ryzen series leaks start getting out in 2016 and I got to test them out while working part time, I took a look at their stock. It was trading at around 2 I think.


So with my excitement I was eager to join the market, I asked my uncle who was a stock investor and his reply was ""The market is rigged, don't join it"". I was stumbed. He lost a lot in 2008, maybe that was why.


So after a month of research, it appears there is no legit way for me to invest in the US market, or actually to any market aside our own. Our banks wouldn't even let us wire money overseas without a reason they deem acceptable. But here's the thing, the hedge funds here can. That was the first unfair thing I witness about limiting the little guy ability to get somewhere in life.


In the end, I couldn't find a way to get in and watched as AMD make it meteoric rise over the past few years. It was really depressing thinking back on how the profit could've helped my family.


Fast forward to 2020, I finally found a way to make a foreign account with TD and have a friend overseas that can help me fund the account, I just need to send him money through epayment. The fees was high, not to mention since we can't use ACH because we're transferring to TD from his account, it cost me somewhere a total of around 50 USD for the money to land in my account.


But after all that I managed to get into the market, I grinded through all the courses on TD and read all the posts from various subs. But life is never that smooth.


Around that time, I saw a post of a member on here using his profit to pay for another fellow member tuition. That inspired me, I wanted to do that so badly, first for my brother.



The Beer Virus Crash:


I joined the market at Feb 28th 2020. Yes, right at the top before we drill straight through earth core because of the beer viruses. I almost lost it all, I switched between puts and calls as I see fit but in the end, I came out with 200USD left. I thought I was the unluckiest guy on earth. It was tiring, since we're on opposite end of the timezone, I usually finish school or work then trare until around 2 or 4am. All that and ending up with huge loss was devastating. Thinking back, I should've pulled out when I was seeing my money losing everyday.


The corona started affecting our country, we did a great job at handling it but I can tell my parents were fearing for their jobs. I put myself back together and get back in with my 200, slowly grinding up back to 2000. It was arduous but when I finally got back to breakeven, it felt amazing. Because I'm not starting again, I'm starting again with experience.


Sadly, by this time, my father lost his job due to corporate politics/dirty-play. I won't get into details but basically there was some bad people doing bad things to try to frame others, it's been going on for years. In the end, he was proven innocent but the corporate still let him go to ""keep the image of the company"". And guess what, he never get a job anymore no matter how many times he gets to those final interviews. We both know that it was because they made him as scapegoat and whenever a new company contact his old one, they would he put off. To them, it's much better to scapegoat one person than to say ""We let a guy sabotaging our employees and company for years without being able to do anything"".


After all the failed job opportunity he decided to give the stock market a try. It was going well. We don't have advance options and we also don't allow ""legal"" shorting here. But as we'll soon find out, it's only a rule for us commoners..


Basically, shorting is not a thing here but hedgefunds or sharks can always call each other and borrow shares to short. I've witness quite a few short ladder attack. 


And since we don't have options, we don't have the ability to buy puts to hedge our account but I am sure the big guy has their ways of getting them


You can tell by this point I have a lot of bottled up contempt for suits.


GME and the global movement:


And that brings us to this unprecedented time. I didn't get into GME soon enough (4 GME shares at 150 cost basis) my money was tired up in Spreade for BB and Nok expiring last Friday which was rather deep ITM (I had BB 21/22C and BB hit a peak of 28 last week). And as we all know, by abusing their power yet again, they tanked the price and those trades are now worthless. But I held GME, I held through their attacks when it tankee to 100 because you guys were holding with me.


So now all I have is 4 GME shares that I will hold until we can get back at them and WHEN, not if, we win, hopefully it will help me somewhat in investing in this market - that hopefully will be a lot more fair after all of this.


A lot of people I know are asking to join and I've been helping them setting up accounts on TDA or eToro. Etoro is faster to get started but they kinda suck. Since there are no way for us to get Fractional Shares (eToro been wonky), some of my friends are putting money together to hold one shares of GME on Monday.


I look forward to the day we win this, so many things are on the line, not just for our generation, but our previous and future generations, not just for the US stock market but for all market as well as everything unfairness in the world. In the end, we might win the battle of GME but still not win much from this war of unfairness but that's a start.


So to conclude this stupid long TEDtalk. You have reinforcement from everywhere WSB. Even from places that cost 2 months wages for a share.


Let's make them pay for what they took from us and my brother tuition also! 10k per share is not a meme!!!


TLDR: Poor kid from 3rd world country holding GME because suits treated his family badly.

The question is, how much more will people pay for GameStop branded merchandise, compared
to a month ago.

GameStop's value is in that it represents rebellion and a striving for fairness- not only from the original short interest, but even more from the media and hedgies blaming retain investors.

Perhaps a stock price of $100 isn't sustainable, but $50 may be.

And this would still obliterate the hedgies, as their positions would still cost them 10-15 x their shorts, and 50-100x the calls they sold.

And if GameStop could demonstrate the legitimacy of this valuation, it would prevent SEC shenanigans that release short interest of their obligations.

ITT we brainstorm what products GameStop could brand, with the cache of their brand.
My vote is a GameStop-branded BlackBerry phone, specializing in simple games, or a unique social chat app.

Here are some others, not my own:

I could foresee a Blackberry/GameStop ecosystem that, shunned by Google, could be a good barrier to normies.

Earnings per share were at $1.68 vs the estimated $1.41. It's also important to note that sales in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are up 57%.

But what happened? You ask, like a wide eyed retard fresh outta mommies cunt. We've all seen this shit before, blowout earning report and a steep sell off straight afterwards.

The reason I believe the recovery will be swift is because this sell off was almost certainly caused by a few big funds needing liquidity to cover their GME shorts + short more GME. Also autists liquidating their positions to buy more gme. This dip will be bought right back up by institutions that have no interest in GME.

TLDR: We are this way, because it's the only way we are allowed to be, as retail traders.

Now that that's out of the way, lets look at it from a normie traders point of view.

&#x200B;

1. **Pattern Day Trading:** Why does it exist? To protect us? From what? Do you ask for a W2 for everyone literally walking into a casino to see if they are capable of losing what they are risking? No, they are free to spend as they please. Funny, I thought that's what a free market was for too?
2. **Market Makers:** You want us to literally just stop, leave, and use a casino? Use DraftKings and that sort of platform, ok. Now what, how do you make your money off of ""dumb money"" when it's gone? You need us, we need you.
3. **\*WHY\* is a collective of people on Reddit such a danger?:** For the sake of arguing, before this happened, there were 800,000 of us just being collectively dumb together. LETS JUST SAY, combined, we had 1 billion dollars between 800,000 people. That's scary? You lost 2.7b in the first wave of short losses, then asked for help for another 3b. Do you know what that means? THAT MEANS, that hedge funds, as a collective, is the problem, NOT REDDIT.
4. **When we got together, it was a crime, when you got together, it was not a problem?** How can we be ""investors"" in a rigged game, literally, please explain it. We HAVE TO GAMBLE to make money, because those are YOUR RULES.
5. **Trading is passive income, not a job:** Yeah, it's a passive way to kill time for 95% of us, make a little side money, couple grand here or there, sometimes get lucky and make 10k. This is a lot for regular people, it's literally NOTHING to you, but debt payment and vacation funds for us.
6. **We are Degenerates and Dumb Money:** If a large group of dumb people cost you money is a problem...then why is a large group of smart people (you market makers and hedge funds) that manipulate costs to take dumb moneys money away, allowed?

Anyways, there is a list 3 miles long.

GameStop isn't about GameStop, it's a beacon of reason, it could have been any stock, Citron just picked the target and we used it.

Good Luck Diamond Handing gents. Think about it this way. No matter what happens, **THEY HAVE LOST MORE MONEY THIS MONTH**, than what average day traders have collectively made in 5 years.

I have personally been reading and participating in WSB since we were around 600K strong.  Seeing the explosive growth here recently) is unreal.

The media coverage is also unreal.  Unfortunately, some are painting the group as a monolithic entity -- a raging, disgraceful mob bent on destruction.

Sure - some of the language here is obscene and the culture is undeniably childish.  But let me tell you some of the stuff I've seen:

&#x200B;

\*Multiple stories of members who have used profits to buy Nintendos for children's hospitals, food for health care workers, donations to charities, etc.  This has happened many times before when members made large profits on other positions.  How many hedge fund managers would have done the same had they bankrupted GME?

\*A doctor (maybe a surgeon?) had a long-standing position on $AMD and made a significant profit.  He posted about it one day and folks were jokingly asking for money  (the typical ""hi, it's me your son...."" approach).  One person mentioned they were a medical student with a huge amount of loans.  The doctor contacted him personally, gave him advice, and helped with $ for loans.

\*Recently, a gentleman living in his car posted how he had placed $600 on GME call options now worth >$100,000.  The mantra here has been hold, hold, hold with anyone selling facing the potential of a relentless onslaught of insults.  In in this case, countless members encouraged him to cash out at least some of the position to afford housing, food, and warmth.  Countless posts of support and well wishes.  

\*Likewise, folks posted support and congratulatory messages for someone who was able to secure some profits and buy delayed christmas presents that were unobtainable.  The sheer joy in his post and his newfound ability to bring happiness to others was heartwarming.

\*Countless posts of support.  While everyone here messes around with everyone else, there is actually a really nice undercurrent where when someone is in real trouble, there is countless outpouring of support.

&#x200B;

Now - with countless bots and new accounts with unclear motives, these types of things are harder to find.  But it is important that this subreddit not be portrayed as a group of $Yahoos or a mob or whatever else the talking heads on financial news networks (with now overtly obvious motives) are saying."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185637.csv|StockTicker|['WSB', 'I']|[]|['I', 'WSB', 'K', 'GME', 'A', '$AMD', 'GME']|['GME', 'AMD', 'GME']

TL:DR: HOLD

Get ready for FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) campaigns on the weekend. It's already starting.

The number of posts with supposed ""level headed"" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think, how other stocks are also valuable, and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but still ""Go GME!! I am one of you guys!"", always with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.

Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your GME shares.

ALWAYS check the up / downvote ratio and read the comments before getting swayed by whatever semi correct sounding bullshit they're spouting. Oh how desperate they now have become.

Melvin and others who are doing the ladder shorts, scaring a few to get shares but not enough to save themselves.  Ive read that Melvin and others are paying 3% daily interest on their shorts. 

Lets assume a $1B short that went against them to the tune of $10B in losses. They are effectively paying 3% or $300M a day to maintain that short. Only they can't get out because there are no true sellers, just bullshit ladder games by other shorters. Eventually Melvin cannot pay that $300M ($1.5B a week) margije requirement. The price increases and their short goes red $20B, now they have $600M a day to carry the short. Just can't continue.  

So they become insolvent, and a bigger firm assumes the risk of their short. GME hits $10K a share and now that bigger firm has a $3B a day margin risk! They go down. 

Two ways this works out for the shorts, 1, enough people cash out so they can cover. 2 Gamestop themselves sell massive shares into the frenzy. They get to Cohen and he releases millions of shares, GME files an action to raise capital to restructure and sells 100M shares to do that (directly to hedges at a predetermined price so they can cover).

Why not? Well: 

Let me clear up some misinformation: market makers don‚Äôt buy shares all at once on Friday when the calls expire in the money; that would be fucking stupid. In simple terms, they buy as the chance of the call ending in the money rises (aka the stock price goes up), so they buy slowly on the days leading up to the expiration date. Their problem is that there is not enough liquidity in the market to have bought enough shares properly when those calls get exercised on Tuesday. 

Next week is going to be the biggest week in my opinion. And if they didn‚Äôt close robinhood, we would be gamma squeezed up to 700-800 by now or even more. But they did illegal shit to get away with it, and delayed the inevitable. Our friends at robinhood will have hopefully liquidated and switched brokers by Monday and set off the gamma squeeze paired with the call exercises on Tuesday and MM‚Äôs not having enough shares hedged properly to deliver. My opinion. 


You know the reason why they didn‚Äôt try that short naked ladder attack like they did that drive the price from 480 to 120 again yesterday??? Because we didn‚Äôt fucking sell. It wasn‚Äôt low enough for them to close very many short positions.

Looking at volume, at 120, nobody fucking sold. People probably bought the dip and took more shares off the market instead. They know that, that‚Äôs why they didn‚Äôt try to use it to bring the price to 120 again yesterday, and only kept it in the 250 ish range. that moment made me FUCKING TRUST YOU GUYS SO MUCH. The fact that MAJORITY STILL DID NOT SELL IS UNBELIEVABLE. They‚Äôre probably thinking the same thing. 

They‚Äôre literally shitting their pants. They have every professional risk analyst, Harvard data scientist, Harvard mathematicians, and the best financial analysts in the world working on this. 

Unless the SEC or FED step in (I don‚Äôt think the SEC will: https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/01/29/sec-reviewing-recent-trading-volatility-amid-gamestop-frenzy-vows-to-protect-retail-investors.html) They have no choice but to make us sell‚Äî and the only way they are going to do this is by psychologically torturing us until we do it. Bots spamming shit, robinhood cancelling, CNBC spreading fucking fear everywhere, short naked ladder attacks. 





TLDR ‚Å∫ THE ANSWER? üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Turn your fucking brain OFF. trust the process. Ignore EVERYTHING you see that comes from the media, and more importantly don‚Äôt let any fluctuations in the price faze you, IT IS ALL ARTIFICIAL DESPERATE ATTEMPTS AT SURVIVING. Trust the fact that these shitheads are working literally this next 48 hour weekend straight and sweating and screaming and crying and begging for bailouts, and meeting behind closed doors to come up with more shitty tactics, which won‚Äôt work on us because were NEVER FUCKING SELLING. We sit at home with the shares jerking off and spending our time chilling, while they‚Äôre in emergency overdrive mode. The fact that we have RETAIL INVESTORS who are willing to lose the money to prove a point, and are not scared, and don‚Äôt understand that much is ACTUALLY OUR BIGGEST ADVANTAGE RIGHT NOW. 

IMPORTANT:

don‚Äôt get burnt out or they WIN. I watch the ticker all day from 8 to 5:30. It‚Äôs so draining and I cannot keep it up forever WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT. come Monday, I am not looking at the stock until 1. I‚Äôm going to exercise, eat healthy shit, drink water, spend time with the family and set some time aside NOT thinking about GME. The exact thing they want is that we lose momentum or get stressed out and sell to ease our mind. Don‚Äôt let them win. 


I own GME, this is purely speculation, I don‚Äôt know anything for certain, and it is all my opinion. I like the stock, and believe in its fundamentals and leadershiP.


 E D I T: THINKING ABOUT NOT LEAVING Robinhood yet for one reason or another? 

Copied from my response to a comment below about someone saying it would take too long to liquidate and move to robinhood: 

Don‚Äôt liquidate your GME holdings, just take your extra cash you want to put in to GME and put it in another broker account ASAP. 

Robinhood is completely controlled by the person we‚Äôre fighting against. When we had momentum yesterday, they changed the 5 share buy max to 2 then to 1. They will always kill momentum because they are owned by the people we are fighting against. They will never allow you to buy again. 

In my opinion you should have switched brokers the moment this news came out. I think you can get it set up for Tuesday which I believe will be the biggest day. Letting us by 5 then 2 then 1 share? They have professional analysts; they know the limit that can be bought for them to be successful; and they can control the buying limit. if they can do this; they are basically guaranteed a win. They are controlled by the big guys, you have to get OUT."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185631.csv|StockTicker|['RE', 'CKING', 'CARED']|[]|['CKING', 'TRUST', 'YOU', 'GUYS', 'SO', 'MUCH', 'ORITY', 'STILL', 'DID', 'NOT', 'SELL', 'IS', 'VABLE', 'SEC', 'FED', 'I', 'SEC', 'CNBC', 'TLDR', 'THE', 'NSWER', 'OFF', 'THING', 'IT', 'IS', 'ALL', 'ICIAL', 'ERATE', 'EMPTS', 'AT', 'IVING', 'NEVER', 'CKING', 'LLING', 'ETAIL', 'STORS', 'UALLY', 'OUR', 'GGEST', 'NTAGE', 'RIGHT', 'NOW', 'WIN', 'I', 'I', 'WHICH', 'IS', 'ACTLY', 'WHAT', 'THEY', 'WANT', 'I', 'NOT', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'P', 'E', 'D', 'I', 'NKING', 'ABOUT', 'NOT', 'AVING', 'GME', 'GME', 'ASAP', 'I', 'I', 'OUT']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

I know for the fact that it's going to be my biggest ""wisha woulda shoulda coulda"" regret I will be telling my grand children in future.

I watched the whole $GME saga from sidelines for past couple months and I am happy for all you retards making banks.

It's just my 30K annual salary, my stupid ass risk appetite and ever lasting debt doesn't allow me to hop on a 300$ a share price at this point. (I am in \~15K debt to be clear). Have nearly 1000$ worth spread out in $AMC $BB $NOK just because you retards suggested it and I wanted to be with you guys on (somewhat possibly) next rocket.

My rational mind tells me the $GME price's gonna go up 1000$+ mark and my ""woulda shoulda coulda"" is gonna get more intensified. But, my convicted mind tells me to keep watching from sidelines and support my fellow autistic retard buddies.

I just want to speak out one thing loud and clear to all the guys who got in at no matter what price. Just keep on Holding for your Dear Life.

All the GME left-outers love to watch the game and see hedge funds getting burned. Just burn 'em all.

The feelings of selling my grandpa's hand-made 30 year old house back in 2008 crisis and living on rent in a basement for next 5-7 years still burns my heart to ashes each time I think about it. I was a small kid back then but now I understand all of it. Every single thing.

**HEDGEFUND RISK**

First understand what's at risk for the hedge funds.  [According to S3 analytics,](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/gamestop-short-sellers-are-still-not-surrendering-despite-nearly-20-billion-in-losses-this-year.html) HFs have lost $20B on $GME so far.  Other reports have come out that [hedge funds have lost 15-20% of assets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/dan-sundheim-s-20-billion-d1-capital-loses-about-20-this-month#:~:text=Dan%20Sundheim's%20D1%20Capital%20Partners,target%20hedge%20funds'%20favorite%20positions) so far this year.  Using these two numbers we can make an estimate they have $80B at stake here ([Citadel was worth $33B on Jan. 1st](https://www.citadel.com/about-citadel/#:~:text=We%20achieve%20far%20more%20together%20than%20we%20ever%20could%20on%20our%20own.&text=Citadel%20named%20to%20Linkedin's%20Top,as%20of%20January%201%2C%202021) so I believe this to be close).  Because Citadel and Melvin struck a deal, we can assume they are all in this together.  This prevents a [prisoners dilemma](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prisoners-dilemma.asp#:~:text=The%20prisoner's%20dilemma%20is%20a,expense%20of%20the%20other%20participant) for any one of them and makes retail investors battle $80B vs. say an individual worth $2B.

Now let's assume short amount is 100% of float and they have reduced the high debt on Thursday's shady tactics.  This means to calculate daily interest we take:

* 50M shares in float ([according to Fin Viz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME))
* 25% interest rate = .25/365 = .07%/day
* Share Price = $300

$300\*.07%\*50M = $10.2M in interest/day.

At $300 share price and $80B in funds as long as they continue to acquire the minimum # of shares needed they can keep this up for ***21 years.***

*So that's their situation.  The question they are asking then is how do we improve our situation and ensure we gather enough shares to keep this going?*

&#x200B;

**HEDGEFUND GAME THEORY**

Ok so now assume you are a huge asshole that steals from poor people and has no respect for others.  You need ***shares*** and ***you want to exit your position so you can make money elsewhere***\*.\*  How do you do this?

There are three tactics likely:

1.	Settlement

* Let's go back to our shares needed (50M) and value of the hedge funds ($80B).  Dividing that out we see that if they pay $1600/share they would be bankrupt.
* To avoid bankruptcy but get out they likely will look for government intervention that has them pay $500-$1000/share
* So how would you do this?  You first use your friends to [convince retail investors that your share is worth less than $1K](https://twitter.com/realwillmeade/status/1355329408194719748).  Retail investors might even have an organization like [SEC say they are protecting us](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/sec-vows-protect-retail-investors-amid-gamestop-frenzy-n1256146) \- after all $500/share is more than retail investors paid.  You then settle behind the scenes with your cronies and come out with PR about how great this is! *(fuckers)*
* This is their best course of action because retail investors cannot do jack shit against it
* Edit: As others have pointed out the settlement could be with other hedge funds that own shares, not just government intervention 

&#x200B;

2A) Test Pricing - Low

* The first test they did was to see if they could scare us.  A [ladder attack](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l72r36/what_is_a_short_ladder_attack/) costs them nothing.  And if they keep price low enough they don't have to pay out on higher issued options.
* Clearly the ladder attack was very effective Thursday and Friday up until \~2:30pm (I'll explain why later).  I expect them to use this as needed to keep price in a range

&#x200B;

2B) Test Pricing - High

* Another strategy is to find a [price cliff](https://www.pricebeam.com/pricingpsychology#:~:text=A%20Price%20Cliff%20can%20be,share%20and%20revenue%20will%20drop).  Essentially they let price run up a bit and hope that everyone sells to lock in profits.  This is more risky and will be used cautiously.
* However I can't state this enough - **we might see price rise substantially on Monday in hopes that retail investors sell.**

&#x200B;

3) Work with GME to Issue Shares

* If they think buying is dying down, a share issuance allows them to grab a number of these shares and exit
* The reason this is not their best outcome is twofold: Retail investors can help subdue with a huge buy attack and GME has little incentive to upset a large portion of retail investors
* Still, keep your eyes out for this to happen as it will be a pivotal point

&#x200B;

Well this all sounds good and I need to get back to my yacht.  Let's do some price testing and call up our buddies to solve this in a couple weeks.  This can't go tits up.

*Wrong.  Retail Investors still have the power.*

&#x200B;

**RETAIL INVESTOR GAME THEORY**

So now you are a smooth-brained ape.  What can you do to stick it to the twats?

&#x200B;

1.	HOLD

* If everyone holds then HFs can't get shares.  This leads to a long, drawn out fight or settlement.  But guess what - at least the HFs are losing millions of $s a day and unable to screw around with other stocks
* This benefits the new retail investors because eventually your short-term gains become long-term gains (less taxes)

&#x200B;

2) BUY

* How do you prevent a wall of selling slowly lowering the price?  You build a wall of buying slowly raising the price!
* Whether you realize it or not retail investors almost lost Friday afternoon. RIs had two days where buying was diminished (fuck Robinhood) and therefore the ladder attack let HFs set whatever price they needed.  Thankfully retail investors pulled it off in the final minutes (maybe thanks to a whale)
* If retail investors continue to commit limit order buys to prevent the ladder attack from lowering price AND continue to adjust their limit order buys UP the price will go UP
* ***This is the most important though - the retail investor must commit to the idea that there is no longer a ""dip"".***  ***Price is now pre-squeeze and post-squeeze***
* If they can do this the retail investor wins.  The post-squeeze price will be where most retail investors want to sell (hopefully VERY HIGH) and all shares purchased post-squeeze will make profit

&#x200B;

3) FIND WHALES

* Anyone named Elon that wants to commit to the cause and also hates short sellers?

&#x200B;

4) DO IT QUICKLY

* HFs are spending 24/7 trying to find a way out.  The longer RIs let this drag on the longer a settlement is likely

&#x200B;

**RETAIL INVESTOR WINNING - WHAT TO EXPECT**

Now that we understand that what will winning look like?  Well we have two outcomes:

&#x200B;

1.	Successful Buy Wall Overwhelms The Shorts

* This could literally happen tomorrow with enough power
* The price will gamma squeeze, then squeeze, and then game is over
* Watch for massive market dips

&#x200B;

2) Retail Investors Own All The Shares

* While unlikely there could be a situation where everyone is HOLDING and shorts can't get their shares
* A ladder attack will lower the price to get retail investors to sell  - imagine a slow steady drop to $20/share
* After waiting it out a month or two eventually the HFs fold and a real buy and a real ask will go through at whatever the retail investors deem the share price to be (again hopefully VERY HIGH)
* EDIT: THIS IS VERY UNLIKELY AND JUST THEORY.  IT WOULD BE HISTORICAL TO SEE 100% OF ALL SHAREHOLDERS NOT PLACING AT LEAST ONE BUY AND ONE LIMIT SELL.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

* Hedge funds want to drag this out waiting for a settlement or retail investors to sell
* The retail investors best strategy is to BUY and HOLD.
* A successful retail investor strategy ***eliminates the idea that there is ""a dip"" to create a buying wall.***  There is only pre-squeeze and post-squeeze prices.
* A buying wall - supported by a swath of limited order buys - by the retail investor will move price up slowly day after day until this over
* One well-intentioned whale could end this tomorrow if they really cared
* Don't be surprised to see a settlement with government or another party come through if this drags on

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, this is for purely educational learning purposes.*

I have some serious questions about AMC. I am concerned about the fact that the floating shares just increased because AMC let Silver Lake dump $600 million worth of shares to remove their debt. The short volume was 42mil shorted shares to 52mil floated shares in Jan 15 (last date from Marketbeat) but now I believe it will be 42mil shorted to 96mil floated shares next week. Unless the shorts are dumb enough to short those shares instead of covering, we might have an issue with the ""inevitable"" short squeeze. Unfortunately AMC doesn't have the same ""guaranteed"" short squeeze as GME.

I am wondering what everyone else thinks about the situation?

My Position: 1050 shares at $4.30

Keep in my mind I got in before the Reddit hype and right after AMC announced that they have secured enough funding to be free from the dangers of bankruptcy. I figured that by summer time as moviegoers rush to the theaters, by Q2 earnings, AMC would be trading at $6-7. I never in my wild dreams though that it would be trading almost 3x my cost basis one week after I got in lol.

Be smart about your position and your profits. ü¶çü¶ç üí™üí™, GME üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ 

Alright retards, put on your helmet and take that crayon out of your nose because it's time to get serious. 

Diamond handing is important. It's been the most important part of our strategy, no doubt. The concept's easy, but this volatility is enough to age us all 40 years. Not everyone, especially the newer people, are capable of stomaching these drops, so I'd like to offer a more practical (more realistic maybe) guide to diamond handing. At the very least, this guide will help you be more confident in your positions and greatly decreasing your odds of being a little bitch that sells at the first sign of red. 

&#x200B;

**If you're just joining us now and bought any of the hyped stocks at current prices or higher:**  


1. **Educate yourself.** You bought a stock, which is ownership of a company. Understand the fundamentals behind what your company. DD is not something WSB is lacking in. You have a searchbar. You have eyes. (I mean, unless you don't. That's cool too. Have someone read you DD out loud like a bedtime story. :) ) I really like [this DD on Gamestop](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/) if you want to learn some more about Gamestop. I don't know (and don't care) about any of the other stocks, so you're on your own. **Educate yourself on the company you own a portion of and you'll be less prone to paper hand.** 
2. **Don't sell at a loss.** It's just retarded. Fear is one of the worst human emotions and you'll never make money in the market if you're scared of a little red. So if you can't stand that you're down 10% on a stock that swings 50% a day, why did you buy it in the first place? Similarly, if you're down 50% on a stock, it makes no sense to sell it when it pretty much can only go up from there. This isn't to say that stop loss isn't important but I feel like I'll do more harm by trying to explain to you retards on when to use it. So for now, while the hype is still there, just hold. 
3. **Only invest what you can afford to lose.** Don't overleverage. Don't use margin. Seriously, if you're struggling to put food on the table and your last $10 are in AMC like a retard, this game really isn't for you. The reason is that you're so scared for your money that you will make the worst possible decisions at the worst time and lose that money. Don't underestimate fear and desperation. This isn't just a get rich quick scheme. 
4. **When you're up bigly, congratulations!** You win. Follow the advice for OGs. 

&#x200B;

**If you're an OG and bought Gamestop when it was double digits:**  


1. **Congratulations you big chad! :)**
2. **Consider taking a little bit of profit.** If you bought Gamestop at like $12, you are up bigly, no doubt, but it can be extremely nerve wrecking to watch your portfolio erase three years of your Wendy's salary in an hour and so you can be prone to paper handing. It will really be much easier if you sell a tiny portion of your shares to at least cover the initial deposit. That way, if Gamestop goes down to $0 (when hell freezes over, but you never know), you at least break even. It'll be easier to sleep at night. I mean, even Deepfuckingvalue does it. Be smart about it. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, it's hard to diamond hand consistently if you have trouble sleeping at night due to how overleveraged you are. It's like a diet fad. The chad that limits himself by 100 calories but sticks to it consistently will do better than the retard trying to fast 72 hours when he's never gone 30 minutes without a sugar donut. 

Be realistic and take care of yourself. It's far easier to stay consistent by doing that. 

If anybody has any questions on Gamestop, stocks, or options, feel free to ask in the comments. My DMs are open too if you're shy üò≥ üëâüëà.

Positions: A fuckton of GME, bought both at $14 and at $300. I buy every dip and hold, I've sold my entire portfolio to feed my GME gambling addiction but I've also sold 8% of my shares to cover my initial investment so it truly doesn't matter anymore if it goes tits up.

But WHY do we know that‚Äôs bullshit? 

Well, if you‚Äôre new to investing there‚Äôs a concept called margin. Margin is essentially a line of credit given by brokerages to users to trade with. They still ‚Äúown‚Äù whatever you buy with it, but you‚Äôre allowed to take profits on how you use it, paying them back with interest once you‚Äôve made gains. If you‚Äôre not making gains, they‚Äôll sell your stuff for you and you‚Äôll be responsible for making up the loss.

A while back, people in financial circles were freaking out because of the ‚Äúinflux of you inexperienced investors trading on margin‚Äù, thinking it could cause a crash from reckless investing. Of course that‚Äôs not true, because the retail investor is on the hook for these losses. What might bring down the market is institutional investors utilizing some of the strategies that they said uninformed retail investors would do. It‚Äôs hypocrisy incarnate. You‚Äôre on the hook for your margin losses, or any cash losses. They‚Äôre trying to get hedge funds OFF the hook for theirs.

Here‚Äôs the thing though. Almost ANYONE could get an ABSOLUTE SHITLOAD OF MARGIN.

Unemployed college students and $40k/year average people were given thousands, often tens of thousands, dollars of credit to trade with. These are essentially loans that they know very few people will actually benefit from. Loans your bank would never give you. RH didn‚Äôt give a shit, because they don‚Äôt give a shit about your risk.

Once people realized buying GME with their own cash was a sure fire way to make money, they started ‚Äúcaring about your risk‚Äù. They‚Äôre not limiting your risk. They‚Äôre limiting your GAINS that you‚Äôd earn at the expense of hedge funds that pay them for your trading data. 

‚ÄúRisk with a high likelihood of downside? Have at it. Risk with almost surefire insanely high upside? We‚Äôre gonna have to step in. ‚Äú

Edit to add: yes, there‚Äôs also the (probably more impactful) reality that they likely didn‚Äôt have the capital they needed to facilitate these trades. My main point is that it‚Äôs SURE AS HELL not to minimize YOUR risk."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185640.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['WHY', 'A', 'OFF', 'NYONE', 'OLUTE', 'TLOAD', 'OF', 'ARGIN', 'RH', 'GME', 'GAINS', 'SURE', 'AS', 'HELL', 'YOUR']|['GME']

This DD needs a lot more attention. 

Ima keep this simple. The following DD posted by u/fyzle deserves more attention than it's been getting. It's simple, clear and common sense. 

Basically, about 30% of GME shares are owned by just 3 investment firms (Blackrock, Fidelity, Vanguard). Another 30% is own by other investment firms and Ryan Cohen, which brings it to over 60%... all of who have a vested interest in seeing GME moon.

If you think for one second that Blackrock, the world's largest investment fund, is going to let GME fail then you must be literally retarded. 

They do not lose money. Period. 

Citadel, Melvin and Citron are nothing compared to the might of just Blackrock alone. Throw in Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab, Susquehana Capital and a bunch of others (see link), and you quickly realize that shorts don't have a leg to stand on.

Read further for more details on this retarded theory.

**Disclaimer**: I‚Äôm retarded and have been wrong in the past. This is fan fiction and fairy tales **not financial or investment advice**.

So during the last 2 weeks our wonderful subreddit blew up and is now pretty much known by every person on the fucking planet. I've looked at what is happening overall in the market vs what is happening in the high short % stocks during that time. I've selected a 2 week timeline because I believe during this time everyone on the market (including hedge funds) have discovered what's moving these stocks.

Here's the figures since January 19th (18th markets were closed). I've included the most popular high short % stocks since they're what retail investors (we) seem to be buying with our mouths foaming. I apologize if I left out your favourite meme stock, fuck you, keep reading it's about to get more interesting.

**Timeline: January 19th - January 29th**

High short interest stocks:

GME +680%
AMC +330%
LGND +47% 
SPWR +46%
SPCE +40%
BBBY +35%
FUBO +30%

Even half blind smooth brains can see they are all mooning. But why are GME and AMC outperforming the rest? We'll come back to them later. Next up is looking at the performance of other shit on the market. I've tried to select large cap stocks and indices that are relevant to the situation, you retards can go and look up the rest and **prove me wrong.**

**Timeline: January 19th - January 29th** 

Selected stocks & indices:

S&P 500 -2,2%
NASDAQ -0,5%
AAPL +3,2%
MSFT +8,5%
FB +0,5%
TSLA -5,2%
GOOGL +2,4%

What's interesting about this you say? Everything seems  normal, they're mostly flat, who the fuck cares right? You would be right, during the 2 week timeline things look pretty normal.

Now let's look what has happened since **shit hit the fan** on Thursday (28th) after Robinhood started to limit the buys on meme stocks and **EVERYONE** started to talk about wsb and retail investors hunting stocks with high short %.

**Timeline: January 28th - January 29th**

Selected stocks & indices:

S&P 500 -1,14%
NASDAQ -2%
AAPL -5,3%
MSFT -1,8%
FB -7,3%
TSLA -2,5%
GOOGL -0,5%

Everything is red. Why is that weird? For one FB, MSFT, AAPL actually **all beat earnings** released last week (TSLA missed). Why are investors not piling onto these stocks? There's multiple reasons and here's where the **nuclear bomb theory** comes into picture. I suggest you put on your cloak and wizard hat it's about to get retarded.

I believe the smart money realized what's about to happen and are exiting their long positions. By smart money I'm referring to hedge funds like Melvin Capital who are losing $3B a month. Even you degenerates here have exited your other positions and YOLO'd into GME and AMC. As many people here with IQ above 80 have earlier stated a lot of these hedge funds are piled onto the same long and short positions. The biggest short positions they're in are most likely all in the red because the short squeeze frenzy happening. They're scared shitless over the idea they might be caught in a situation like Melvin where they need to be bailed out by buddies or even worse, go tits up. Some of them saw this earlier and probably were smart enough to cover and close their shorts. Some of them have not covered or even worse may have doubled down on shorts. Since last Thursday these clowns have a planet full of üíé‚úä retards bidding up their short positions.

I believe to avoid blowing up their chad funds, on Thursday and Friday they started to liquidate their long positions to be able to cover the short positions. What happens when a bunch of these suits start exiting at the same time? It tanks the stock (which I believe is happening to AAPL, MSFT, FB and many others, possibly the whole market). This leads to a cycle where even more funds want to liquidate long positions because suddenly they're losing money on the shorts (mooning) and longs (tanking). Remember these people are leveraged **TO THE TITS** so in an event where they're losing on all fronts they may be forced to liquidate positions to avoid margin calls.

Moving capital from their longs to cover their short positions will make things **even worse** for the not so smart funds that have not yet covered. High short % stocks will moon even harder due to other funds covering and the boomer long positions they are in will drill down even more. 

In this situation GME and AMC are **Little Boy** and **Fat Man** (read your history kids). They are the first and the second **Nuclear Bomb** to drop. They will suck all the surrounding capital into a mushroom cloud ascending into the stratosphere. Why are GME and AMC blowing up especially bigly? Because they do shit even your 90 year old grandma can understand. Depending how the situation evolves, other high short % stocks may or may not join them in their ride to the heavens (my opinion is they will be duds). I'm seeing a lot of turmoil in the upcoming weeks, look at what happened to VIX last week.

Tried it with three different bank accounts. No dice. It either gave me a ""server error"" message, or it told me that a bank had to be verified.

At this point I'm getting bad vibes, try to post my screenshot (still pending with the mods), and leave it for a minute. Come back later on my PC and try again. No dice. Then, I think, well, let's try it with $100 instead of $600.

And it lets me withdraw.

OK, we'll try a bigger number.

Nope.

Now I'm sus, so I fire up OBS studio and screen record all of this shit as I go through and attempt to get it to let me withdraw any amount larger than $100. Nothing larger than $100 can withdraw, but $100 (and presumably lower) can. I kept going right up until I run out of daily withdrawals.

It looks to me very much like **Robinhood is limiting withdrawals to $100 or less and pretending it's a server error.**

This can't possibly be legal, and I don't know how it could be a server error. I'm not as strong on comp sci as I used to be, but 100 is a fucking int and 600 is a fucking int and they're both three digits and should require the exact same amount of computational power to transact/calculate/whatever.

Again, I have screenshots from my phone, and I took a screen recording as I went through and did this on my PC. Can anyone advise whether it is 1) possible that it is indeed a server error, or 2) if not, how it could possibly be legal? Cause like I said it still fucking looks to me like they're just not allowing us to get our money out.

There needs to be a fair market, if for whatever reason a certain market cannot remain fair, it is halted until it resumes being fair.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The DTCC can only raise cash obligations during, 1) extended hours trading after the regular session has ended or no later than one hour before the regular session begins, or 2)  when the market is closed.
2. No financial instrument can trade only one way. Either you can buy and sell at every brokerage, or neither and it is halted.
3. As a consequence of 2, only the exchanges can limit trading via a halt. There are many different halts that can be used. The three main halts that I think may be the most applicable are T12, H11, and O1 (Note: These are all NASDAQ halts, I cant find a good NYSE list of halts)
   1. T12 - **Additional Information Requested by NASDAQ** 
   2. H11 -  **Regulatory Concern**

4. When the DTCC decides to raise cash obligations, if a clearing house cannot meet its new cash obligation in time of market open, it is deemed as a major risk and the DTCC will tell the exchanges to halt trading for that security until all clearing houses can meet the new cash obligation.
5. If a clearing house is unable to meet the obligation, the brokerages using that clearing house have the right to supplement clearing for that asset through a different clearing house. This will allow trading to resume even if a clearing house cannot meet it's cash obligations for that asset.
6. The DTCC needs to have a significant cash reserve on hand ready to lend to clearing houses that cannot meet the obligation requirements. This will decrease the likely hood that trading gets halted.
7. The DTCC is only allowed to loan its cash reserves at or below the Risk-Free Interest Rate.
8. Any brokerage and clearing house that allows a short sale to occur once the Short Interest reaches 100% of Float shall receive a monetary fine equal to 2x the market value of that trade.
9. No single trading body, institutional or retail,  can be short more that 5% of Float for more than 48 hours past the start of the next regular session.
10. Failure to comply with rule 8 results in a monetary fine for the trader/institution equal to the market value of the size of the short position which is above the 5% limit."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185643.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['DTCC', 'I', 'ASDAQ', 'I', 'NYSE', 'DTCC', 'DTCC', 'DTCC', 'DTCC']|[]

This is not a bear postüö´üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêª, just a bull trying to protect himself and maybe others from the suits & feds. 

A few thoughts to consider:

1. *A new major catalyst is probably necessary to trigger a MOASS due to the consequences of point #2*. *Early exercising of deep ITM calls may serve as a major component of that catalyst.* 
2. GME may trade up slowly (short-burn) as shorts bleed and begin to unwind over-time. This now possible because of actions taken by RH and other brokerage against retail investors, to slow upward momentum by halting the buy-side of the trade, thus allowing shorts to reconvene, degross, and reposition.  
3. If GME hits >$1000 we could potentially see some unprecedented FED/SEC intervention in the form of a ""retail-investor friendly"" bailout. I'm not familiar with the legalities and details of how this could actually play out. That being said, if the FED/SEC are concerned about a major market sell-off due to the MOASS, I expected them to strike a fixed-equity deal where all shorted shares must be covered for a fixed value. In this scenario, those with shares will profit bigly; those with calls may be left holding their bag.

I plan to exercise my deep ITM calls on Monday, just to be safe. They have no extrinsic value. Obviously, this only works for those who have the $ to exercise. 

Thoughts?

Fuck Robbing hood. DIAMOND HANDS AT $316.30 BABY -  [https://i.imgur.com/7Sf4ZXQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/7Sf4ZXQ.png)

Here is a video from Louis Rossmann explaining it - [https://youtu.be/MAqxQe0l4g0](https://youtu.be/MAqxQe0l4g0)

&#x200B;

This is for all of those who don't understand why Robin Hood, Trading 212 and all the other brokers restricted buying of $GME and $AMC.

The levels to a share purchase of a share are as follows - Broker/hedgefund  > Clearing house > DTCC

# Broker:

Robinhood, T212 etc. They are simply a platform to allow people to buy and sell shares on an app.

Hedge funds are also at this level but obviously don't need a broker like retail investors do.

&#x200B;

# Clearing House:

They provide the DTCC with collateral (usually 1 to 3%) for 2 days which can be called upon in case the broker/hedge fund cannot pay DTCC to settle the trade.

Trades are settled 2 days after the transaction takes place at DTCC level.

If the broker cannot pay up to legally settle the trades 2 days later, the clearing house is on the hook and has to pay up to DTCC.

Because of the volatility and risk of market wide collapse with trades not being able to be cleared with cash, DTCC required that clearing houses put up 100% collateral. This removes risk that the seller of a stock might not get paid cash.

&#x200B;

# DTCC:

They are the guys who replace the old paper exchange of share ownership.

They handle like 95% of all share exchanges and are responsible to ensure the market does not collapse.

Collapse in this case is if a seller does not get paid when they sell a share. This would happen for every stock on the market due to clearing houses not having the money to pay up.

# 

# Now why could you sell but not buy?

Surely the brokers are manipulating the stock to drive the price down?

This is because when you buy a stock, all of the above has already taken place. DTCC is happy that the money is in place in case the stock is sold.

Then when you sell GME, you get paid because the clearing house has already guaranteed the funds to DTCC.

They stopped buying so that the risk of sale default is minimised.

In my opinion, the brokers fucked up. Even though they CAN allow selling of the stock, they must have known that it would drive down the price of the stock by ONLY allowing selling. They should have blocked selling as well as buying until the clearing houses found the funds.

# So what did Robinhood do wrong?

Essentially Robinhood fucked up by allowing so much margin and borrowed funds to retail investors. They ran out of money to front to the clearing house. This is why they limited buys and asked for margin buyers to have 100% cash in the account.

# What about the hedge funds?

Melvin Capital fucked up with the short. They didn't have enough money to cover their positions and buy the high price cover. Citadel therefore bailed them out.

# Why could I buy $GME the next day?

Clearing houses went to banks to get lending for large sums of money so they can provide DTCC with the necessary collateral that they require, this is why the brokers could allow the retail investors to buy the stock again.

# Why did some brokers allow us to buy $GME when others didn't?

Different brokers use different clearing houses. So while one clearing house locked off a broker, the other clearing house may have been fine and not done the calculations yet.

That's why there was kind of a juggling situation between brokers allowing buys and restricting buys.

On Friday T212 did not restrict buys for cash on GME, but they completely restricted CFD on it. This is because they couldn't front the leverage themselves or through their clearing house

# TLDR:

I know we degens don't want to believe it, but the brokers did not have a choice in this.

The clearing houses told the brokers to stop the buying because they didn't have the money to guarantee that you get paid if you sell.

Restricting buying and ONLY allowing selling DID result in a manipulation of the stock price but that wasn't the main reason behind the Clearing Houses forcing the brokers to stop the buying.

In my opinion, the brokers fucked up. Even though they CAN allow selling of the stock, they must have known that it would drive down the price of the stock by ONLY allowing selling. They should have blocked selling as well as buying until the clearing houses found the funds."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185646.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['AMOND', 'HANDS', 'AT', 'BABY', 'ZXQ', 'ZXQ', '$GME', '$AMC', 'DTCC', 'DTCC', 'DTCC', 'DTCC', 'DTCC', 'DTCC', 'DTCC', 'GME', 'DTCC', 'CAN', 'ONLY', 'I', '$GME', 'DTCC', '$GME', 'GME', 'CFD', 'I', 'ONLY', 'DID', 'CAN', 'ONLY']|['GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

TL;DR: The hedge funds and the lawmakers could find a way to get around the law and screw us. They always have and they always will. They have much more means that we do, and only from a probabilistic point of view, we will lose. Can we imagine a scenario where this could happen ?

&#x200B;

I know that what I about to say sounds bearish. I own my part of GME shares since before the first gamma squeeze and I have now pretty nice gains (as many of us do). I agree on the possibility for the price to reach astronomical limits due to the short squeeze. In theory, it could work.

In theory.

You think that because this is the weekend, everything stopped and will resume on Monday like nothing happened ? No. Right now, the hedge funds executives and all their management boards are certainly working on a solution to make legal what happened last week . They are right now trying to find a way to take your shares from you. And for this, they will have the help of many people, people which can be at a very high level of our society. And after this will happen, we will be the one accused of having manipulated the market. And you all know they have near unlimited means to do so. They have the money, they have politics, they have the hardware power. They have everything. You got a taste of it last week with that huge bots attack on Reddit and how they managed to manipulate the market so far.

We have the shares. And we got them legally, in all transparency, with our own and hardly earned money and we have the absolute right to buy some more at the price we want, and to sell them at the price we want.

Sure, the shares, that‚Äôs what they want. But what if they find the ‚Äúlegal‚Äù way to take it from you ? And worst than that: to take them from you without giving you back at least your initial investment ?

This sounds extreme. But this is what happened in 2008. They took your money and your houses, without giving you anything back. The hedge funds were protected by politics. To big to fail they said‚Ä¶

Well, this week they failed for a second time. What will they do now ? Sorry to say this, but most probably the same thing.

So, do you guys have an idea how they could manage to skirt the law or bypass it ? I do not live in the US, so I do not know how they could do this. If someone has an idea, please share it below.

&#x200B;

I felt I had to write this because since last week and especially since last Friday, the number of people reading reddit and especially WSB increased more than exponentially. Many people want to join this financial fight. Many of them are young (I hope more than 18 at least). Many of them are maybe putting themselves in danger.

So I just wanted to suggest you to think twice before investing all your life savings for this noble cause: will you be in financial danger if they manage to take all your investment from you ? How would you live with this ? Would you still  be able to pay your bills, taxes, and bring food on the table ? Just take a moment to think about this. There is a hight probabillity to lose it all on this.

Personally, I have a broad portfolio. If this happens, I would certainly lose a certain percentage of it. It will take some time to build it again sure‚Ä¶ But I will not be in immediate danger (so does Melvin & Co if they lose some more billions by trying to take the price down in vainüòä; In theory they will continue this practice until they really start to feel what it looks like to be in danger ; maybe for the first time of their lives ?

This is why I will hold my shares: because I bought them legally and I have the right to sell them at whatever the fucking price I want. I will hold. Because it is legally mine‚Ä¶ and also, I just like the stock, it is doing great for me recently...

I just felt I had to write this to show to all lurkers, media, and all, that WSB is not only a forum where we YOLO our savings unconsciously. We are also people who know how to manage our risks and who care about each other.

Now you may have diamond hands üíéüôå but do you have a diamond brain üíé[üß†](https://emojipedia.org/brain/)?

Sounds like a simple answer, right? Yes. Well...

Diamond hands are about holding the nerve when the red starts getting darker. Imagine being in a rocket violently shaking as it leaves earth‚Äôs orbit. The shaking is so violent you have ground control telling you to abort. But you don‚Äôt.

Now imagine being in school or work and rumours are being spread about you. No one likes you, they start to distance themselves, then they start to vilify and attack you too. They push you around, treat you like shit and no matter how many people you tell they don‚Äôt believe you.

That‚Äôs what you need to prepare for. Those rumours will be heard by your friends than your family, who believe them. But you hold your fucking nerve.

Last weak was them turning the oven on and getting the pan warmed up. This coming weak they will call everything under the sun. The hedgie-bitches may work with their buddies to start making people 401K‚Äôs and other funds shrink to nothing and there say it‚Äôs your fault. You‚Äôre the reason that America is getting bankrupted.

The US Gov may even get involved. Think you‚Äôve seen or had enough of the last 4-5 years of politics? You haven‚Äôt seen shit. You‚Äôre now messing with Wall Street who have politicians on speed dial. These politicians only got into politics thanks to the help of Wall Street. Your Vote < Wall Street Money

Making sense?

We may have some on our side now but they will get pushed aside and told this isn‚Äôt their fight.

I‚Äôm going to end it there as I think you get the message.

I really hope we don‚Äôt get this far and they try to pull these tactics on us be who knows what sinister tactics they have hiding up their sleeves.

I've held AMD since November 2015 (@$1.94) and have weathered these speculative downturns many times. IMO the latest downturn is driven purely by an anticipated return to greatness due to Gelsinger's return. This confidence in Gelsinger is greatly misplaced for two reasons:

1. Gelsinger may be better than Intels past 3 dipshit ceos, but he's no Andy Grove. Gelsinger's retarded baby was Itanium, which AMD handily beat with x86_64.

2. Even if Intel burried Andy Fucking Grove in a Pet Semetary it would take years for him to turn that steaming turd of a company around.

This whole situation is so outlandish, farfetched, beyond imagination; something just doesn't smell right, or feel right, at least in my pp.

And so, I came, after looking at DFVs current positions again; but after that, I came up with a question - How do big firms like Melvin short over 100% and expect nobody to notice?

Or maybe... perhaps they did expect people to notice. What if Melvin and co. is actually IN on the play?

What if they saw the short interest was very high, close to or above 100% - and came up with the plan to add short positions to increase the short interest to levels that will be picked up and acted on by other firms/retail investors - and trigger a short squeeze... BUT preemptively get out of their short positions, and before they have to report their long positions etc...

Because their newer, unreported positions will be all on the LONG side.

The 'bailout' may have been necessary to increase their long positions further, or perhaps they were caught in the squeeze much faster than they had initially thought.

It could be the biggest bait and switch in (recent) financial history.

The gain porn would be unimaginable.

In the fractionally tiny chance that I'm right, I've posted this to my research related twitter account @LimeResearch - no affiliation to shitron; just in case I'm right, I want to have the proof timestamped in two places (for my movie/book deals of course).

I remember a year ago this sub was nothing but memes of J-Powell littered with rocketship emojis. Now It's GME posts littered rocketship emojis. We've come so far. 

Now listen:

If you think Wall Street is shitting their pants over the GME short squeeze you are 100% right. Jim Bianco lays out a [convincing case](https://www.financialsense.com/podcast/19847/jim-bianco-gamestop-and-great-short-seller-takedown#.YBTK3GAFZmU.twitter) that SPY was down 2% on Friday because hedge funds were dropping their ""safe"" stocks to raise capital for collateral against their rising margin debt on GME. 

But you also got to know this. At the same moment Robinhood halted purchases of GME, after calls from their hedge fund buddies, they also put on limits on $SLV. 

([Here is the list of all limited stocks](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) \- they've since added weird stuff like Starbucks, but $SLV was one of the first along with $GME and $AMC). I think that's pretty weird, considering that, unlike these other stocks, $SLV was up only a few percent on Thursday. It's even weirder when you consider that Robinhood had just been [bailed out by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult?sref=rY0z5sRB)! These fuckers are two of the worst silver manipulators out there. (Seriously. Link for [Goldman](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bank-nova-divestiture-goldman-sachs-idUSKBN1DS2C5). Link for [JPM](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html))

These banks have been raking it in on suppressing the price of silver for  decades. Look at this historical chart of silver. Does this make any sense? Silver was well over $30 for several years in the ***fucking 1980s.*** And now it's $27???

The fair price of silver, conservatively is CERTAINLY over $50, but it seems that there were some strings attached to JPM and GS's little loan to Robinhood. 

I'm balls deep in GME, but am riding this silver train too. Already last week $AG and $SLV were surging despite Robinhood's best efforts. If this thing breaks, both of those tickers will at least double. My personal price target for Silver is $70. The tendies from silver will be extra sweet for me  - nothing like breaking up the greatest cartel in modern history (apologies to OPEC). 

Keep fighting the good fight apes. We'll bring these bastards to their knees. 

My positions: $GME shares, $AG and $SLV shares and July calls.

So the answer is to buy tons of AMC, NOK or BB instead because shares are affordable right now.

Does it divide from üñêüñêüñê ? No because they don't have the funds for 10 shares of GME in the first place.

However, they do have funds for 10 shares of AMC or whatever the NEXT meme-stock is.

IF 300,000 people were each to buy 300 oz of physical silver ($8,400) = 90 million oz.

90 million oz = 2,812 metric tons.

According to Yahoo Finance GameStop is scheduled to report between 24-29 of **March.**

**Why wait until then?**

easy, usually short squeeze happens when there is a catalyst like acquisition, a new product announcement, or a surprise earning report. GME probably not going to buy or get bought out by someone and they won't announce a new product, but they will announce earnings 2 months from now that has a great chance to surprise EVERYONE.

**What do we know so far about their upcoming earnings?**

We only have information about their holiday sales:

* 4.8% increase in comparable stores sales YOY and 29.6% growth QOQ
* 309% increase in E-Commerce sales, representing 34% of total sales reaching $1.35B.
* Total sales declined 3.1% driven by an 11% decrease in the company store base.
* Australia and New Zealand sales increase 31%

Basically, GameStop closed 11% of the company stores, and still, total sales were down a minor 3.1% while comparable sales increased 4.8%. This means 2 things:

1. Physical stores are still profitable or performing very well.
2. E-Commerce Sales are now making up for the loss of sales of closed stores, leading the way for e-commerce being the main company revenue stream.
3. Covid free countries like Australia and New Zealand are still buying from GameStop helping it penetrate these huge markets.

GME on the 3Q report said that they expect positive comparable sales (which we just saw are probably going to be positive) and finally being profitable.

The key here is PROFITABILITY. GME was profitable only 3 times in the last 12Q ([https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/net-income](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/net-income)).

In the last 2Q that GME achieved profitability the stock went up.

27.3.20 was the day of announcement:

[https://ibb.co/ZJCG9hJ](https://ibb.co/ZJCG9hJ)

The stock gapped up a whopping **16%** before going down.

11.6.19 was another profitable Q announcement:

[https://ibb.co/8Pkx53L](https://ibb.co/8Pkx53L)

The stock gapped up 8.5% after earnings.

**Why is it matter?**

well if the next earning report will be a good surprise we will see the price move up the next day and if the company will show a clear path of profitability for the next years **THE SHORT THESIS WILL BE GONE AND A SHORT SQUEEZE WILL FOLLOW**üöÄüöÄüöÄ

The odds of profitability are very high with the management expecting it and E-Commerce sales booming. I conclusion HOLD TILL EARNINGS DONT SALE!!!!!!!!

**TL;DR:** The squeeze will happen when there will be a catalyst, the only catalyst for GME is earnings at the end of March, so hold tight until then and let's get the moneyyyyyüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

*This is not financial advice, do you own DD.*

Positions: 141 stocks at 14$ average price üöÄüöÄ

Edit: IMHO these earnings are not regular earnings, they are going to talk about profitability and hopefully give guidance to after covid because of the vaccines that give hope for the retailers.

If one ü¶ç lends one üçå to a üêç who then sells it to another ü¶ç that means there is one shorted üçå.

Now if second üêç borrows that same üçå from the second ü¶ç and sells it to a third ü¶ç...well guess what??  That same üçå has been shorted twice. This is how you can have that single üçå turn into two üçåüçå on the short side

He says GME is a once in a lifetime squeeze that we will likely never see again. And he is right. When shares get called back all hell will break loose.

All other tickers are acting to split our community‚Äôs buying power. I get it, we can like many stocks, but we need to REALLY LIKE GME until the end of next week. 

We have them by the balls on GME and every other fake squeeze going on in the market is here to serve as a distraction.

I believe mods should hold a forum referendum on the topic of banning anything not GME related for the next week. Too many $AMC $BB $NOK shills are detracting from the cause, many of them are new to our sub. ONLY GME can bring Wall Street to their knees.

Why should we listen?**

Truth be told, you probably shouldn‚Äôt. I am a contrarian style investor, and I missed the contrarian signal in March, and entered the uptrend again way too late. If you read my post history, you will see a lot of bad calls and terrible advice (with hindsight, that is). That is why this is not investment advice in any shape or form. I am just as retarded as the next guy. I think, however, I might contribute some things that might not be common knowledge on WSB, and I really miss the good old DD posts amid the whole wsb-goes-vigilante-activist-investor vibe.

**Okay, I am retarded and can barely read. Give me some bullet points before I zone out?**

My main points:

 1.	The main narrative is way too one sided, and everyone‚Äôs a bull.

 a.	Remember when everyone was a bear back in March? Yeah, contrarian indicators are a thing. I missed it then and lost most of my gains from the ride down trying to call a top for the ‚Äúbulltrap‚Äù.

 b.	USD shorts and treasury shorts are insanely large (historic record highs a couple of weeks ago), betting on a huge inflation spike any time now‚Ä¶

 c.	Market euphoria and bullishness is also insanely high ‚Äì all the bears have gone into hibernation.

 2.	Everyone believes ‚Äúmoney printing‚Äù and ‚Äústimulus‚Äù creates growth and inflation, even though there is no proof of this happening in Japan, Europe, the US or anywhere else for the last 13 years.


 3.	Magic crayons and market fundamentals agree that this rally has gotten way ahead of itself.

 a.	There is a massive RSI divergence between the top back in Feb 2020 and the 2021 top.

  b.	Valuations are pricing in perfection for nearly every company for the foreseeable future.

**Okay, genius. I‚Äôve heard it all before. Jay Powell has our back, bulls have nothing to fear.**

Does he, really? The Wall Street narrative is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fight the Fed‚Äù, and it has become a self-fulfilling prophecy ever since the (in)famous ‚ÄúGreenspan put‚Äù. How many of you actually paid attention back in Feb-March? Jpow didn‚Äôt just fire one bazooka and made everything fine. He needed multiple tries, and for a while there, the market did NOT care one bit what he did to rates or what insane number he pulled out of his ass for Super-QE. When the bears had exhausted themselves and passive flows started saving the day, the narrative changed into ‚ÄúFed saves the day, once again‚Äù, and there was much rejoicing.

**But QE is creating a wave of liquidity, ‚Äúsloshing around‚Äù, propping up stocks! The financial media told me so!**

As many of the less retarded members of this subreddit may have noticed by now, the financial media is not your friend, and they have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about most of the time. It‚Äôs all talking points they get from their favorite Wall Street or Fed sources. 

What if I told you the whole ‚Äúmoney printing‚Äù thing was just a lie? Because it is, and demonstrably so. Sure, the Federal Reserve prints money. They print physical money. The US currently has about 1.5 trillion, or roughly 7% or the M2 Money stock (M2 is what the Fed tries to tell you is the actual amount of US dollars in circulation).

So, what is QE, if it‚Äôs not money printing? QE is the central bank buying treasuries and other liquid assets from primary dealers. Do they pay for these with money? No. They credit the value in bank reserves, so the bank may lend against the value (which they already could when they held treasuries). So the entire world want US treasuries, one of the most liquid assets in the world, and one of the most popular assets for repo collateral. The primary dealers sell these assets to the central banks to secure their balance sheets and make room for‚Ä¶ More treasuries. What happens to the bank reserves? They stay in the central bank, and can be used as a basis for lending.

So ‚Äì the banks can lend a lot more then ‚Äì that means they lend money to hedge funds and other investors, and the money is put into markets! The Fed saved us after all! QE really works!! Well, [this graph](https://imgur.com/mvy8m8A) doesn‚Äôt really fit that narrative. The massive spike in 2020 is companies maxing out their revolving loans to brace for impact. Like in 2008, lending has been negative every month since the height of the crisis.

Okay, so what if the Fed isn‚Äôt really printing money. The government is clearly conjuring up money out of thin air and airdropping them to the people!

Well, they certainly are increasing their debt and spending the money on ‚Äústimulus‚Äù. I think the word is fairly misleading though. Are you ‚Äústimulating spending‚Äù if you give a homeless guy $10? Because that, for me, is the equivalent of what the government is doing. They are trying to prevent a disaster, not trying to ‚Äústimulate‚Äù growth. The gap between where we would have been without covid19 and where we actually is, is a lot bigger than a measly couple of trillion.
 
Some perspective on the ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù so far: https://imgur.com/OkJyOUi 

What the government is doing is trying to help people be a bit less miserable, not going out and boosting GDP to new heights. It sure doesn‚Äôt seem like the money they are giving out is actually increasing consumer spending in either case: https://imgur.com/FsE9Tsv

**But, but‚Ä¶ Vaccines! Pent-up demand! Reflation! Dollar to zero!**

Vaccines are coming, and thank God for that. Is that really going to make the American economy explode (in a good way) though? It surely doesn‚Äôt seem like it outside the stock market. Last summer everyone were talking about how amazing Q4 would be. In Q4 everyone were talking about how amazing 2021 would be. Now people are starting to realize that 2021 probably won‚Äôt be so amazing after all, at least not until Q3-Q4. By the end of the summer, people will be talking about 2022. Noticed how nobody‚Äôs talking about a V-shaped recovery anymore? A recovery would indicate that we got back to where we started, and even though we had ‚Äúinsane‚Äù numbers of a quarter, we are nowhere near where we started back in February (which was already quite anemic compared to pre-2008 growth):

https://imgur.com/OkJyOUi

https://imgur.com/ROZuu7d

Lastly, about that pent-up demand. I fail to see it. Leisure makes up roughly 6% of GDP. Sure, people will start eating out again, they will go to amusement parks, they will get haircuts and pedicures, but will you make up for what you didn‚Äôt spend on it last year? 4 haircuts a month? 5 trips to Disney World? Eating out 8 days a week? The money has already been spent on RVs, computers, consoles, home remodeling and kitchen appliances. If anything, people might be spending less on these things than they did before covid. Evidence also points to Americans becoming more frugal and saving more to weather the next storm. I think ‚Äúreopening‚Äù and vaccines will be a non-event.

**Okay, I got this far. Why now? Why can‚Äôt we get SPY 400? 500?**
 
Warning. Magic crayons ahead. Consider yourself warned.

This is the S&P back in 2018:

https://imgur.com/66Prpwa

Notice how the RSI falls while the price increases? This is called divergence. It is considered a fairly reliable signal that something is amiss. The market made a new low, but the RSI didn‚Äôt? Better sell your puts and consider buying calls. The market made a new high, but the RSI didn‚Äôt? Vice versa. Some of you might happen what came next, but here is a picture:
 
https://imgur.com/E0C005O

Okay, not conviced? I get it. Here is the S&P early last year:

https://imgur.com/vXuZaCQ

I probably don‚Äôt have to tell you what came next, but you can clearly see it on the final graph:

https://imgur.com/ASdHAtx

Notice anything else? Exactly. The market is soaring once again. The RSI? Not so much. Make of it what you will.
If you look closely at the last picture, you will see that the S&P over the last week has gone from sitting comfortably on top of the 21 day moving average, to falling through. On Friday, we closed below the 50 day moving average. That was my cue for loading up üåàüêª style. If we close above the 50d on Monday, I will cover and wait for another signal. I don‚Äôt have the time to cover passive flows now, that will have to wait ‚Äì what you need to know if you load up on short term puts, is to get rid of everything before Friday Feb 19. The last week of the month is not a good time to be a bear, because dumb money is buying every index."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185643.csv|StockTicker|['DD', 'I']|['DD']|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'WSB', 'I', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'USD', 'US', 'RSI', 'NOT', 'QE', 'QE', 'I', 'US', 'US', 'QE', 'QE', 'US', 'QE', 'I', 'GDP', 'A', 'I', 'GDP', 'I', 'I', 'SPY', 'P', 'RSI', 'RSI', 'RSI', 'O', 'I', 'P', 'CQ', 'I', 'RSI', 'P', 'I', 'I']|['DD', 'GDP', 'GDP']

Therefore, they employ strategies that will yield the best returns on a quarterly or yearly basis. 

Why is this bad?

Because while they can make money 99 quarters out of 100, during that that 1 quarter where they lose money they lose all of it. 

That means your investments may increase 10-20% a year or whatever boomer gains they promise you, and continue to do so for several years, but one black swan event will pretty much wipe you out. 

For example: 

1999 = everyone wiped the fuck out

2008 = everyone wiped the fuck out

2020 = everyone wiped the fuck out

The hedge fund managers are fine though, because they got paid fat bonuses every quarter while delivering those boomer gains while exposing you to more and more risks. 

And Wall Street? Wall Street gets bailed out. Every time. The people who gambled the economy away is rewarded whether they win or lose. 

What we ought to do is educate people on where to find the tools and resources that will help them make more money than investing in hedge funds. Persuade people to withdraw from hedge funds and become a retail investor. 

Also, when hedge funds do shitty things like trying to destroy a company which employs thousands of minimum wage employees during a fucking pandemic, we catch those hedge funds with their pants down (edit: by exposing them)

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre a liberal or a conservative, straight or gay, religious or atheistic, black or white, old or young, smooth brained or wrinkly brained... we have a common enemy and its name is Big Money.

RH was actually investigated and the SEC confirmed the company had been misinforming and misleading investors in inaccurately reflecting market prices in the app, costing individual investors millions of dollars (at least). [SEC Probe](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321)

It‚Äôs also been questioned whether these shares are actually even hitting the market, as noted by some well established professionals like Erik Townsend. The validity of this is beyond the scope of my knowledge. 

Assuming all this information is true, we can assume that Citadel or subsidiaries/partners (say, short sellers or other large clearinghouse partners) owned a large part if not all these shares, simply trading them back and forth in a room of their own, disconnected from the market itself, at prices that may not reflect the true price of the stock. As we continued to buy and hold, some sold for MASSIVE profits, Citadel, and the shorts began to lose on their positions, meanwhile Robinhood was making just cents on every trade, while paying out said MASSIVE profits. 

It was at this point the house of cards began to fall. The clearinghouse is forced to sell and buy in the actual open market as shares continued to be lost to the retail investors, in tandem with the SEC probe from earlier, it spoiled their scheme to scrape cash off the top of these trades. Without this scheme running, and with a mass portion of RH investors turning to only a handful of stocks, RH likely found themselves losing ENORMOUS amounts of cash. As stated by Vlad Simpnev himself they had to take out lines of credit to support this shitty system. 

Ultimately, RH found themselves in a position where if  they don‚Äôt do anything they will likely not be able cover the payouts to their investors bagging 10K-10M every other minute of the day. Moreover, in this instance their clearinghouse may well have lost ungodly amounts of cash or worse (bankruptcy), thus leaving RH without a clearinghouse as well. The alternative is what they chose, restrict all trading on this handful of stocks to try and reestablish order in their shitty system while also essentially bailing their clearinghouse out of billions in losses, thus ‚Äúsaving‚Äù the company.

Mods, can you please pin this for some time? If not then I would need everyone else's support to get this post noticed for its various subjects. Thanks 

1) A thank you to the mods for all their hard work with everything that has been going on. 

2) The amount of people that have joined this sub. Okay I know the first thing people will do is check me. I got massacred by PRPL gang (fuck those mattresses), MSFT 200c, I saw GUH the day it was posted, and even IronyMan when his balls touched the ground. So why the young account? Well, it's because of the suspensions, this is my third account and I like my current username even though most of the time it does go tits up for me. 

We went from 1.5M to 7M in the shortest period of time. This is ridiculous. Everywhere I am seeing those who make it pretty damn obvious that they just joined because they saw us on the news and don't know wtf is going on. It's annoying. Is there a way to filter out? Mods please let us know how we can help. I thought it was an excellent idea to make the sub private.

**WRONG**.

**THEY WANT YOUR AUTISM.**

These motherfuckers will be attempting to bottle up our autistic tendencies and use them as a nuclear weapon to enrich themselves. Weaponized autism has been harnessed since the beginning of WSB but this latest event is up there with the discovery of Nuclear Fission and the invention of Chicken tenders. Please do not underestimate how crafty these slimy cunts will be now that our true power has been revealed to the world.

Significant resources will be directed and unleashed here (if it isn't already), I'm talking Cambridge Analytica/Nation-State bot farm level attacks to influence and control narratives, they will run clever and subtle social media strategies. Everything will be camouflaged as grassroots to lure us in and bite the poison apple.

We cannot let this happen but I'm afraid I do not come with answers or solutions, we need to crowdfund our defenses. We must be vigilant after this historical event plays out and we must protect the sub at all costs. This is about to become a real-life game of Among us.

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. 

Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.

How much do hedge funds lose every day compared to how much would they lose by folding their hand?

&#x200B;

If you have looked into the short squeeze on VW in 2008, you would know that it was Porsche who onset this squeeze by announcing on SUNDAY, October 26, 2008, that they had acquired a \~ 74% interest in the company including \~ 31.5% in cash-settled options. 

&#x200B;

 Because Porsche was quietly building their position in VW, counterparties knew it would cause observable upward pressure on the stock price and decided they needed to hedge their written positions by buying the underlying stock. They also found that they could reduce their hedging costs by lending the underlying to short sellers. 

  
 At this point, there was only \~ 5.5% float due to Porsche's \~ 42.5% combined with 31.5% hedges by Porsche counterparties and \~21% protective stake held by the State of Lower Saxony. At the same time, short interest on the stock was around 13%. The short sellers were essentially in an infinite squeeze.

&#x200B;

The difference HERE is that Porsche held the cards. They offered to settle positions on \~5% of their positions to allow short sellers to meet their obligations. They made a KILLING - estimates are between $6bn - $12bn on much less short interest.

&#x200B;

This whole play was PORSCHE. PORSCHE decided when they wanted to take THEIR profits to benefit THEMSELVES. Fair Play. 

&#x200B;

BUT what is happening right now, THIS is potentially a MASS redistribution of wealth that has NEVER been SEEN BEFORE. REMEMBER THIS!!! This isn't one company making massive profits at the expense of Wall Street, this is THE PEOPLE, fighting back...and WINNING.

&#x200B;

NOBODY has to sell, but THEY have to BUY! Remember that. $1000 is not the end game, THEY will come again with their scare tactics but the line CAN be HELD, WE saw it FRIDAY.  ü§öüèºüíéü§öüèº... See you on the moon.

Friday AMC stock close: $13.26. Basically, the same price as a movie ticket.

Here's the data:

1. Stock float (Shares available to be traded): **106.60M**
2. Short float (percent of shorted shares): **41.91%**
3. Average trading volume (Shares traded in a day) including this week's activity: **84.62M**
4. Friday's trading volume (with buy restrictions in place): **594,653,177**
5. Short price **$2.15**

Now you have the data, here's the point...

Short ration is still well over 0.5! That means these bastards aren't giving up. They want to see the stock drop below $3.00, crush the company, and kill the largest employer of high school deadbeats in the country. Some short positions are moving out, but not many. Even with platforms buy restrictions in place the daily volume was 7x the average. 

Aside from the financials, people will be flooding movie theaters soon! People who haven't been to a theater in years will be piling in to see Top Gun 2, The Matrix 4, etc. **BECAUSE THEY CAN!** Movie theaters were taken away from all of us and people will be going back simply because there was a time they couldn't!

I'm not a financial expert. This is my personal opinion on what might happen with $GME in the next two weeks, based wholly on guesswork. *There's a very good chance there's something that I don't fully understand about the situation and thus I may be talking out of my ass here*.

A lot of people are expecting big moves in the coming weeks- possibly as early as Monday or Tuesday. It's definitely possible that we'll see some crazy stuff go down.

That said, I personally am considering a different possibility- that we'll see a repeat of Friday, where the price stays largely level and stable the whole time. Maybe a couple of smaller dips and peaks here or there, to make things seem realistic, but perhaps $GME might close out in the low to mid $300s all week.

Why might this happen? Well, clearly they realize by now that manipulating the market to artificially drive the price down does not induce panic sell-offs like they thought it would. The more they try to stomp the price down, the angrier and more ardent people get about holding that precious, precious stock.

So- and, again, this is where the speculation comes in- they might try keeping things nice and level. They might be at a point where they're realizing that buying back those shorts at $300 each is a lot better for them than $10,000. How to convince people to sell at $300, though? Just hold the market stable. People have short attention spans, and after a week of massive moves, seeing the price hover within a $20 range might bore a lot of people. Not only that, but the longer this goes on, the more the average person might be inclined to believe that $300 is the real price target for $GME after all.

It's just a thought. I could be totally wrong here.

**TL;DR**: MM and hedgies might manipulate the situation in the coming weeks to slow things down and make it seem like $300 is the real top for $GME, thus people could start selling not wanting to miss out on what they think is the ""peak"". They know forcing the price down doesn't work, so they could very well try to hold it steady instead. This is purely speculation and not advice, and I could be wrong about this whole thing."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185640.csv|StockTicker|['A', 'I']|[]|['$GME', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'I', '$GME', '$GME', 'I', 'MM', '$GME', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Yesterday I was in the airport of a city thousands of miles from my home. I saw a guy scrolling / laughing to himself and I thought‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYou know, this guy looks a little retarded - I wonder‚Ä¶‚Äù

I approached cautiously. Still from afar, like a true creep I spied on his screen - Even from a distance I could tell that he was, indeed on reddit. After a moment, he looked up. I simply said:

‚ÄúWSB?‚Äù
‚ÄúYEAH!‚Äù

It was 100% a little weird at first, but honestly, we felt a kind of kinship immediately - and although I have felt like part of something special over the last few weeks, actually meeting one of you dummies in real life hit different.

We talked a bit about our positions (ha), how we helped save a movie theater chain. History being written. Balance of power shift. What it all means. etc. etc. etc.

As much as we joke here at WSB, yesterday was a perspective shift for me. I usually think of you guys as a bunch of faceless (if entertaining) internet fairies with impeccable foul language.

But yesterday I boarded a plane bound for home with a new friend from thousands of miles away and it made me understand that there are 6 (wait, now 7 holy shit) MILLION living, breathing people with names, faces, and stories out there. We're all doing something important together.

It was really significant moment for me - and I‚Äôd be stoked if there was a way I could help more of us experience it.

I‚Äôm so proud to be one of you retards.

Community summer camps have scholarships and they will know which families can only send their kids for a week or two due to finances. 

Oncology center social workers know who's financially barely making it through treatment or someone who would be ecstatic over an unexpected Door Dash Friday night meal.


Every community has homes for women after incarceration or addiction, helping them learn how to hold jobs, manage their finances, etc, with the hope of reunifying families.

Most states have some sort of Grandparents Raising Grandchildren association. They know who is in their 60s and 70s raising children alone on Social Security and can use money for sports equipment or orthodontia or a night off from cooking.

Regional spinal injury centers will know who badly needs a new wheelchair or other adaptive equipment they cannot afford. 

Most communities have a foster/adoptive family group that tries to keep supplies for children suddenly removed from home. They often come with nothing and the foster families have a lot of immediate needs.

Just a point of interest: GameStop makes almost nothing from new game/console sales.

TLDR: You are **not** RobinHood's customers, *Citadel is*, you are the **product**. Since they make no commission from your trades, the majority of it comes from selling your trading data to the *sharks*. 

The CEO straight lied on television that they didn't have a liquidity problem as they raised more money the next day.

The reason they claimed users were only able to buy a limited amount of shares or trading was restricted was because of ""clearinghouse-mandated deposit requirements related to equities \[increasing\] ten-fold"". Basically, when you buy and sell shares, it goes through a clearinghouse, which connects the buyer and seller. The clearinghouse requires the broker to put down a certain deposit based on a number of factors, and robinhood is claiming they couldn't pay for the deposit, thus they had to restrict the buying of shares of certain stocks.

But when volatility increases, many brokers decided to a) not restrict trading or b) increase margin requirements. This seems like the logical choice, no? Instead of barring users from trading, or trading very little, instead, you can increase margin requirements to cover the cost of the deposit.

They also posted this a full day after locking down trading, and yet only selling was allowed? Firstly, if you're going to lock down trading, at least let the users know why immediately after you put the restriction in place. Second, if you can't cover the deposit, then why are you allowing selling? If you claim that you're locking down trading due to ""extreme volatility to protect customers"" then why are you only allowing selling?

Not only that, but you also forcibly sold customers positions on margin, and sold options before market close on the expiry date.

This whole situation seems very fabricated. Not very happy with robinhood, and I've already moved my money out a long time ago for other sketchy stuff robinhood does.

It was just something cool to do and I only used money I wouldn‚Äôt miss (which isn‚Äôt much since I don‚Äôt exactly make a whole lot). I‚Äôve been letting it sit ever since.

Over this last week or so, it‚Äôs been really surprising to see people actually rooting for us. We went from a store that had a loyal customer base to one that people want to shop at now that they 1) remember we exist or 2) just want to support the underdog. There have been so many times over the years I‚Äôve worked here where my faith in the company wavered, and that‚Äôs not surprising given some of the really bad calls made over time. People were getting tired of us and our old ways and the changes were too little too late. Until now.

I have people coming in to chat who didn‚Äôt even intend to buy anything but doing so anyway. People calling telling me to buy GME and hold (I already am). People who actually want us to succeed. After years and years of negativity I‚Äôm honestly starting to feel just a little of the love, and hopefully it grows from here.

1. That the curtain of how super-wealthy insiders and their only the wealthy can play entities such as hedge funds have manipulated markets behind the curtain for decades, leading to an unprecedented economic inequality in which the top 10% skim fully 97% of all income from capital. To have their game hijacked by a bunch of young gamers is beyond appalling to the New Nobility, who firmly believe their insider manipulations were the exclusive preserve of their crowd in the castle.

2. Not only are the mechanisms of manipulation now visible to all, an unruly rabble of commoners has ganged together to play their own version of the speculative game of skimming staggering profits from a rigged ""market."" How dare they!

No wonder the skimmers and scammers and political refuse that passes for ""leadership"" in today's America are shocked, shocked by the open and openly gleeful democratized speculation that (like cryptocurrencies) is enriching the wrong people, i.e. commoners.

It's as if the debt-serfs, tax donkeys and decapitalized peasants stormed the castle at night and broke open the jewel box and the stash of champagne, and proceeded to swing from the chandeliers, mocking the self-serving privileged who'd been pillaging the nation for decades via their legalized looting.

Where do these developments lead? An interesting question. Unfortunately for Wall Street insiders and their political-scum apologists, we can't unsee the levers behind the curtain."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185654.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|[]|[]

No! Don‚Äôt do it. You need to switch to an established broker that has in-house clearing. 

Here is a list of which brokers use which clearing houses. 

https://investorjunkie.com/stock-brokers/broker-clearing-firms/

If it says ‚ÄúApex‚Äù - stay the hell away. If it says Self clearing: No - stay the hell away. 

__*I know Rh is now self-clearing, but they do not have anywhere close to the required liquidity to handle the current volumes - so stay the hell away.__

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are GME or AMC gang or if you don‚Äôt plan on owning any of the meme stocks. Liquidity issues will effect other stocks too. Robinhood had to limit stocks like AMD, GM and even Starbucks. They can not keep up. Most of those other brokers also use the same clearing house - Apex Clearing. That‚Äôs a lot of volume to handle. They will be the weak link in the chain that causes the whole system to fail. They already did on Thursday. All the sketchy  shit pulled by various brokers was a direct result of Apex‚Äôs inability to keep up with demand. 

TLDR - find your broker on [this list](https://investorjunkie.com/stock-brokers/broker-clearing-firms/) and if they say ‚Äúself clearing -no‚Äù then you really should switch to a broker that is self-clearing

Most of them will be unretarded GME holders who are holding most of GME floats right now and don't share our love for the stock. Some of them will be fellow retards who have to give their dog surgery or put their girlfriends boyfriend through college, some of them may be you. Whatever the reason you will put up a sell order there is one thing to remember.

**WHILE IT IS IMPORTANT STOCK GOES UP IT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT STOCK DOESNT GO ALL THE WAY DOWN**

This üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ will keep flying as long as it doesn't hit the low price points that let hedges buy out their shorts. This means that even when GME drops at some point, as long as it doesn't drop low enough for hedges to cover, the fuel will keep coming. There is an easy way to keep this up.

**IF AT ANY POINT YOU FUCK UP AND SELL STOCK PUT DOWN A LOWER BUY ORDER AT THE SAME TIME**

As far as we know, hedges need to cover shorts at the < $320 range. If GME rockets to $1000 for example, and you need some cash to not starve to death and sell a share at $1000, immediately put down a buy order above $320. That way even if the stock falls a bit because of your paper hands, it will cushion at the new buy orders and start climbing back up.

**IF EVERYONE WHO SELLS PUTS A BUY ORDER AT A PRICE POINT THE STOCK CANNOT FALL BELOW THAT PRICE POINT**

I have no idea what is coming the next week or maybe even the next month. Maybe you retards crash the world economy. Maybe the stock will shoot high up and fall back down for a bit. I don't think however that the stock will tank all the way down to tens of $. There are too many of you retards who have bought up GME, locked it in a vault of your autism and thrown away the key. In normal stocks when price falls, people panic and sell until there is nothing left. You retards don't know how to sell and there is way too many of you.

The main explanation given for how that comes is naked shorts. 

What I want to understand is whether the same actual share can be sorted multiple times. 

For simplicity let‚Äôs assume no one has instructed their broker not to lend their shares. 

Let‚Äôs take an example where we have:

-	(A) - long GME
-	(B) - short GME
-	(C) - wants to buy GME
-	(D) - wants to short GME

(A) has bought 1 GME share. 

(A)‚Äôs broker has lent the share to (B) to short sell it. 

(C) buys the 1 share in GME. (C) has no idea that the share they are buying was sold to them by a short seller. 

Can (C)‚Äôs broker now lend that share to (D) to short it?

If not - why not? Forgetting any philosophical position around short selling overall, (C) has paid full price for a share, they should be able to make money by lending it. 

And what technical mechanism prevents this?

If yes, how are issues like voting and dividends dealt with. There is only one share but now two people own it - that doesn‚Äôt magically create 2 votes and 2 dividends.

l8w198|538.0|Can shorts actually afford to pay out a MOASS situation? Let's discuss how this actually plays out, the impact on the broader market, and some alternative plays (SPY puts?)|t3_l8w198|0.83|44|44|hot|2021-01-31 00:21:11.000000|smears|80|Discussion|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8w198/can_shorts_actually_afford_to_pay_out_a_moass/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8w198/can_shorts_actually_afford_to_pay_out_a_moass/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8w198/can_shorts_actually_afford_to_pay_out_a_moass/|"I am trying to think through this GME squeeze thing and am having a hard time wrapping my mind around how this actually plays out and we get away with a win and money in our pockets. I have not seen much discussion about this even in posts that are very knowledgeable about why this MOASS should happen.

I have a full grasp of the concept, I‚Äôve been in it since November. My biggest problem though is where does our money actually come from if a serious, monster squeeze goes down?

And, should those of us with other holdings be buying SPY puts as a hedge, or as a cheaper correlated MOASS play?

**How do we get our money?**

In the situation being kicked around across the internet with people demanding 1k, 5k even saying 30k a share.. I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúok but who can actually pay that cold hard cash that I can then take out to buy a house?‚Äù

The answer is of course the hedge funds by liquidating their positions elsewhere, using all the cash in their reserves and going bankrupt. So first off, wouldn't this cause a drop elsewhere like an immediate sector rotation as they panic sell? And maybe the situation isn‚Äôt that dire and paying the squeeze is doable by these funds- but maybe someone can confirm if they actually have that sort of money?

But then the next leap is if they can‚Äôt pay then the money comes from who? MMs and brokers who sold the positions? Will the same people who shut us out of the market actually pay that? And if so, where does that come from- the same place of liquidating? Or if they spend all their dry powder on this, doesn‚Äôt that shake the market?

Basically- wouldn‚Äôt the true, ultimate MOASS crash the stock market? Am I being crazy here?

**Outcomes Breakdown**

That brings me to- should we be hedging our other positions/sneakily playing the GME squeeze with puts? Here are some outcomes I've thought through:

* Situation 1: I am over stating this, shorts have the money in their reserves and can take loans etc and will cover if they have to- they just don't want to. Or there is no squeeze as they wait it out and escape. Loss on puts, possible loss on GME
* Situation 2: We are stuck at this level more or less for a few weeks or experience a TSLA-like melt up. People continue to sell other positions to move into impending squeeze, big buyers get wary of volatility and move to cash short term- small dip in SPY and GME is a slow tendie cooker.
* Situation 3: squeeze happens soon and violently, hedges fire sale to cover, there is an immediate medium but short market dip.
* Situation 4: hedges are bankrupted in a day or two of the MOASS and still have a ton left to cover, money has to come from elsewhere. Funds are pulled by big boys to pay out the losses. Robinhood and small brokers go bankrupt. Chaos and loss of confidence in the markets- large market dip/actual financial crisis??
* and my least favorite, Situation 5: if it‚Äôs true the MOASS would crash the market and that‚Äôs why they blocked it from happening this week, won‚Äôt they shut down the market before they let it happen? In this scenario, they close the market for the day, get the shorts to agree with GME management to issue millions of shares at a set rate they can afford, then tell all of us ‚Äúget fucked, you don‚Äôt deserve to profit off a short squeeze but now you have shares in a fundamentally sound company which you said you like so you should be happy?‚Äù Gme goes down to its ‚Äúreal value,‚Äù GME management gets billions to work with, maybe they give us a juicy dividend and become a gaming powerhouse, spy life goes on. Long term hold so not an absolute disaster, but ouch. Lots of anger.

As a last thought- If someone smarter than me steps in and says ‚Äúyes it‚Äôs true, there is no way there is enough money to pay anything over $1k/share outstanding and that is totally where we are going,‚Äù does that change our strategy? Because isn‚Äôt it better for us all to have $1k a share in hand than an IOU for 20k/share that will never be paid by a bankrupt hedge fund and bankrupt Robinhood, and a class action suit that goes nowhere? Plus it hurts us all to crash the market for real.

Open to any discussion on this end game.

**TLDR:** Would a MOASS crash the market because hedge funds and whoever else ends up responsible needs to pull money from elsewhere? And if so, should we be hedging or even buying cheap correlated plays through SPY puts? Lastly- if that is the case, we need to think about if the powers that be would let that happen, and how they would actually handle it.

Citadel owns Robinhood. The blatant restriction of trading stocks and crypt0 is a clear sign that Robinhood does not give a fuck about you, your tendies, or any other trader on their platform. Greasing the pockets of the wealthy is much higher on their list than ensuring traders a fair, open, competitive market.

The only way to win this battle is to boycott Robinhood, and any subsidiaries of Citadel LLC. Furthermore, we must file SEC complaints, and sue Robinhood. (Which we have already started!) We can not allow the rich, greedy, immoral tendie-thieves in power to thrive once again.

Like they did in 2008.

This is a monumental economical achievement, which will be written about in the history books. We took down a greedy, overreaching hedge fund.

This is my personal research into Pacific Gas & Electric Company. They have perpetuated evils on the environment and mankind. Not an endorsement- just some compiled findings. 

None of this is financial advice, and is purely fiction.

**MY FIRST DD AND ACTUALLY IDK WHAT I WANNA SAY BUT I RESEARCH A LITTLE SO LOOK IF U WANT, LET ME KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAVE ANY MORE TO ADD TO THIS CASE THANKS.**

*General Background*

>Sector: **Utilities**  
Industry: **Electric Utilities**  
>  
>PG&E Corp. is a holding company, which engages in generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and natural gas to customers. It specializes in **energy**, **utility**, **power**, **gas**, **electricity**, **solar and sustainability**.   
>  
>The company was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in San Francisco, CA.

[CHART & FINANCIALS](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-PCG/)

PG&E has a large market cap coming in at $22.684B. And had a revenue of $17.129B.

So why does it have such a negative cash flow? 

    A quick glance at the EBITDA also shows a glimmer of hope. But this metric can be misleading given the nature of the utility industry. Where depreciation and amortization can way heavy on their expenses, replacing power plants and equipment over their vast network is expensive. 

*The Compounding Risks*

You may have heard of how catastrophic this company has been to the environment and people of CA.

>In the last nine years, California has seen a growing number of unnatural disasters that have taken the lives of more than 90 people and caused more than $40 billion in damages. They all have one element in common: They were caused by California‚Äôs largest investor-owned utility, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E).

[HISTORY SOURCE -- LETS OWN PG&E](https://letsownpge.org/history/)

The impacts of these events can be felt for decades. Litigation is expensive and also takes years. 

    For example:
    In 2019 they paid $11B  for the California wildfires that torched wine country back in  2017 and for the Campfire in 2018 that killed 85 people and destroyed the town of Paradise, CA.

[2019 $11B SETTLEMENT SOURCE](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/13/760479525/pg-e-to-pay-11-billion-insurance-settlement-over-wildfires-in-paradise-and-elsew)

The litigation expenses caught up with PG&E.

**They filled chapter 11 bankruptcy on January 29th 2019.**

*What is chapter 11 bankruptcy, more specifically ""debtor in possession""?*

>Chapter 11 is typically used to reorganize a business, which may be a corporation, sole proprietorship, or partnership. A corporation exists separate and apart from its owners, the stockholders. The chapter 11 bankruptcy case of a corporation (corporation as debtor) does not put the personal assets of the stockholders at risk other than the value of their investment in the company's stock. A sole proprietorship (owner as debtor), on the other hand, does not have an identity separate and distinct from its owner(s). Accordingly, a bankruptcy case involving a sole proprietorship includes both the business and personal assets of the owners-debtors. Like a corporation, a partnership exists separate and apart from its partners. In a partnership bankruptcy case (partnership as debtor), however, the partners' personal assets may, in some cases, be used to pay creditors in the bankruptcy case or the partners, themselves, may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection.  
>  
>Section 1107 of the Bankruptcy Code places the debtor in possession in the position of a fiduciary, with the rights and powers of a chapter 11 trustee, and it requires the debtor to perform of all but the investigative functions and duties of a trustee. These duties, set forth in the Bankruptcy Code and Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, include accounting for property, examining and objecting to claims, and filing informational reports as required by the court and the U.S. trustee or bankruptcy administrator (discussed below), such as monthly operating reports. 11 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß¬†1106, 1107; Fed. R. Bankr. P. 2015(a). The debtor in possession also has many of the other powers and duties of a trustee, including the right, with the court's approval, to employ attorneys, accountants, appraisers, auctioneers, or other professional persons to assist the debtor during its bankruptcy case. Other responsibilities include filing tax returns and reports which are either necessary or ordered by the court after confirmation, such as a final accounting. The U.S. trustee is responsible for monitoring the compliance of the debtor in possession with the reporting requirements.

[US COURTS -- CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY](https://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-11-bankruptcy-basics)

Chapter 11 bankruptcy is going to come with added risks.

* The ability to develop, consummate, and implement a plan of reorganization with respect to PG&E Corporation and the Utility during the Chapter 11 Cases that satisfies all applicable legal requirements, including the requirements of AB 1054;
* The ability to develop and obtain applicable Bankruptcy Court, creditor, and regulatory approval of a successful plan of reorganization and the effect of any alternative proposals, views, and objections of official committees, creditors, state and federal regulators, and other stakeholders, which may make it difficult to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization in a timely manner and by June 30, 2020;
* The risk that the Note-holder RSA, the Subrogation RSA, the TCC RSA or the PSAs could be terminated; So far there is compelling evidence that there are a number of headwinds going forward.

These are 3 out of 17 risks PG&E is recognizing, with the possibility of more unseen risks. 

[2019 PCG 10k FILLINGS](https://last10k.com/sec-filings/pcg#i_0_40)

*What's next?*

So far there is compelling evidence of significant headwinds in PG&E's recovery.

1. Continuing litigations and settlements are costly.
2. Debt restructuring will come with its own risks. 

As a result of the wildfires Public Safety Power Shutoff was created.

**M A G I C   K A R P   T O   T H E   R E S C U E ! ! !**

**January 19th, 2021**

PG&E signed a multi-year, multi-million dollar contract with Palantir to provide Foundry software.

>Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) has initiated deployment of Palantir‚Äôs Foundry software to provide a single, integrated platform to give decision-makers a real-time, complete operational picture.  
>  
>The use of this novel technology, in its early stages of deployment, has already enabled PG&E to make effective, timely, data-driven decisions related to its Public Safety Power Shutoff program and is intended to further inform its wildfire risk mitigation programs and initiatives in the future.  
>  
>‚ÄúOur engagement with California‚Äôs largest investor-owned utility underlines our commitment to increasing safety and reliability for customers and communities across the region,‚Äù said Olivier Farache, Palantir‚Äôs Head of Utility Sector and Senior Advisor to the CEO. ‚ÄúIt shows our Foundry software can power data-driven decisions that aim to improve service delivery.‚Äù

[SOURCE](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210119005164/en/Palantir-Providing-Technology-to-Enhance-Safety-and-Reliability-of-Electric-Grid-in-California)

The increasing size and magnitude of PG&E's operation innately led to an increase in disasters.

 & Corruption within the company have slowed recovery and any efforts towards lasting change on its infrastructure.  

With the use of Foundry this could be the start of less wildfires and a more efficient utility company. 

The road ahead is a tough one for PG&E. But its tempting when its stock price is at levels we have not seen since 1999. And when debt restructuring + Foundry software could change the long term out look of the company. 

**The play?**

Bull case: Foundry significantly helps mitigate disasters and debt restructuring is approved quickly... **$17c Expiring December 17th**

Currently (Jan 29th, 2021) they are priced at $0.99.

Has you used either of these before? If you have, what is your experience with either of these two companies? Everything from ease of use or UI to their customer service. Also do they come with fees or anything like that? All input is appreciated and it‚Äôs a shame that so many big brokers did dirty on their customers but it‚Äôs good that it shed light on who the real brokers should be.

Edit: It‚Äôs safe to say 90%+ of the commenters here argue that fidelity is the go to. A good portion of the fidelity backers say the only upgrade Fidelity really needs is to get a cleaner UI and it will be a go to platform for a lot of investors.

I'm just a dumbass with some life experience to share.

**First, buy some goddamn personal umbrella insurance.** It's cheap af, like I pay $400 a year for mine. And it's easy af to buy. What is umbrella insurance? It's something poor people will never have to worry about, so be glad it's in your life now. **It protects you from lawsuits by parasites by adding million(s) of dollars in personal liability coverage above and beyond the policy limits of your auto, renters or homeowners insurance.**

Your shitty auto/renter/homeowners policies have limits of a couple hundred thousand bucks max. If you hit somebody's car, if someone slips and falls in your house, if someone accuses you of sexual assault, odds are there they will want to sue you. Any plaintiff's attorney worth half a fuck that they hire is going to do their research on you and when they do their DD and find out you have tons of assets now, they are going to come after way more than what they wanted thinking you were just some broke nobody. Umbrella insurance protects you from the unlikely but ever present threat of bankruptcy through lawsuits now that you are a big rich target. I've seen way too many idiot doctors and successful small business owners lose their life's work through negligence lawsuits and not having umbrella policies in place that would have stopped it.

Which brings me to my second request of you. Don't make yourself an obvious target. **Keep your goddamn mouth shut about your tendies and tell no one the particulars. Don't even fucking hint at it** (in real life that is, say whatever you want anonymously on WSB. Half my post history is about my net worth, ffs). Don't tell dad to make him proud, don't tell strangers to impress them and feel good, don't tell some girl to get her to fuck you. I don't care if you shower the people you love with gifts, it's none of my business. If they ask, just say you had a good year trading and leave it at that.

Neither of my parents know about my trading profits, nor that I'm a millionaire. None of my friends know. I'll go to my grave not telling a soul. Because I see how people treat the people I know IRL who do flaunt it and I'm disgusted how some people (not all) no longer view you as a person, just something to exploit.

**Why tf should you listen to me? Maybe you shouldn't. I was wrong af about GME.** I posted how I thought it was trash from $10 to $30 and while I thought u/DeepFuckingValue deserved props for eating shit all year and holding strong, I thought the rest of you were FOMO sheep chasing it in the $20s. Mea culpa. I'm glad I was wrong. I've never seen so many rattled old white men before in my life before this week and it's great. I'm genuinely happy for you guys that hit it big and hope the squeeze isn't over. Please consider what I've said. Thanks.

**(edit) Mods, it's okay to delete this repost if you deem it necessary. I'm honestly really disappointed that u/DeepFuckingValue was identified by the WSJ and other media outlets in the days since I first posted it. I was hoping he would stay anonymous and ride off into the sunset, but it's none of my business if he didn't want that for himself. Hoping others will see this and think about it before going public.**"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185634.csv|StockTicker|['I']|[]|['WSB', 'I', 'I', 'DD', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'IRL', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'FOMO', 'I', 'WSJ', 'I', 'I']|['DD', 'IRL', 'GME']

I work for a retailer, not GME, and about 8 years ago the short sellers came a knocking. They blasted us daily saying retail is dead.  Full blown media attack to change public opinion (shitty practice). They drove the stock from $60s down to under $10. They made their money and thousands of employees were laid off. Today, the stock is over $100. 

CNBC shills say that short sellers keep the market honest to prevent poor idiots from losing their life savings to Madoff. BULL SHIT. Those same funds were all in bed with that scum bag and only went short after it became public that he was a douche.

Edit 5: So, since people are reading (wut?), I figured I'd give some context about my sad miserable fucking life to maybe get you guys more JACKED TO THE TITS:

2 years ago I was hospitalized with the worst bout of depression. I never imagined how bad depression could be. I was weeping literally every day. Couldn't do shit but cry all the time and contemplate why I was even fucking here. I was going to school to get into a career that I didn't even want to be in, and I legitimately felt like I was a useless POS that was only a drain on everyone around me and they'd all be better off if I was gone. That depression took EVERYTHING from me.. my confidence, self-esteem, self-worth, humor, and much more. Now, I'm a garbage man in NJ with a fucking bachelor's degree and student loan debt and I live in a fucking doll house owned by my wife's grandparents, right next door to her nosy ass parents, cause we can't afford shit else. Thankfully her boyfriend chips in on rent so he has a discreet place to bang her whenever he wants. My life these past 2 years has been a slow climb out of the fucking abyss, and for the first time in 2 years, I have something that has me literally uncontrollably excited! I started trading a few months ago with everything I had saved up (not much). All ""smart"" investments with long-term growth almost guaranteed. Then, here you fucks come along with an idea for the heist of the century. I read the posts, saw the action, and said ""You son of a bitch, I'm in."" I sold almost all of my PUSSY stocks and stuck my dick in GME! THIS IS EVERYTHING I HAVE. IF A GARBAGE MAN CAN HOLD MONEY THAT WOULD PROVIDE A NICE COMFORTABLE CUSHION, SO CAN YOU!! üíéüôåü¶çüçå LET'S FUCKING DO THIS.. AGAIN NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE!

As my hands start to be come solid diamond, I can‚Äôt help but think of what to do with my money. I have no credit card debt. In fact my only debt is my car ( which will be paid off next week without GME cash) and my student loans. 

To me, this is a rare opportunity to make some money turn into more money. Could this be a seed to start a portfolio for retirement? Is it smart to pay off all debts before you start investing?

Until it does, ignore the distractions of AMC, silver, etc. There's never been anything like this moment in history. There's gonna be margin calls, bankruptcies and before it's over, probably sooner rather than later, 10000 GME.

The hedgies are all over social media spraying a lot of chaff about silver, AMC, BB, etc. That's because how we're expressing our love for GME (BUYING AND HOLDING) is working.

Someone is stealing new Reddit accounts somehow and drumming up market sentiment around our beloved memestonks. We ordinary apes simply like these stonks, but whoever's doing this reddit account stealing has ulterior, possibly shady motives.

This particular instance, I have a theory that this was part of the propaganda campaign that was aiming to instill a sense of urgency and disappointment after the squeeze didn't happen this week. Notice how it says ""... this thing is happening in the next few days."" We all know it didn't happen, of course, but this comment was posted before a bunch of stonk apps removed the ability to buy memestonks, which led to a subsequent series of short ladder attacks drilling down the prices of our beloved memestonks.

I think this is another piece of the puzzle pointing to a very real possibility of an alleged concerted, co-operative operation by the hedge funds which are short GME in order to manipulate the memestonk price and drive it down to ""normal levels"" (fuck you Interactive Brokers you fucking pieces of shit). Hey SEC, if you're not all corrupt assholes like these online broker CEOs, look into this will ya please?

I don't think this is nefarious - I've seen this 404 error since at least November.**

**Update 2: Robinhood makes money LENDING OUT YOUR SHARES to shorts AND THEY KEEP THE INTEREST. if you switch to a Robinhood Cash account, they will be unable to lend out your shares.**

A ton of this sub uses Robinhood and after what happened the last few days, we all want to jump ship.

Not only did Robinhood restrict buying of GME, but since we are all on Margin Accounts, technically Robinhood owns the stock and simply passes many of the rights of ownership to us, crediting us with quasi-ownership.

This is important because if Robinhood fails, we don't actually own our stocks - Robinhood does and those shares we paid a lot for could just as well go bye-bye.

The obvious solution is to get the fuck off Robinhood, but it ain't that simple. If you begin a transfer of your assets to another brokerage, your positions will be frozen for up to 2 weeks. Every single day counts right now, and that is simply not an option.

As much as we shit on Robinhood, we really need to be rooting for them to succeed and get an influx of cash to be able to post it as collateral with DTCC to get our trading activity back to normal.

All that being said... there is an alternative solution to save our asses:

**Robinhood Cash Accounts**

[Details here - CLICK MEEEEE\~](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/)

In short, when you sign up for Robinhood you start off with a **Robinhood Instant** account. This is a margin account.

If you're like many of the retards on here, you upgraded it to a **Robinhood Gold** account. This is still a margin account.

There is a third option: a **Robinhood Cash** account. You do not get access to instant deposits. You do not get access to instant settlements. If you sell anything, you'd need to wait 2 trading days before having access to the cash. Essentially, you're no longer relying on the magic of margin accounts to make everything look instantaneous to you.

Does that suck? Yeah, kinda, but **you get full control and ownership of your shares**.

I will be downgrading my account to a Robinhood Cash Account and once this is all over, I'll be transferring to another brokerage."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185646.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'NDING', 'OUT', 'YOUR', 'HARES', 'AND', 'THEY', 'KEEP', 'THE', 'EREST', 'A', 'GME', 'DTCC', 'CLICK', 'I']|['GME']

Look. In 1999 mark cuban wanted to lock in his broadcast.com gains but held only yahoo stock he couldn‚Äôt sell for 3 years. So what he did was buy what‚Äôs called a collar which often costs little to nothing.  So if a monkkeee wanted to hold but didn‚Äôt want big loss they could theoretically take some lots of 100 and for each one they could sell a 2023 call and buy a 2023 put.  This locks all gains and you can hold theoretically forever by rolling, and essentially makes it where you only can get called away at say $400+.  

Does this make sense or am I missing something? This is legit just a question as I‚Äôm a  humble moron and don‚Äôt know anything so this is NOT financial advice. I‚Äôm literally just curious.

Downside maybe  is that call buyers of the calls you sell could then lock in at whatever the strike was preventing a big squeeze on price for them, but maybe upside makes it easy for people to keep holding. Maybe allows people to diversify without fear of losing it all

Can someone please clear this up for me?

 I know a lot of you fuckers are already in MAC and we can make another round of people rich. Note I have a $1k stock position in MAC, so this isn't a big money maker for me since I didn't buy call options -- but I'm going to... I just want to share what I've found and how I see things, so hopefully we can have another round of poors becoming wealthy during this fucked up pandemic.

Why I think MAC is such a hold position is because look at the short interest: https://imgur.com/a/YY9Ymku. It has been at or near 70% for a long time and the short interest is dropping (see graph on imgur slide). Why I think this is important is because MAC was trading around $6 a year ago. I think a lot of shorts are already trapped at the low prices -- probably shorts at really low prices that can't get out because the current price. (That's my logic at least, someone with more market knowledge please let me know if that's not the correct way to think about things.)

Also, I think MAC has been collecting rent and has good financials/cash (like GME), so it is undervalued. (Can someone grab a good article so we can lay out the value play on MAC?)

MACs market cap is a lot bigger (5x's) that of where Gamestop was at. I think this may make it harder to squeeze -- but someone with more knowledge can maybe chime in.

Thoughts and help appreciated. And, if I'm totally idiotic, you can tell me that too.

EDIT: One other thought -- MAC is a good short-term and long-term play. If you look at options, they're really cheap. Now go look at the 5 day chart -- see how the stock has been bouncing off $23? If you buy the cheapest February call options, I think you can easily make it to $23 -- and I think there's a possibility for a lot of $$$$$ to be had. I can't trade options right now because it's taking forever to get money into my trading account (oh, yeah, I never traded until GME and I've never traded options, so again, I'm a retard). But -- DFV made the majority of his money on calls so if one of you fuckers strike it rich on the option, at least leave me a thumbs up on here.

After Reagan declared war on family farms and kicked out agricultural subsidies and commodities purchasing by the USDA to support family farms, it took about a year before the Farm Crisis got into full swing. My Dad made the TV news when our family dairy was the first in Northern Minnesota to be put on the block by the FDIC as they liquidated our bank to ‚Äúprotect investors‚Äù.

My father began a process of making progressively more desperate bets in order to try to support his family, sold Shaklee, was in three or four multi-level marketing schemes, sold insurance, ran a saw mill, started a small handicap equipment manufacturing company, before throwing in the towel and accepting what money I and my brother could spare him from our student loans. When I joined the Navy in desperation (abandoning college), all their utilities were cut off and he had finally given in and accepted welfare and food stamps.

Over the years, he finally got a service connected disability (Vietnam), and after my mother passed, now lives, not comfortably, but adequately. His story is finally to its ‚Äúhappy ending‚Äù(?).
My road has been paved with extremely hard work, and I am doing okay, no thanks to the powers that be. Completed my service in 1992, did okay as a blue-, then white-collar person, until 2008...declared bankruptcy to save my family‚Äôs home, out the other side and finally, I think, going to make it. No retirement in our future; at least not yet; but we‚Äôre okay.

So, I hope you accept this disenfranchised Gen-Xer, and thanks for the welcome.

Right now we have two different POV 

1) The wsbetters are going to earn a lot of money because the big squeeze is on the horizon 

2) The wsbetters are going to lose a lot of money because the HF already succesfully exited. 

My opinion is that The most exposed shorts were closed two days ago, but there is still a lot of pain in front of them (so, hold, I hate them) but The entire market is going to de-leverage, and start to go down, and, guess what? They'll blame WSB for this.

Lucky for you I have two things that can add 20 carats to your diamond hands in 10 minutes.

First is /u/deepfuckingvalue's DD video from last August. It's only 5 minutes long, but when legends speak you listen carefully. Word of advice you might need to play it at 0.5x because in true autist fashion DFV speaks many good words very very fast.

Second is a tool my (probably autistic) friend made. No one wants to use it because it's boring as shit but basically it lets people slap quizzes onto videos.

I threw some curveballs in so if you get everything right then you know why you like this stock.

Engage diamond hands, keep up on DD, and don't blink because we're riding up this week.

I read WSB for like 12 hours a day and miss new posts all the time.

*Disclaimer: I'm a moron and not a financial expert, I own GME shares. This is all my opinion.*

Hello, my fellow retards. This GME movement has been seriously heartening for the common man, and the following that WSB has gained because of it is completely bonkers. This is all well and good, but on some level, GME is still a numbers game to me. Melvin announced that it had closed its position in GME and everyone here instantly doubted such a claim. I have some 8 pm coffee-fueled napkin math that suggests... maybe?

**Point 1:**

[Here](https://www.shortvolume.com/) is a website I've found very confirmation bias-y. It gives some ballpark numbers for short positions changed day by day. Over the last 10 days, we see a short volume of approximately 200m. That is a lot of changing shorts and give ample time for Melvin to have exited their short -at first glance at least. If we assume that every single one of those shorts was taking a new position as the price continued to rise over the last several days we see that from 1/22 through 1/26 there is approximately \~82m shorts changing hands in the sub $133 price range. Then, from 1/27 to 1/29 (after GME broke $300) there is \~34m short volume. If we assume that EVERY SINGLE SHORT got out, then bought back in as the price rose for the last \~80m volume (to ultimately bring us to the SI estimate today) the best price that the shorts could possibly be holding, on average, is about **$180 per short**. In other words, **shorts are still massively underwater even if they've been frantically covering and doubling down for the last week**.

**Point 2:**

CNBC could be lying.

**Point 3:**

[CNBC could be telling the truth.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/gamestop-short-sellers-are-still-not-surrendering-despite-nearly-20-billion-in-losses-this-year.html) This article mentions what a few experts (yes, Shkreli is an expert here) have said at this point: WATCH THE INTEREST RATE. If melvin exited their position as fast as they could, and there were not enough new shorts to pick up the slack, the interest rate would fall through the floor. I am taking this with a grain of salt considering that shorts have been doubling down throughout this month, but Melvin having probably the single largest short position on GME would definitely shake up the numbers. Edit: u/_UDW mentioned that [Ihor Dusaniwsky](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/gamestop-short-sellers-are-still-not-surrendering-despite-nearly-20-billion-in-losses-this-year.html?utm_content=Main&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook&fbclid=IwAR1DG7CAHua6XMuTf1zcioplEVRMnC-59LcNaiL-ck3qrklMsBDhtbfGytQ#Echobox=1611941927) also disagreed with the possible Melvin exit.

**Point 4, the Devils Advocate:**

Melvin, as per the CNBC article, completely exited its position on 1/26. That Tuesday was two things: the cleanest rising day we've had since $35, and some of the highest volume GME has ever seen. In my opinion, that rise could have been caused by constant buying pressure as Melvin unwinded their position, and there was definitely the volume to support that kind of a move without *completely* fucking the price.

**My conclusions:**

Melvin being out or not isn't a huge deal, but it does make the squeeze less sweet if they are gone. I am positive that a multibillion-dollar hedge fund would rather book a 30% year loss than a bankruptcy, and that they are at least hedging their position like a madman. However, at this point, someone is still holding a -100% bag at *least* and these new shorts entering GME, then leaving almost a day later with a complete loss will push some crazy momentum into the stock so long as it generally goes sideways or up.

TR;CR:

Melvin is probably lying but it doesn't matter, buy GME. \*rocket emoji\*"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185640.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['DD', 'I', 'WSB', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'WSB', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'EVERY', 'INGLE', 'SHORT', 'SI', 'CNBC', 'CNBC', 'WATCH', 'THE', 'EREST', 'RATE', 'I', 'GME', 'UDW', 'CNBC', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'GME']|['DD', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'RATE', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

He danced around the question of why he did this by alluding to how he wanted to protect investors. This is all a SHAM.

There is a significant chance that had they not halted trading on the relevant stocks, they would've been **insolvent** by close of trading, depending on the size of their credit line. **This is why they raised $1 billion as an emergency from investors**. The reason why he wasn't clear about this, was because if you admit on TV that your company is experiencing liquidity issues -- even if temporary in nature such as with clearing custodianship requirements -- you run the risk of triggering a greater panic through customer withdrawals/redemptions. You also run the risk of going insolvent. **It is no coincidence that they've been halting buying on literally any asset as soon as the volume on it starts to massively increase.**

This could turn into a run on the brokerage pretty quickly, and probably already has in some measure, especially after a day of massively lost customer trust. Vlad certainly didn't help it by going on TV and lying about their liquidity issues.

**First we examine the brokerages finances**  
 

TD Ameritrade - (2019 Average - 860,000 Trades per day, 11 million accounts and **1 TRILLION in net assets held by clients**.

(Data limited no IPO) Robinhood - (2020, 13 million accounts, 4.3 million trades, $150 billion in transactions.

E-Trade - (2019 - **398.6 billion retail assets** \+ 365 billion corporate service assets, Morgan Stanley purchased E-Trade to have a combined **3.1 Trillion in Assets**, in addition Morgan Stanley had **38.947 Billion** in free cash flow for 2019. )

Charles Schwab - (2020 - **6.69 Trillion in client assets**, Averaged 8.191 MILLION trades per day. 

eToro - (2020 -1.5 Trillion trade value cleared in a year... or **4.109 Billion per day**. 17 million users.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Next lets examine GME volume**

&amp;#x200B;

On Monday and Tuesday (25/01/2021 (DD/MM/YYYY) was at 177 million @ $100 a share, 

91 Million Wednesday @ $350 a share, 

and finally 42 million on Thursday @ high of 470 and average at 240 .

This adds up to 17.7 billion traded value Monday and Tuesday

31.85 Billion traded value Wednesday

10.08 Billion Thursday

**(Stick with me here)**

Now remember these companies are used to trading $GME at an average volume of 40 million a day with a share price of $10 or a net total of 4 Billion traded value. So in your head take out 4 billion from each of the total traded value of the stock for each day, and that is the numbers we are working with. 

Now compare this to Tesla, This year they experienced an average volume of 34.76 million. However their volume changed from the lowest over the year at 17 million @ a share price of 417.13, compared to the highest on the year at 222.13 million shares traded @ a price of $695. Those two numbers add up to **7.091 billion on their lowest day and 154.38 billion on their highest.**

**Now remember how we just saw that on $GME highest daily traded volume ever recorded they barely touched a change in value of 32 billion??? Yet somehow we see eToro, Robinhood, Charles Schwab, E-Trade and TD Ameritrade all restrict $GME because as they claim, ""They ran out of money"" So they can front the cost of 154 billion in a day for trading 1 stock but can't cover the 32 billion on a different day for a stock that has significant impact on their relationship with one of their banks?**

Now you tell me? Were we seconds away from igniting the largest wealth transfer in history? Were we seconds away from giving money to people who will give back, those who can help the single mother or homeless man on the side of the road because they aren't a billionaire themselves they are just another human who lives in a neighborhood, who passes the homeless man, talks to the single mother, works 12 hour shifts. We were seconds away from a wealth transfer not to a billionaire who will write a 40 million check to a charity that takes 80% for ""Admin cost"" but to you, me and every other person who has the ability and desire to change the lives of those around them for the better not just through a smile as you walk by or a bummed cigarette late on a Friday night, but through a physical way that only wealth can distribute.

Keep your head up, The math on this is simple, they are playing you. üëêüíéüëê

You're doing something a lot of people in this world don't bother to, and seeing all of the posts of people paying off homes, cars, student loans, and so on melt my heart.

Before the GMREEEEEEEEs that have infiltrated every financial sub on the planet start shrieking about me insinuating you should cash out, *you make your own decisions on your own risk tolerance*. *You do what's best for you*.

Now, **when you do** **cash out of** ***any position,*** **give smart**. I've been in the nonprofit world for a while and can tell you there's a lot of ""charities"" out there that do fuck all with the money you give them or just let it sit in their account for the duration of the disaster that people were donating to alleviate (looking at you, Red Cross).

It makes me physically ill to think of your giving going to waste. I'm not going to tell you to give to the arts, or to medicine, or to space exploration. Just be sure to investigate where you're giving and don't trust the ""Top 10 charities for X"" posts you see all over the interwebs. I have provided for your sleuthing pleasure a few websites to vet your giving. They will allow you to search by name, type, etc. Give them a look and see.

[https://www.charitywatch.org](https://www.charitywatch.org/) \- Will tell you how the charity compensates their executives, their cost-to-raise ratio, and the program to overhead ratio.

[https://www.givewell.org](https://www.givewell.org/) \- Another organization that researches top charities to provide transparent data.

[https://www.charitynavigator.org/](https://www.charitynavigator.org/) \- Probably the most in-depth of the bunch on the ones that they review. They go into detail on the impact, results, accountability, and culture of whatever organization you look up.

Also, there's a boat load of foundations out there that would love to take your money and watch it grow. Many of them already have securities and other assets. *You can sometimes donate assets directly and the wealth keeps growing.* \*\*You can also bequeath another account to an organization.\*\*This means you don't touch it but name your charity as a beneficiary. Let it grow, then when you die, Tendie Claus will drop it in their chimney. For more information:

[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/donatestock.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/donatestock.asp)

Other points to consider: Cost-to-raise is not always a good measure, so do your DD on charities. For charities that have most or all of their capital and assets donated, the cost-to-raise should be exorbitantly low. Don't confuse PACs with charities. Here's an example: PACs donate to pro-X legislation and legislators. Charities donate their services, products, and education falling under the X rubric to people in need.

If you're more interested in activism and advocacy, you can find some great resources here:

[https://www.opensecrets.org/527s/types.php](https://www.opensecrets.org/527s/types.php) \- Watchdog for PACS[https://www.fec.gov/data/committees/?committee\_type=O](https://www.fec.gov/data/committees/?committee_type=O) \- List of Super-PACs

[https://www.fec.gov/data/committees/](https://www.fec.gov/data/committees/) \- List of hybrid PACs

My apologies to the Europoors. Can't help you because I'm a lowly American't.

Bless all you magnificent bastards who have already done God's work in sharing the wealth you've accumulated on your own volition.

Tl;dr: Use these resources to research companies before you consider donating.

Edit: There are some 3rd party services out there that help certain non-profit organizations (charities and companies alike) with what we call ""passive investment"" or ""passive activism."" Amazon Smile is a good example of this. A portion of your purchase goes to whatever 501c(3) company you select that's registered. But it's ü•ú compared to an actual gift.

Edit 2: Thank you u/onomoto81 for the link to a philanthropy podcast that discusses the considerations you should evaluate before giving ever and at all. I skimmed it and it seems on the up and up. Philosophical but at least worth the listen.

If the Borrow Fee is around 32.8% \[[3](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)\], then at the current stock price of $325 the short holders would be paying $18 million per day if they don't cover (.328\*$325\*61.78 million/365 = $18 million).  The cost to cover the shorts right now would be $20 billion ($325\*61.78 million).

Let's imagine a second scenario in which they wait and assume the stock price will slowly fall to $150 over the next year. In this scenario, they'd pay a total of $3.35 billion over the course of the year in Borrow Fees, and then cover their shorts for another $9.27 billion. That'd bring the total to $3.35+9.27 = $12.62 billion.  So they'd save $7.38 billion dollars.

Obviously this would be a bet by them that the price would fall, and if it doesn't they just wasted another $3.35 billion in paying a years worth of borrow fees. But is there anything to stop them from trying to go this route? What would cause the broker to demand the hedge funds buy back all their shorts immediately?"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185637.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|[]|[]

There are large banks currently naked shorting silver on the futures markets one of them is JP Morgan. It is essential to understand that there is an interest in suppressing the price of silver as every increase undermines the confidence in the U.S. Dollar. 

What is essential to know about SLV is the following: 

> The sponsor of the Trust is iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC (the ‚ÄúSponsor‚Äù), a Delaware limited liability company and an indirect subsidiary of
BlackRock, Inc. (‚ÄúBlackRock‚Äù). The trustee of the Trust is The Bank of New York Mellon (the ‚ÄúTrustee‚Äù) and the custodian of the Trust is JPMorgan Chase
Bank N.A., London branch (the ‚ÄúCustodian‚Äù). The agreement between the Trust and the Custodian is governed by English law. The Trust does not have any
officers, directors or employees.

The same bank that is heavily shorting silver is the custodian of $SLV.  The last time someone tried to increase the price of silver the FED created a special rule to fuck them. The two speculators that tried and successfully (for a time) controlled the majority of silver were billionaires even before their action in the silver markets. After the intervention from the FED, they went broke, billionaires going broke isn't something you hear often. 

Be sure that you know what you are getting into and do not use money that you cannot afford to lose. If you think you can compete against the largest banks in the nation and the FED you are wrong. The price might go up for a time but the crash will be swift."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185640.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['SLV', 'JP', 'U', 'S', 'SLV', 'LLC', 'N', 'A', '$SLV', 'FED', 'FED', 'FED']|[]

He'll be around in the thread to answer questions

We are going to look at¬†**Biocryst‚Äôs**¬†recently approved drug¬†**Berotralstat**, AKA¬†**Orladeyo**. It is a¬†**once-a-day pill**¬†given to patients with a terrible lifelong disease called¬†**Hereditary Angioedema**, that results in them having to¬†**frequently visit the Emergency Room**¬†for life-threatening angioedema attacks (check out Youtube for videos of HAE patients suffering from these attacks and using Berotralstat). It is estimated that this disease affects¬†**1 in 50,000**¬†people in the world, or roughly¬†**140,000 people**, so although considered a rare disease, it is still affecting a¬†**lot**¬†of folks.

The available treatments for this disease are¬†**all IV drugs**¬†that are painful and produce local reactions. Berotralstat is the¬†**first oral drug**. It achieved excellent results in phase 3 trials, and the US FDA gave it¬†**fast track**¬†status in 2018 and Japan gave it¬†**Sakigake**¬†status (type of fast track). Then¬†**on December 3rd, the US granted approval for the drug**. They did it very importantly with¬†**zero label**¬†statements--meaning that they had no concerns about side effects or dangers.¬†**On January 22nd, Japan granted approval**. The¬†**EU**¬†also met last week to discuss approval and will announce its result¬†**this quarter**.

So let's look at what the above means for this stock. First the drug is in¬†**HIGH**¬†demand. In the US there are at least¬†**10,000**¬†people with HAE. Despite the disease being frequently debilitating, patients are so uncomfortable about getting regular injections that¬†**only 7,500**¬†are currently being treated with IV injections. The other 2,500 are going¬†**untreated**¬†despite the high risks. Now let's look at the 7,500 patients on a prophylactic treatment. Based on numerous surveys by doctors, the company, and researchers, most of these people would prefer an oral treatment. Take a look at this peer-reviewed survey article finding that¬†[98% of IV prophylactic patients (the 7,500) would prefer an oral treatment and 96% of the non-prophylactic patients (the 2,500) would want an oral treatment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489436/).

No wonder then that one of the preeminent biotech analysts, Evercore's Liisa Bayko, wrote to her clients on December 4th that Berotralstat was likely to quickly¬†**take at least 30% of the HAE market**¬†based on Evercore surveys of patient and doctor demand.

Remember that this is¬†**just the US**.... Japan did not even have any prophylactic treatment until Berotralstat was approved there a few days ago. They have¬†**500 people registered with HAE**¬†and estimated¬†**2,000 ready to be registered**. [The¬†UK¬†is so desperate to add the drug for its patients, it did not even wait until the formal approval process to go through and gave¬†early access to the drug on November 9th](https://angioedemanews.com/2020/11/09/berotralstat-available-to-eligible-patients-uk-through-early-access-program/#:~:text=Berotralstat%20%E2%80%94%20an%20oral%20therapy%20by,before%20its%20potential%20regulatory%20approval).

The EU is not far behind, with its estimated¬†**20,000 patients**, with approval coming in the next few weeks. Then there is the rest of the world. The HAE patient population in¬†**Latin America**¬†is estimated by¬†**HAE International**, the most important advocacy organization for HAE patients worldwide and one of¬†**Berotralstat‚Äôs biggest supporters**, to be¬†**over 15,000 patients**, the vast majority of whom are poorly diagnosed and not prophylactically treated. Argentina and Brazil have the highest actual diagnostic rates. HAEI through its Latin American sister organizations is strongly advocating for Berotralstat in Latin America.

Next, it should be noted that Biocryst built a¬†**world-class sales team**¬†for this drug in the US and EU and signed a¬†**partnership with Torii in Japan**¬†to take charge of the large sales and marketing promotion there. It has hired dozens of professionals, most from its HAE competitors. Its¬†**vice-president**¬†and US general manager¬†**Allen Hodge**¬†was even responsible for the¬†**successful efforts of the HAE drug launches**¬†of Cinryze and Firazyr, two pioneering injectable treatments for HAE. You could not get a more promising leader for this task.

It should also be pointed out that this drug, an oral kallikrein inhibitor, is potentially of¬†**huge value for a host of diseases, including COVID-19**¬†(that is now recognized to severely affect the kallikrein-kinin system, and kallikrein inhibitors have begun to be tested against COVID19--see this (IV)¬†**kallikrein inhibitor trial that was just announced in Brazil**¬†for instance:¬†[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/)),¬†**diabetic macular edema**¬†(which Biocryst just obtained a patent on a technique to administer kallikrein inhibitors for), many autoimmune diseases, and even some types of cancer.

Last but not least, how should this stock be valued based on this one drug? First, this drug is¬†**one of the 10 most expensive drugs**¬†(based on its annual cost of prescription) in the world, but still¬†**less than the price of its IV competitors**, at $488,000 per patient per year. This drug is being approved by insurance companies¬†**left, right, and center**¬†as their preferred treatment, all you have to do is follow¬†[R8](https://stocktwits.com/R8Plus)¬†or¬†[nickpd](https://stocktwits.com/nickpd) on Stocktwits to see how many insurance companies have been making it easy for patients to sign up for the drug.¬†[Optime care¬†even lets patients get¬†direct-to-patient¬†prescriptions now](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biocryst-scores-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-first-oral-option-to-prevent-hae-attacks).

So what does all this mean for sales? And why is the stock not valued based on just this drug alone (I will get to the others in¬†**future posts**)? I¬†**estimate conservatively**¬†that by December 2021, there will be¬†**over 6,000 patients on Berotralstat in the US, EU and Japan**, and I can share in a future post the graphs and calculations I made to get to those numbers. 6,000 patients annualized is up to¬†**$2.9 billion in annual sales**.¬†**Most**¬†of this is going to be¬†**profit**. At a¬†**conservative price to sales ratio of 7**, that should produce a price of¬†**$121, not $8.52**!  If you want to play around with the math yourself, look [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLvclUzTqCitwKfawL7kGCLquJxA2T7IJKLg52VWotE/edit?usp=sharing).

And that is¬†**just the beginning**. Because Factor D and Galidesivir are going to be much bigger than Berotralstat for reasons I will explain in future posts. Remember that¬†**its Factor D drug, which is showing superiority to all other anti-complement drugs in Phase I trials and was fast-tracked and given orphan status by the FDA and now is in Phase 2 though not officially announced by the company eyt,**¬†and can be used in at least 20 diseases including common ones like Rheumatoid Arthritis, is currently¬†**not even factoring into BCRX's valuation**. Consider that¬†**Alexion with its significantly inferior anti-complement drug was just sold to Astra-Zeneca for $39 billion**¬†because of the¬†**recognized potential of anti-complement drugs**¬†for a host of diseases. BCRX even has has¬†**other drugs like Peramivir, already approved for Influenza and able to be used for the next bird flu pandemic, and its FOP drug--a story for another day**.

So why is this company, with¬†**zero risk of dilution**¬†due to an¬†**amazing royalty deal**¬†it signed in December and¬†**three super-drugs**¬†each worth tens of billions of dollars, and a host of other exciting developments to look forward to,¬†**worth only $1.5 billion right now?**¬†It can only be because the company's stock has been¬†**relentlessly shorted in 2020 and 2021**¬†to allow for significant accumulation by institutions. That is why the stock¬†**only went up 168%**, yes ""***ONLY***""¬†**168%**...

The time for BCRX investors is¬†**now**. My next post will be about Factor D, brace for that one. Factor D is 10 times bigger than Berotralstat! Good luck to all!

Which is a federal organization that insures your portfolio. UP TO $500k and a LIMIT OF $250k for cash. 

So don‚Äôt worry the $5 you got from your grandma is safe even if Robinhood goes down. Now if they do go down, which i doubt they will. Then after everything settles you should expect your money after a few months.

So its not lost. 

One thing to note is, if you own stocks on robinhood SPIC will pay the amount of the stock at the time of liquidation not when the broker goes down. 

So lets say RH goes down tomorrow and GME traded at $500. When SPIC starts to act and reimburse you for your shares they won‚Äôt give it to you at $500. They‚Äôll return it to you at the current market price.

Tl;DR: if we simply stay put we can guarantee the absolute best outcome for all. If we act selfishly we guarantee the worst outcome for all.


For those that have a pimple in their otherwise smooth brains:

The prisoners dillema suggests that people when confronted with the opportunity to cooperate to guarantee a good outcome for all will generally act selfishly and end up worse than if they had cooperated.

 However experiments show that humans are biased towards cooperation and will in real situations, more often than not, cooperate for a generally better outcome for all.

Here‚Äôs why I support the $GME $BB $BBBY and $AMC movement.  


I am older than y‚Äôall my daughter is 42 - I know you don‚Äôt like us boomers just try to take a minute and hear me out.  


I want to see Citadel go down. Over the last year, my son in law was invested in a company called Chesapeake Energy. They declared bankruptcy in June 2020.  


About 6 months before they declared bankruptcy, Citadel worked with Chesapeake and their advisors to swap their Unsecured Bonds for new First Lien bonds against Chesapeake‚Äôs assets. All retail investors were shut out of this swap.  


So one day in January 2020 my son in law woke up and saw that ALL of his bonds - his entire life savings was now behind $4.5 billion in new SECURED debt. Before, they were all equal. Now if a bankruptcy occurred, my son in law was at the back of the line.  


This entire series of moves was engineered to exclude the retail investor. It protected institutions. They PURPOSELY EXCLUDED HIM AND OTHERS. They transferred his right to repayment to themselves.  


Before they declared Bankruptcy, Chesapeake negotiated privately with the new Secured Lenders to give them 96% of the new company‚Äôs stock and a 70% discount on new stock.  


My son in law‚Äôs life savings was reduced to 4 cents on the dollar while the institutions were able to get 130% of their money back.  


My son in law was very upset and tried to take a lot of pills on Christmas Eve.  


He‚Äôs okay now though thank God and the doctors.  


I gave him my $100,000 401(k) since I‚Äôve got a pension plan from working for the power company climbing poles for 35 years. He didn‚Äôt have anything left. None of these companies give y‚Äôall kids anything.  


He‚Äôs trying to get back his life savings. He invested in the only thing he knows - he‚Äôs a petroleum engineer, so he bought $CVX, $OXY and $XOM. We‚Äôre hoping they recover so he can get his money back. Everybody thinks oil is evil but natural gas is the bridge from coal to wind and solar.  


What you kids are doing is incredible. I hope you make a difference. They don‚Äôt care about anybody else. Keep running up $GME $AMC $BB $BBBY $NOK - and cost them a lot of money!  


I know y‚Äôall don‚Äôt like us boomers but we love y‚Äôall kids. Don‚Äôt quit trying.

Here is how:

Here is likely the breakdown of outsiders thought of WSB (if they thought of us at all):

1. An average retail investor is conservative, buys ETFs, and doesn't trade with options or leverage. 
2. A $1m portfolio would rarely have more than $50k (5%) in any singular ""speculative"" stock. 
3. We had about 500,000 users, assume $10,000 per user. 
4. This gives WSB $5B in assets under management. 
5. If you assume the average retail investor only invests 5% into any singular play, this would give WSB $250m in buying power for any given play.
6. Assume a finite and largely fragmented ecosystem here where at most any play gathers 10% of our users behind it. 
7. This would make the total buying power of WSB on a single play roughly $25m. 

Assumed buying power: $25m, basically a small family office, not even a blip on the radar. 

Here is the rub. That math was completely broken:

1. YOLO: Our user base is willing to risk 10%, 20%, 50%, 100% of their portfolio on a single bet. Assume the average user will push 25% of their portfolio on a signal play. 
2. This immediately gives us 500% the buying power of average retail traders. We just went from $25m to $125m in buying power. 
3. We use options and leverage. Assume an average of 500% more blended leverage than the average retail investor (mainly based on options more than margins). This takes our buying power from $125m to $750m for a single bet. 
4. Growing Ecosystem: a strong play on WSB is/was not limited to our user base. More people outside of WSB joined in, growing our numbers from 500k to over 5m people. Assuming more fragmentation: a 5% engagement rate on a single play grows our potential dry powder for a single event to $3.75 Billion.

Even $3.75 Billion may be conservative with some institutional investors following WSB

TLDR outside investors likely thought our potential buying power was $25m, in reality, it was off by 15,000% and it was probably $3.75+ Billion"|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185637.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['WSB', 'WSB', 'A', 'WSB', 'B', 'WSB', 'WSB', 'WSB', 'WSB', 'WSB', 'TLDR']|[]

It is the beggining of their end.

The implications of what is happening with GME go far beyond of what is happening with the stock price. So I want to give my point of view of what is happening and why GME investors are doing a favour not only to themselves, but to the whole world, and I am not exagerating.

# Wealthy investors do not need hedge funds anymore

The fact that hedge funds that ~~waste~~ expend billions a year have been beaten by a bunch of redditor trading from home in their pajamas pose an unconfortable question for them: why do wealthy people need hedge funds?

If hedge funds can be beaten so easily, why pay them outrageous fees? See GME investors have put in danger the whole hedge fund business model. That's why they are scared.

# Hedge funds went full retard

For the first time in life hedge funds are reacting to what retail is doing, they are not leading anymore. They decided to go full retard and short even more once the short squeeze started thinking they could easily beat retail, when the trade moved against them, they just cried and change the rules of the game.

The fact that they have lost several times and have no way out, is huge, because it means they cannot bring any value to their investors, again making their business model crumble.

# They have the weaker hand

They tried to use all kind of scary tactics (CNBC spreading misinformation about shorts, depicting wsb as a bunch of people gambling randomly, Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance and many more sites trying to prevent the short squeeze etc), they may have even commited fraud, collusion and market manipulation after what happened on Thursday and Friday. Yet GME investors held the line.

Why? Because they know hedge funds have the weak hand, everyday they are losing money on their shorts, paying interests, while investors just have to hold the stock. There is no hurry in selling, no pressure, and everyday new investors join the party pushing the price higher.

For how many days are they going to keep preventing people from buying?

# They cannot do anything

They may try to close this sub, but it is not possible. Why? Because it would be so obvious that they are doing it because they are losing money that Twitter and YouTube would burn and this would backfire up to the Government.

They may try to prevent retail traders from using leverage products, but that would drain liquidity of options and futures markets and cause potential capital flows into other markets (foreign equity markets, DeFi etc).

If they keep manipulating price and preventing retail from buying, the same applies, capital would flow to other markets so the whole US Financial industry would suffer.

TLDR: HOLD. If you like the stock better buy the stock than weekly calls.

Hedge funds are fucked.

When I found the channel I expected to find a total degenerate. I expected to see some tool sort of like u/WSBGod but with lucky real gains. I was super wrong.

What I found was an extremely smart, soft spoken, humble, and graceful individual.

He found true deep value in a stock and bet on it in a big way. Over the past several months he was welcoming people to challenge him. He was welcoming people to poke holes in his thesis. As GME grew and grew he meme-ed but never gloated. 

This GME situation has now exploded into something that no one (not even DFV) could have foreseen. I can't imagine what is going on for him and his family right now. 

He is a multi-millionaire. People here see him as a deity. Some people here are demanding he speak. Hedge funds probably want to see him ridiculously prosecuted somehow for his DD posts. Some people here are demanding that he announce his next play. I have even seen some people here make serious suggestion that he get into politics. 

I think everyone needs to have mad respect for this guy. With that respect we should all understand that what he decides he wants next for himself might not be what some of us envision. 

The world is honestly his oyster right now and he could go in any direction. Maybe he doesnt want to be in the public eye and wants to be left alone. Maybe he wants to be the next Burry with his own Scion Capital. Maybe he just wants things to stay the same as possible and just do youtube videos from his likely soon to be not rented basement. Whatever his choice is this entire community and the world in general needs to respect it. 

I also see people here writing ""If he is holding. I am holding."" This is fine but people need to understand that he likely will not tell us when he is selling (he shouldn't tell us for MANY reasons). In addition, we need to respect that he IS ALLOWED to sell if he decides to do so.

GME for many has become a venue to personally fuck the system down to your last dollar, but it may not be the same way for him. I personally am holding my position to the bitter end for that reason, but he may not. Others may not. DVF is at the core a true value investor. You will learn this if you watch his videos. Value investors do not buy and hold stocks. I am very interest to see how this ends for him. We all need to respect what one another does with their money. 

From the early days of this forum there have been some major wins that were phony as fuck. Nothing about DFV is phony. He is completely genuine. He is the real Wall Street Bets God.

His name is u/DeepFuckingValue. Let's put respect on that name for what he has done and continue to respect it when he decides how to end it. 

TLDR: In watching hours of DFV content there is no way that you cannot like this guy. He is very smart and very humble. We need to support him should he want privacy. We need to respect him should he exit his position."|2021-01-30 18:56:26.906150|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_185634.csv|StockTicker|['I']|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'MANY', 'IS', 'LOWED', 'GME', 'I', 'DVF', 'I', 'DFV', 'DFV']|['GME', 'GME', 'DD', 'GME']

I'm an eternally optimistic smooth brain, but countless and humbling failures from over confidence have taught me to be better at checking every blindspot. I've made one post about ways we could be left holding bags of GME already, but this scenario was overlooked. That combined with ADHD-fueled deep diving led me to SEC Rule 105. 

What is Rule 105? 

It says that greedy üåàüêª can't short üçå in order to try and drive down the price, and then buy üçå from ü¶ß through a new offering to cover their short. 

If greedy üåàüêª violate it, they pretty much just pay a fine and there have been annual occurrences of violating Rule 105 since 2013. Bare with me, I'm going to try and do math. 

For example, [the hedge fund Millennium paid $638,709](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1DG30L) for 4 violations where 10,000 üçå were shorted each. 

Using 40,000 total üçå, that works out to a fine of $16 for each shorted üçå. 

Although it's very hard to speculate the size of a possible Rule 105 fine for the GME üåàüêª shorts, let's guess based on this one example for the sake of overly simplified argument, because I don't think my brain (or yours) could possibly handle trying to make it more complicated. This also assumes GME is going to do an offering soon, will offer 58M üçå to cover 100% of the shorts, and sell them all to the shorts. I very much doubt that's realistic and GME wouldn't sell them to the üåàüêª that tried to make them go bankrupt, but what if it did happen? 

Greedy üåàüêª always pay less than the current price, so let's say they pay $150/üçå to GME to close the shorts entirely:

$150 x 58M = $8,700,000,000 ($8.7B) to GME 

Now let's say they pay a fine of $16/üçå to pay for their sins to the SEC:

$16 x 58M = $928,000,000 ($928M) to the SEC

$8.7B + $928M = $9.63B 

Less than $10B to get out of the mess they put themselves in. Given that the current risk for the üåàüêª is theoretically unlimited, why wouldn't they do it? 

As I said, I'm about as regarded as they come, this scenario is probably unrealistic and definitely over simplified, but is any of this an actual out for the üåàüêª that could result in all of us holding bags?

I've also yet to find a rule that says different üåàüêª that aren't short can't buy newly offered üçå from GME, and then sell them to the üåàüêª that need to cover their shorts. So maybe that's a possibility? 

TLDR: Given how unrealistic this seems and the fact there are also SEC rules against doing it, my final forecast for GME this week is üéÆüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ. ü§≤üíébois and girls because we like the stock and I'll see you in a galexy unknown.

It has me thinking, what could they possibly try to escape?

1.) Could they liquidate their assets into another company before the debt is due and shutdown capitol before the shorts are due? For example I heard that Toys R Us was robbed by these hedge funds and they forced the borrowed debt back into their hedge fund company. Could they possibly rush a huge debt of melvin and liquidate the debt into one company before the shorts are due? Seems super illegal but based on last week they seem to try anything.

2.) Can they keep affording to pay off the debt indefinitely through higher and higher premiums? I have diamond hands and can hold indefinitely but it got me wondering, if people keep purchasing the calls and push them into the debt contracts, although they run up in value can they just afford to sell new premiums that cover the original debt indefinitely? How are they even selling non-existent funds in the first place??? If that's possible couldn't they keep selling higher and higher amounts of non-existent funds to pay debts?

What else could you guys think of?

If short selling can technically result in an infinite loss, then why can a stock's ""value"" not also be infinite when short sellers get caught with their pants down?

I'm not sure what I wrote that's triggering it to get flagged... but here we go again. 

*I'm not a financial advisor, nor is this financial advice. This is my understanding and perception of PCG based on my experience and research. Go fuck yourself.*


**INTRO**  

Don't worry about jumping on this Monday, this will be a slow mover for a few weeks. Wait to cash out your GME positions after the squeeze climaxes into infinity! Then, put some of those profits aside into a safe 500% return from a utility company. It's always good to diversify.

**TL:DR** \- PCG is weighed down by liabilities from sparking a massive wild fire in 2018 that leveled a Nor Cal town in hours (billions in liabilities, over 100 dead). They are under massive public pressure and fear that another fire will spark due to their equipment coupled with drought conditions, price $55 -> $4 in weeks. Currently $11.40. SIGNED CONTRACT WITH PALANTIR! Going to be the safest utility in the state EOY. Half of the settlement to the fire victims were shares (pretty fk'd up, but it's something), let's make those shares worth $$$$$!

**Why PCG? (Pacific Gas and Electric  a.k.a  PG&E)**

PCG is one of the largest power companies in California, powering almost the entire northern half of the state. They have huge amounts of assets, land, equipment, etc that already justify the current price, but that's irrelevant because the company isn't going bankrupt. They had a MAJOR hit to the company in 2018. High winds and faulty electrical equipment lead to the most deadly wildfire in recent memory. The fire leveled a town within hours due to dry conditions and wind speed. PCG got blamed for the fire and strapped with billions in liabilities.   


Since the fire, PCG has revamped it's safety protocols to prevent future events. But, the last 2 year have shown (as a California resident, with PG&E power) that PCG is very inefficient. The first year (2019) was mostly a shotgun approach... if conditions were dry and an area had high winds, they cut power to EVERY-FUCKING-WHERE. It's a huge pain in the ass, but it's protecting theirs.   


This last year, it got better. I spoke with a few people that work for the city I live in, and they said that they had to contact PCG directly to let them know there was no fire danger within the city limits. So in 2020 during a big wind event, there were fewer, more selective areas turned off. Yay, they're learning... but way too f'king slow.   


**What does the company look like? Let's see the numbers.**  


I'll be honest, they aren't incredible. They are carrying a lot of debt due to burning down a town. But, that doesn't mean the profits are bad, and they are improving! Current revenue has increased year-over-year, while debt has been decreasing and looks to be fully paid off under CURRENT operating. That's not accounting for Palantir streamlining the f'k out of their operation.  


Here is the balance sheet (scroll down for the ""liabilities"" section to see debt): [Balance Sheet](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PCG/financials/annual/balance-sheet)  


All things considered, they are still looking like a solid company, just with a heafty bill due to a random event.   


**Accelerated recovery via PALANTIR!**

Two weeks ago, PCG announced a deal with Palantir to begin using their Foundry platform to help manage their power grid. This. is. HUGE. The biggest thing holding PCG back as a stock right now isn't it's balance sheet, it's the FEAR that another wildfire will come through and add another $10b debt to the company and drive them into bankruptcy.   


This is where Palantir's Foundry comes in. If you haven't had a chance to actually look at Palantir's software, check out the video from Demo Day 3-4 days ago. I tried to link it, but it keeps rejecting my post due to the YouTube link, so look for it on your own (fast forward to 8min for Foundry demo).  


Remember how I said that PCG had to contact the city officials in my local town directly to find out what areas were in danger during high-wind events? That information would be available to a single person, in real time, from every area connected to Palantir. Compiling information like wind speed, identifying damaged equipment, isolating at-risk areas, and making real time decisions. THIS WOULD SAVE PCG MILLIONS. Right now they have to send people out to inspect lines IN PERSON (this takes hundreds of employees HOURS to complete), and they have to call city officials in EVERY CITY and ask them ALL what areas should be blacked-out or kept on depending on risk. Can you imagine the cost of that man-power? The time involved? This took a YEAR to see improvement... But what if that COULD have been done in days, or hours???   


Palantir's Foundry has the ability to completely transform the safety of PCG. This will remove the ""fear"" of potential future fire event, since faulty lines, weather conditions, and overall communication between managers, techs, and field workers are all more connected, faster, and more accurate.   


**Potential**  


PCG's biggest problem has always been their ability to monitor their HUGE coverage area effectively. They are typically delayed to respond to problems, maintenance is usually only AFTER something goes wrong. Basically, the system is just too big and too antiquated.   


This is why the Palantir move is so major. PCG is the FIRST company to use Foundry. THE FUCKING FIRST. Any success from this is going to feed directly into the PLTR profit pool, because PCG becoming safe and efficient would be a GAME CHANGER. They have rode the ""we're you're only fucking choice, deal with it"" ticket too long, and after the 2018 disaster, it kicked them in the ass. This is their moment to actually pivot into a modern company. Value was $55 before the crash in 2018. It's worth at least that after Foundry gets rolling.   


**Final note**  


After the fires, half of the settlement to the fire victims were in shares. Fucking shares. Oh your house burned down? Our bad, here's part of the company... that's worth nothing now. FUCK YOU. I've been pissed the last 2 years about how the whole thing went down, but I get it, they can only do so much without going under in a situation like that. So, let's do our part. Let's push the price of the stock up enough that they can feel a little bit of comfort after losing everything. The company's worth more than it's valued, and far more with the adoption of Foundry. Let's send some tendies to the Paradise victims.   


**Positions**

500 shares PCG & 400 shares PLTR.

As we reach 7m+ Degenerates, there are more and more fud and ""the next whatever"" being touted around to DISTRACT us. There are more and more newly-minted-market-gurus-millionaires telling us Melvin's short position is going to squeeze on Monday Tuesday Thursday. Blah fucking blah.

There's CNBC, Reuters, and other tute-owned or influenced mouthpieces dedicating entire front pages  and taking out paid ads telling us boohoo, they fucking lost, we fucking won already, Melvin closed out, millenial-zoomers are fucking up your longs and the sky is falling. I hate the term ""fake news"" because how often it is wrongly used by the ignorant and because I fucking love the Associated Press, but this is fucking paid-for fake news.

IGNORE ALL THAT NOISE. REMEMBER the MARKET MECHANICS *WE* are EXPLOITING:

1. Hedgies borrowed SHARES of the stock and must return SHARES of the stock
2. The SHARES of the stock is LIMITED and they must BUY IT BACK on the open market when called by the lender
3. We are BUYING and fucking üíéüôå HOLDING all those SHARES. HIGH demand, NO fucking supply. PRICE GOES HIGH since ALL YOUR SHARES ARE BELONG TO US.
4. We will DETERMINE the PRICE when THE SHORT SQUEEZE actually happens, the higher we can HOLD THE LAUNCHPAD FLOOR until then, the HIGHER the SQUEEZE. This is a WAR OF ATTRITION.
5. There IS NO TIME FRAME on WHEN THE SHORT SQUEEZE is going to happen. The lender has discretion on WHEN to call the loans and discretion to MODIFY or even FORGIVE the interest, but they NEED to call it EVENTUALLY. HOWEVER, we can see the trend of credible short data from [Ortex.com](https://Ortex.com), and [S3partners.com](https://S3partners.com), Ortex is affordable and has a free trial, S3's BlackApp less so, the data shows that short % of float is still HIGH for several names in play. This is not to say that the data is infallible or cannot be manipulated, but they provide a better metric than CNBC saying so-and-so closed all their positions and go home.
6. WHEN it happens, THE SHORT SQUEEZE will most likely look like a >**20""\* VERTICALLY ERECT GREEN PENIS** on your DAILY CHART (\*size variance based on the size of your screen) .
7. We are NOT the ones roiling the market-at-large. Our PLAYS are limited to a few TINY-ass names, the ENTIRETY (tens of billions?) of which being only a SMALL FRACTION of one single major SP500 company's market cap (1-2 trillion+).

REMEMBER, THEY EXECUTED a RISKY-AS-FUCK bet with theoretically **INFINITE**  ‚ôæÔ∏è downside (only theoretically if we bought all the shares and set our prices at infinity, i.e. never sell). This puts your weekly FDs of OTM calls to SHAME!!! You can't lose more than the cash you put in, but they can lose their EVERYTHING and then some, and they knowingly went into this. This is NOT our fault, we are NOT doing anything wrong. Our plays are PROVIDING A CHECK AND BALANCE to UNCHECKED hedgefund fuckers that have been fucking us and the companies we love up the ass for DECADES, often ILLEGALLY -- NAKED SHORTS OVER 140% FLOAT (short selling with IMAGINARY shares) -- What in the literal fuck?.

As for various market selloffs last week, they could be folks taking profits after a record year, they could be scared folks who don't understand the situation, they could have just wanted another box of fleshlights, and/or they could also be the hedgies dumping and leveraging their longs to double down, triple down, quadruple down, because they think they can, or they have no choice, but to TRY to OUTLAST US. If they are already going to lose EVERYTHING (by covering at current prices), then what's another few fucking billion to push down the price and hope that a bunch of autistic plebs give up, get bored, or get DISTRACTED? We can't prove this, but their actions, PAID ads, and shill mouthpieces, all speak volumes.

Billionaire fund managers are stubborn, why would they openly admit to loss to a bunch of retards on Reddit if there was nothing to gain? To them, a bigger fund amount is just a new high score. Their lives don't change, they might buy another yacht. So ask yourself, would a monarch of yore, decked in all their splendor and glory, yield to a mere peasant? No.

Most of us are just common plebs working the daily grind, many of us don't even have the daily grind right now due to the pandemic. Our war chests are meager, but combined, together, we have a CHANCE. Billionaire Nick Hanauer wrote an article to his fellow billionaires that [THE PITCHFORKS ARE COMING](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/the-pitchforks-are-coming-for-us-plutocrats-108014), well this is what that looks like in the market, our shares are our pitchforks, we are not breaking the law, we are not invading your homes, we are not beheading the aristocracy. We are just giving you a taste of your own medicine and playing by the rules of a FREE MARKET in a government that protects FREE SPEECH.

Do NOT let them distract you! Do not feel bad about what we are doing or the dollar amount in your brokerage account. For once we are playing THEIR game and have a chance of actually winning.

First, I want to thank DFV u/deepfuckingvalue for showing me the way and leading us to the next galaxy!  **üöÄüöÄüöÄ...üíé‚úãonly** 

My main thought is this, don't become like the billionaires and multimillionaires of this country and be passive in the community and hoard our money like we're some kinda greedy dragons.

I grew up poor, very poor. So poor that when I was a kid my mom cleaned hotels and got to stay in one because we were homeless when I was 4. I had to survive eating butter, straight butter, for a week, when we ran out of food when I was 13. I've had fears of becoming homeless since then.

One day I was hit head on by a semi truck. I died for a few minutes on the operating table. I got a settlement, started to invest, and made it to $700K in 1 year with a $100K nut. I know, that's nothing like DFV, and I'm nothing compared to him. Because I lost it all.

I was almost a millionaire at 24, but I lost it all by buying down and panic selling later. Remember this next week, Don't Panic. Stay calm. Enjoy the ride. We will see a huge dip come Monday. That's when we ride! Buy the dip, and HOLD!

So back to my main point. Doing kind things to random people who are strangers and friends. That's my goal, besides strong personal financial security. But I don't need to make more than $100K a year to live a great life. I don't. But that doesn't mean I don't want to make millions. Mainly, I would love to make millions like DFV so I could do random acts of kindness and be active about it. Not leave it up to some bullshit charity. I don't know about you guys, but regardless of how big you make it, I hope you consider not become like these selfish billionaires who are hoarding money like it will buy them a golden ticket into heaven.

Unless... That's how it works and nobody has told us?

Kodak originally skyrocketed when news of a government $765m loan was announced to kick start them into becoming a pharmaceutical company during the midst of the pandemic. Yes, yes, I know.. Kodak seems like the company trying to jump on the bandwagon.. a cryptocurrency in 2017, and now pharma in 2020? Anyway, it retraced most of its gains when the SEC opened up an investigation on wrongdoing related to expected insider trading.  

 \-About a month and a half ago, the conclusion was made that there was no wrongdoing related to insider trading, the loan, etc. Now, that doesn‚Äôt mean it will still go through, but it certainly doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt. Kodak has made several announcements they will be getting into Pharma whether or not the loan goes through. With covid still looming, I don‚Äôt see what would have changed regarding the loan and with the original announcement being mid last year, an update MUST be coming regarding Kodak & pharma. 

 \-The market cap is only 700 million dollars. (Micro cap) This is minuscule, it‚Äôs less than the amount of money the government was going to give them, and is why Kodak went up so much when it was announced -Its literally more than the company was even worth! Market cap is important because it means Kodak has the potential to increase heavily over its current share price of \~$9.60. The higher the market cap, the more money required for a stock price to increase. For example, People are buying Nokia which already has a 30 billion market cap- that‚Äôs not going anywhere significant with nothing significant happening presently. 

 \-Relatively high short interest of 25.5% as of last week. This could spark a huge run. If price gets out of control, it would force shorts to cover. It‚Äôs obviously not one of the very top shorted companies, but it‚Äôs up there and with explosive price action Kodak is known to have, shorts seem to probably expect this by now. Once it breaks the current resistance it may fly catching the shorts off guard. 

 \-Huge bullish flag/pennant technical setup is primed to breakout. Check the longer term chart.  üöÄ üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ

Media and the Reddit hivemind created this whole narrative that Reddit is responsible for squeezing Citadel and co when in reality WSB is just a pawn for the other hedge funds to kill Citadel. Everyone is out here playing 4D chess, look how much profit some of these hedge funds made going long on Gamestop while killing their rival, Citadel.

&#x200B;

There are  3 outcomes from this mess:

1. Citadel and co gets a slap on the wrist and nothing happens. (highly doubt this will happen due to the major media coverage on this and the whole narrative on how this is a ""david vs goliath story"")
2. Citadel and co goes bankrupt and fucked in the ass by SEC. If and when Citadel goes bankrupt, all the brokers are now liable to pay the winners, then the banks are liable, and so on... This will have a domino effect on the broader market, considering Citadel is quite big. This is literally a ticking time bomb waiting to explode, just look at the current VIX. (probably might happen if no one bails them out)
3. The rival hedge funds that are long on Gamestop takes profit and flash crash GME so that Citadel can get out of their short while everyone wearing a suit and tie makes profit off this. (highly doubt this will happen, this would actually the biggest 5D chess move)

&#x200B;

VIX also popped up on Wednesday in response to the whole Gamestop thing. This could very well be the catalyst that kills the bubble when this is all over.

IF TOO MUCH WORDS IS **NOT** YOUR STYLE AND LITTLE WORD DO TRICK **TLDR IS BELOW** üëáüèºüöÄ

&nbsp;

# NIO

###### Why NIO?:

- NIO had an **astronomically good** 2020 and really solidified themselves as a legitimate EV company in a fast growing sector. EVs are the literal future but NIO isn't just EVs üòâ More on that later. But for now, EVs are the MOST popular stocks to buy and hold and this will provide a **TON** of stability for NIO and make it a definite high growth stock. **THIS IS LIKE IF YOU COULD BUY TESLA FOR 60 DOLLARS!!!** Don't miss out, this stock has about the distance between the earth and fucking **MARS** left in terms of growth. But you must be asking, why?

- Why: NIO is entering the EV space in China **AND** Europe, in fact it will be the leading EV company in China, and this is huge for a multitude of reasons. 

 - China is the biggest vehicle market in the world right now.
 &nbsp;
 - It will be a big player in China's pivot into lowering emissions and focus on going green.
&nbsp;
 - China loves Luxury vehicles and NIO vehicles are the _definition_ of [luxury](https://i.imgur.com/s5iuFKh.jpg) when it comes to EV's right now especially their new vehicle unveiled during NIO day earlier this January the ET7.
&nbsp;
 - **NIO IS NOT TRYING TO REPLACE TESLA, NIO IS ESTABLISHING ITSELF AS IT'S OWN BRAND** and I will go more indepth into why NIO is developing itself into MORE than just an EV company later.

&nbsp;

###### Who Matters:

- NIO's CEO **WILLIAM LI** is a literal genius. Dubbed the Elon fucking Musk of China. He has the drive and the motivation to launch this company to the fucking MOON üöÄüåô.

- NIO's Head of AI **Dr. Ren Shaoqing**. This guy is also quite literally a genius. He is the top researcher for NIO's autonomous driving software and this is great news for NIO's SaaS (Software as a Service) and will generate NIO a *TON* of revenue.

As far as background on the company these guys give the company an insanely bullish outlook but that's just the beginning.


&nbsp;

###### Why Now?:

- The closest upcoming catalysts for NIO are **January Deliveries**. (Will be announced sometime during the first week of February) and earnings **March 9th**. These dates are super important and will be **crucial** in NIO's upcoming breakout so keep these in mind! üöÄ

- Deliveries and Earnings are so **crucial** because NIO has consistently been on the uptrend and consistently smashing every projection. NIO will _absolutely_ beat expectations as usual and **LI BIN** will not let you down.

- **THESE EVENTS ALONE COULD TRIGGER THE NEXT BULL RUN FOR NIO TO MARS** üöÄüåô. The company is super underrated right now and getting in before the explosion that these catalysts could cause could be one of the most solid plays you ever make. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE üöÄüöÄüöÄ

- NIO's Price Target has been consistently raised over the past few weeks of NIO consolidating.

- NIO had an **extremely** successful NIO day unveiling their plans for advancing NIO into the future and revealing their new [Luxury](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ppSFaFQHAsY/X_tJH_-d4JI/AAAAAAAAQgk/lZ5iMk3_4Ws_1XFjog51w-r0lfos4D6OQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1920/nio-et7%2B%25281%2529.jpg) [Electric](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qD-V4W4K4k4/X_tJ1jtmPpI/AAAAAAAAQg4/7Gr4OSMhq2IbWo9FPLLM6BDT8laWO740wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1920/nio-et7-interior.jpg) [Sedan](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qD-V4W4K4k4/X_tJ1jtmPpI/AAAAAAAAQg4/7Gr4OSMhq2IbWo9FPLLM6BDT8laWO740wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1920/nio-et7-interior.jpg) the **ET7**, and the [NVIDIA](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nio-partners-with-nvidia-to-develop-a-new-generation-of-automated-driving-electric-vehicles) Drive Orin chips for their AI Driving NVIDIA-powered supercomputer named **ADAM**. There is even more tech they are bringing soon such as better batteries, better autonomous driving tech, better cameras and sensors for detection while driving on the road, BaaS (Battery as a service), SaaS (Software as a service), and their battery swap stations that are quick and easy to use and are located all over China.

- There was so much hype over the ET7 in china that the NIO app **CRASHED** from getting too many preorders. üöÄ

- **NEW** [Factory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/kxf8e7/chinese_media_picking_it_up_new_factory/) built in China and [Europe](https://i.redd.it/8eq9eqb8hja61.jpg) expansion is right around the corner.

- NIO is not in the spotlight and is in what some would call the ***GOLDEN DIP***. NIO is dipped off of lack of news and hype in other stocks making it the absolute *PRIME* to buy calls on sale and **HOLD** until we land on **MARS** making this the perfect buying opportunity.

&nbsp;

###### What makes NIO not *just* an EV company?:

- NIO is differentiating itself from other EV companies by introducing **NIO Life** into NIO's growth as not only an EV company but a **BRAND**.

- NIO in China has a near cult-like following where customers can indulge themselves in the NIO culture. They can earn points by driving their NIO vehicle and contributing to the green movement then use those earned points to buy NIO brand products. You can read more about it [here](https://www.nio.com/nio-life). It is really interesting and if it seems corny to you, well it is! But the truth is the typical person loves this kind of brand building and it **really works**.

- To build on this NIO has **NIO Houses** which are recreational buildings in public for NIO users to interact with each other, read, study, host speeches, look at new car models, play music, a kids room and most importantly a **NIO Cafe**. You can read more about it [here](https://www.nio.com/nio-house).

- NIO offers special services to it's customers that I will briefly cover such as their special Power Home at home charging stations, Power map locating nearest battery swap/charging stations for you, quick battery swap stations, and [Free Lifetime Roadside Assistance](https://www.nio.com/nio-service). 

**ALL OF THESE THINGS TOGETHER MAKE NIO AN INSANELY FUCKING SOLID COMPANY AND AS CORNY AS SOME OF THE THINGS MAY SEEM THIS IS HOW THEY ARE BUILDING A STRONG AND LOYAL CUSTOMER BASE**. People are already falling in love with NIO in China and there is somewhat of a small cult-like following building itself around NIO.


&nbsp;

###### Why NIO will be very profitable very fast:

- NIO is building a strong customer base due to reasons mentioned above and most of all they are offering their BaaS, SaaS, and [0 down payment](https://cnevpost.com/2021/01/21/nio-allows-customers-to-buy-cars-with-0-down-payment/) to their customers now as well as the release of their new EV Luxury Sedan which will cause a **huge** boost in sales.

- NIO's [BaaS](https://www.nio.com/nio-power) plan is efficient and consumer friendly as well as being unique to NIO. They work heavily in NIO's favor by getting the customer to sign up for a subscription service to receive the newest batteries and the battery replacement is easy and fast. NIO's BaaS will generate a **solid** revenue stream for NIO. NIO's battery swap stations are very quick getting a full battery swap done in **THREE MINUTES** and with NIO's newest OS 2.9.0 the car will enter the battery swap station itself, have parking assist, and allows [summoning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QguVzh8q3M&feature=emb_title). 

- NIO's expansion into the green space in Europe will be another profitable revenue stream for NIO and further its brand and recognition in the EV space.

&nbsp;

# Closing thoughts and Addressing possible concerns:

- I want to close this out by saying I am in no way a china shill I just see a value play and am here to share my DD with the rest of you.

- I urge you all to do your own DD and find reasons for yourself on why to invest in NIO and why it is a strong play this year. My DD is simply my opinion that I believe in.

- My price target for NIO EOY is *minimum* 200+, I am very bullish on NIO and I feel the upcoming catalysts will be what launches NIO into the stratosphere üöÄüåå.

- For those that are curious why NIO is trading flat and didn't read too much above it's because NIO has had no *recent* news and is in what I consider to be the *golden dip*. The significant news is coming up soon and it's better to buy **before** the launch while it is in its current consolidation state. 

- Shorter term PT is **at least** 80 by mid March.

&nbsp;

# TLDR;

NIO is a strong upcoming EV company with a variety of unique ideas that differentiate it from the typical EV company. NIO's BaaS, SaaS, Battery Swap Stations, NIO Life, NIO House, and it's sleek looking new [electric sedan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySguV2TwE6w) the **ET7** along with upcoming deliveries announcement the first week February and earnings this March are just enough reasons to üöÄ NIO ‚û° THE üåô.

(See [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6n4ay/the_biggest_risk_we_face_and_why_its_nothing_to/) for my last missive to the community).

I want to check in because I‚Äôve been getting confirmation privately that the hedge funds are hurting while publicly the news articles are saying they‚Äôre doing fine--my confidence in WSB‚Äôs power to upend the market with its collective power has gotten stronger.

That‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm writing now, though. I want to show you how the misinformation train keeps coming. Don‚Äôt get on.

First, here‚Äôs the funniest example of the media getting shit wrong I‚Äôve seen in a while: on the [Bloomberg podcast The Tape](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmJsb29tYmVyZy5mbS9CTE0yMjM2OTYwNDk1/episode/YTgzN2RkYzItNjBkYy0xMWViLTgzMzItMWJmNDg4Nzk1MGNm?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwjwgpOM8sTuAhWTzTgGHbRDDVYQjrkEegQIDRAL&ep=6) on January 28, Kathy Burton, the hedge fund reporter for Bloomberg, discusses her piece on the trend dismissively by calling WSB a bunch of ‚ÄúReddit bros‚Äù and saying WSB targeted several stocks Melvin Capital had shorted (not true--GME was the only target, and it was targeted because of its overall SI, not because of Melvin or its founder).

That‚Äôs not the worst part. The worst part is Burton repeatedly calls GME ‚ÄúGameshop‚Äù (I‚Äôm not kidding, go to 26:40 in the podcast). If you‚Äôre going to report on a company, maybe get the company name right, k Kathy?

Now look at this post: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/blackrock-s-hildebrand-calls-short-squeeze-mania-some-nonsense. It‚Äôs fucking horseshit.

First, BlackRock and JPMorgan dismiss the trend as something that will come and go (they wish) and they blame the Federal Reserve (‚ÄúIt is not surprising when you think about how much liquidity is in the system, how much policy has fueled asset prices in recent weeks and months‚Äù is what Hildebrand, Vice Chairman of Blackrock said).

Now, Blackrock is a former client of mine, and I can say this because they‚Äôre no longer a client and I haven‚Äôt worked with them for years. **One of the worst stock picks and theses behind that stock pick I ever saw was from a portfolio manager at Blackrock who managed many billions of dollars**. Not everyone at Blackrock is bad (I‚Äôve met some very smart people there), but not everyone is good. So even if someone at Blackrock dismisses GME in good faith, it doesn‚Äôt mean shit. But Hildebrand is talking in bad faith, clearly, because she wants higher interest rates so financial firms can lend money at higher rates. It‚Äôs very likely self-serving dishonesty.

Then there‚Äôs the fact that what he said isn‚Äôt even true. Money velocity remains at record low levels, indicating liquidity IN THE REAL ECONOMY is not high (unsurprising since QE is a very ineffective means of getting money into the hands of ordinary people--which is not the Fed‚Äôs fault, as that‚Äôs not really their job).

Plus, asset prices aren‚Äôt showing a bubbly tendency at all. Note how Hildebrand doesn‚Äôt address the fact that the Nasdaq 100 went down over 4% last week--hardly the sign of a stock market bubble. He‚Äôs full of shit.

That isn‚Äôt the worst part of this story.

Perhaps the most egregious example of how Wall Street is trying to spin this in their favor is Anne Richards, Fidelity International CEO, who said in an interview that the GME situation shows why there should be LESS transparency for shorting stocks. I‚Äôm quoting Bloomberg:

>‚ÄúThe thing that they could do very very quickly is remove the transparency on where the big shorts are, because that seems to be the trigger,‚Äù Richards said. ‚ÄúBut then of course that takes away from that market transparency which everybody wanted to put in place after the financial crisis.‚Äù

She does NOT suggest that there should be MORE market transparency so that investors know how much a hedge fund shorts a stock and when it shorts, so that big shorts can‚Äôt accumulate and trigger an event like $GME mooning--no, the market needs LESS transparency, she says, so that retail investors can‚Äôt squeeze hedge funds.

This is obvious bullshit, and the fact that it went unchallenged on Bloomberg is a testament to how shoddy their journalism really is. Bloomberg has been the place that gave massive platforms to hucksters like Dennis Gartman, a newsletter writer who was a punchline on Wall Street--we would always say he‚Äôs the best contrarian indicator on the market, just do the opposite of what he does. Gartmen quit his newsletter in 2019, which cost thousands of dollars to subscribe to annually, after getting regular interviews on Bloomberg where he was treated as an expert for the unknowing public despite his appalling track record and constant failures.

Now Bloomberg is giving a platform to WS players who are trying to spin the story to deregulate the industry. Absolutely fucking unreal.

Or, well, it isn‚Äôt, really. I have seen this happen in my decade in the industry. I have seen mainstream news articles on reports I‚Äôve written that get those reports exactly wrong. I remember one report in particular where the headline was ambiguous, but the report was very clearly positive on the stock for reason X. The news report from one outlet (possibly Bloomberg) said something like ‚ÄúAnalyst bearish on stock for reason Opposite-of-X‚Äù. It was really funny, and since correcting the record wasn‚Äôt good for my employer‚Äôs business, we didn‚Äôt bother to. That‚Äôs just one of many examples of fuckery I have from the financial press, so this misinformation garbage does not surprise me one bit.

Tldr; read the whole post you lazy fuck. But if you can‚Äôt read, here‚Äôs the deal: the financial press‚Äôs activist misinformation campaign is getting more and more transparent."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001638.csv|StockTicker|['$GME']|['GME']|['I', 'I', 'WSB', 'WSB', 'GME', 'SI', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'IN', 'THE', 'REAL', 'ONOMY', 'QE', 'CEO', 'GME', 'LESS', 'NOT', 'MORE', '$GME', 'LESS', 'WS', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'X', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Not trying to be a negative nancy here, I'm genuinely curious.  In thinking about the ways that GME may or may not play out next week, a thought struck me and I'd like some input that may dictate how long I (and maybe others, if other people have purchased this stock...) should hold for.

Say they started covering their $15 shorts at $100, then re-bought shorts at $150, then $200, etc, then covered their $150 shorts and re-bought shorts at $300.  It could still very-well be a 126% short interest, just that the shorts are now at $300.

This would probably mean that they would have a lot less interest to pay to hold the shorts, and may have a longer lifeline than any single investor who likes $GME would want to hold on to their shares for.

Can you offer any insight?üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ"|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001649.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['GME', 'I', '$GME']|['GME', 'GME']

Now, if I may, there are some lessons to be learned here. Number one is that while this community is generally very optimistic about the meme stock rockets, when the stakes become at all real, so do predictions. This dataset is notably deviant from the degenerate circlejerks you normally come across on WSB. That said... if these numbers can be interpreted as the **real** sentiment of WSB, then we succeeded far beyond our expectations. **Even in the face of the unprecedented market manipulation and downward pressure of the last 2 days, only 8 people out of over 100 actually predicted above the correct price of $325.** The last couple days have been frustrating, but take this as evidence that we are succeeding.

As far as I know the fight's still on. The short's not squeezed and the gains not won.

Robinhood(RH) - Fuck these guys

[Cash APP](https://cash.app/app/XHBWJGN) \- Super quick and easy to use. It just pulls from your bank, don't really need to deposit and wait so its fast. Limited in what you can do. Can really just sell and buy at market price.

[Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/corporate-portal/)\- From my understanding they are on our side. Full fledged platform.

However, pretty easy to use and teeter towards the side of us monkieees.

[TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/home.page) \- From my understanding, they are also on the side of the retard because they invested like a retard themselves.

I think the quickest two to get approved and start trading are CASHAPP and WEBULL. However, they all give their own bonusses for signing up and shit.

Fell free to add to this list and I will edit the post as information arises - If you apply now then by mid week all the newcomers can help us hold the line or invest whatever they think is dope - this is by no means investing advice. I am fucking stupid at this shit.

The company surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, with an average of 25.01%.


In the to-be-reported quarter, revenues from the cloud segment are expected to have increased from a year ago, backed by growth in the number of paying customers and higher-than-usual spending by them, reflecting increased usage of services.


The company‚Äôs Mobile Monthly Active Users improved sequentially in fiscal second-quarter 2021, a trend that most likely continued in the fiscal third quarter. This is because of increased adoption of mobile devices by consumers as the primary method of accessing Alibaba‚Äôs platforms.

Now I see what's happening with Game and want to buy a share or two and hopefully punish the scum that we're rewards in 2008 for destroying so much, almost 30 and can't afford my own rent, cr insurance, health insurance etc all at once, hence living with family again... :(

Anyway I played with arobinhood around 2017 it was easy, free and company seemed great eventually cashed out breaking even after playing around and not knowing wtf I was doing.

This week tried to log into my account and can't get in. Repeatded support messages sent, they are not sending a sms code to my phone and then they pulled that stock restriction fuck this company.

The main post has 200\~ gilds, and has a post history of two, less than one sentence posts from 8 months ago before making the most popular ag post.

One account started posting for the first time in 9 years to promote silver.

Ryan & the board are likely aware of the subreddit, and there's a lot of attention on it, so maybe in addition to highlighting how much WE LIKE THE STOCK we could also cold pitch some growth opportunities.

I really love the new CEO and board changes, as a Gamestop customer in my youth I even applied to it as my second job. I applied as a store manager, without any managing experience, at 16, because I loved games. I filled out the application and stapled a second, lined notebook paper to the application, which was my ""why do you want to work here"" answer. It was a really long passionate diatribe about my Counterstrike skills developing our clan both during tournaments as well as while we're not gaming by hosting LAN parties and activities. I was serious and was crushed I didn't get a callback. I worked in IS/IT for a few years and moved on. I work in tech now and I have an MBA, and oddly before this week I would never thought to pitch to Gamestop, but I love the idea of pitching Gamestop.

Why? Gamestop was a portal to reach totally random kids who loved everything I did. We used to all harass our parents to take us to two places: local LAN party joints or Gamestop. We didn't have any money, it was essentially a dumping ground for poor kids, but we'd be respectful of both businesses. Yeah you could meet strangers online, but that's weird (or weirder now than it was then) and I am STILL friends with people I met at LAN parties and Gamestop.

There's a lot of potential for physical retail spaces and there's time during Covid19 to transform those before we reopen this bitch with a brand new $20B Gamestop in 2021/2022.

Could we remake LAN parties, arcades, all the grimey old 80's spaces that slowly were demolished through the late 90's? The lifeblood of America? Yes we brought gaming ""home,"" and sold more consumer devices, but we lost the in-person human experience. Can we write Gamestop into Stranger Things and every other TV/movie coming out in the next two years to boost the hype train? Yes.

What if the game/console sales went the Chewy model (with local pickup if shipping to a residence isn't possible) and the new albeit small retail space was used for game, console, but also STEM/educational programming, bring Black Girls Code in and be inclusive, gamers aren't all blond white boys. My nieces and nephews don't want, despite all my efforts, to play just Warhammer 40k as the Trukk Boyz. My favorite niece does and growls ""WAAAGHHHHH"" but her sister plays Minecraft.

My friends who are parents, even if they were or are gamers and nerds, are confused about what content is safe for their kids these days. When Among Us came out my sister asked if it was safe for kids.. and I didn't know to be honest. We grew up on Gamestop.. why not have it shepherd the next generation of entertainment through diverse programming and informing parents. Subscribe to Gamestop basic for a newsletter about family friendly games and activities you can play with multiple generations, kids and parents, just kids, just parents, etc. Hype games like Jackbox, not just Cyberpunk.

You know what everyone pitches and hates pitching? Social media. Social media got too broad, it needs some structure, can we revisit a cross between GameSpy and ICQ that lets you instantly play games with friends, coworkers, family, your kids.. from anywhere? Maybe its an app, maybe its an API, maybe its tied to a platform like Apple messaging but maybe its a PWA and goes anywhere. You can game, but you can also reflect your life and experiences like Instagram (without the privacy/snooping/hate speech) so people can share and grow. Gamestop would regulate the shit out of content with super supportive moderation and a heavy fucking hand.

Similarly to Gamestop's business partner Microsoft's Xbox, they can help censor and report malicious or offensive content and hate speech in online experiences. That crap has no place. Instead of pitching mountain dew and doritos, jolt cola, top ramen like at LAN parties, sell some nutritious and not too-marked-up food staples because parents will just leave their kids there for a while.

While the parents are there, hook them into gaming with their kids, and being gaming mentors for their kids' friends and other folks. Gaming mentors can be a badge, old nerds love that shit, or offer discounts to game subscriptions and services. Mentor/GM/advise parents for X hours and get game exclusives. Teach them that grandma and grandpa like games, that we can all bond through entertainment.

Gamestop used to be the linchpin, similarly to GameSpy for finding friends playing games, or ICQ being the communicator, whatever. Game studios threw them away, but lost their ability to talk to their customers. Keep Gamestop retail stores as these mini arcades, basically a fun version of the Apple store, where yeah, you can buy a console and Nintendo minifigs or whatever.. but a kid can use their Gamestop save card and tap into their last progress with some puzzle fighter, or tap in to get an exclusive skin for Minecraft by solving some STEM puzzles, whatever. Don't like retail stores? Great! Get rid of them- we're in an age where you can host wide user research panels through Zoom, Teams, whatever.

Game studios and hardware/console makers can tap into their raw customer base here. Transparently advertise paid panel sessions where actual kids who play the game can just call Blizzard a bag of fucking dicks and Blizzard will pay to hear it. Good developers are desperate to hear feedback, good studios will flock to it, and Gamestop employees are brilliant, they can easily crosstrain as user research panelists/experts. Shit, introduce that into the transaction and sell game studios anonymized customer reports. At checkout or if customers ask about products and services, write it into the process of sales advisement (not pushing games though!) on collecting feedback and make SURE the customer understands their feedback to employees will be used to help shape games- but its anonymized, no user data collected.

With all this opportunity also comes trust... put trust #1. Microsoft with Satya was all like ""play well with others"" and ""truuuust bitches."" There's been gaps sure, but them and Apple under Cook are trying (and should) lock advertisers out of their ecosystems. Nobody should be reading your kids' gaming or reading habits, but the parents. Fuck Facebook, fuck Robinhood, etc.

Now this is a low effort elevator pitch but if $GME or any of their partners, potential partners, want to make a play, I'll sign up to write a pitch deck, a one pager, whatever. I'm an MBA in tech, former Gamestop customer, raised in computers.. but I'm also not a gamer. I mostly garden and do outdoor shit, but I still love some wholesome entertainment. Seeing AOC stream Among Us on Twitch with fellow congresswomen blew my fucking mind. Let's fucking do this! Sincerely, *diamond hands*.

PS.. grow from within, Gamestop employees are, I'm sure, itching to get in on ground floor growth. Having a resource like that to tap for leadership opportunities is huge.

PPS.. Sherrilyn Ifill wrote a fucking beautiful report for Starbucks on how to engage communities after Starbucks shit the bed for the .. fourth time or whatever and fucking arrested their own customers for buying coffee while being Black. You want the literal business plan read ""[Toward a Vision for Racial Equity & Inclusion at Starbucks: Review and Recommendations](https://www.demos.org/research/toward-vision-racial-equity-inclusion-starbucks-review-and-recommendations)"" and also buy her books, and watch every recorded lecture of hers you can find online, then contract her & her network to tailor this FOR GAMESTOP. Gamestop was, and is about community- diverse and inclusive community, and racial equity & inclusion should be #1.

Don't let yourselves be consumed by something so powerful though. As beautiful as the movement is, there is more to the originations of /Wallstreetbets. 

Short Stock opportunities are not the focus of market opportunities.

Theta Gang is here, was here, and is here to stay. 

Owning 100 Shares in a company is a powerful thing. Understanding when to buy the dip, sell a covered call, and then a cash covered put can be more than useful and valuable to building a GME gains style portfolio over a period of time that is not 1 week. 

Autistic, Built prototype airplanes, Run CnC Machines and many other things.

Our IQ may not be triple digit, but our bank accounts will be larger than the stratosphere. There is no hate, but nothing but love. We grew up on the internet, we love the internet. 

There is more to life than GME, but it is THE MOST POWERFUL movement that grew a population 3x in a week and changed lives. Love, and prepare to use the morals, and steel nuts developed here to increase your gains for years to come.

I'm confident this will get downvoted to hell, but fuck it.

Early GME holders (people who bought <$50 or so), you can keep walking. You're all most likely safe and will profit from your holdings and trades.

People who're buying GME at current levels, maybe I'll be completely wrong and you'll make a million and cash out at the top and lose nothing... or maybe, I'll be right and it will be loss porn galore for days. I'm leaning towards the second.

**Here's why,**

GME is trading at a ridiculous premium, short squeeze or not, gamma squeeze or not. If you're buying in now, you might see a few days, or even a few weeks worth of green that will be life-changing... but most of you will end up losing to an enemy you don't even think you're playing against. I'll explain this in a bit.

Right now, the general public and especially WSB consensus is that GME is going to keep squeezing because of 100%+ short interest, and that's a fundamentally valid reason, but those who are buying these GME shares, where do you think they're coming from? Here's a hint.

Initially, Melvin and Shitron were the primary shorters. They shorted the stock around $10 or so, thus making their max profit $10/share if GME had gone bankrupt. But as you keep squeezing higher, and even worse, as you keep buying at higher prices... Though Melvin and Shitron would be forced to close positions with hefty losses (I say would because I don't know for a fact that they already have despite what CNBC says), many other hedge funds would've opened new ones. Now, why the fuck would they do that? Simple, you gave them an opportunity to short a stock that was worth $10 a few months back, and is now 30x that... raising potential returns by at least 30x. Of course, the stock doesn't even have to go back to $10, even at $50 or $100 newly opened shorts would see sizable returns, and the only people who get truly hurt will be the ones who longed at these ridiculous levels.

Think about it., who do you think keeps lending out more shares to the retail investor? New hedge funds who previously had no skin in the game, or had a very small position at best!!! You don't think you're playing against them, but you are. The energy and focus seem so concentrated on Melvin and the gang that you don't even realize there are vultures waiting for a complete bloodbath.

Eventually, time will come when profit-seekers (with long positions) will begin entering the market, or when retail investors would've exhausted their capital and the price will come tumbling down faster than gravity taking hold of vulture shit falling from the sky. It will be a matter of a few thousand shares entering and the domino effect will bring it all down in a matter of days, maybe even hours.

The fuck am I trying to say? Well, I'm not advocating for a liquidation here, and neither am I telling you to stop buying. That decision is yours to make with the information you gather. All I'm saying is look around for more enemies as prices keep skyrocketing. You, the retail investor, are walking through the valley of beasts with every intention to make the rich bastards pay, but just know, there are a lot more of them gathering around this battle with each $ GME goes up... and not a single one of them stands agnostic, they've all got a bet open and it's most likely against you at these levels. This is becoming as much an opportunity of a lifetime on the short side, as it was on the long side when the stock was in single digits.

Hope you all have a great weekend and do well in Feb."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001742.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'WSB', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'CNBC', 'I', 'I', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

We're ""blowing up a bubble"" that will lead to a market crash. ""So many people are going to be left holding the bag.""

I guess none of this applied in 2007-2009 when millions of Americans were left holding the bag that Wall Street left them after gambling with synthetic securities and then taking those synthetic securities and packaging them into NEW synthetic securities ad infinitum until the entire financial system was quite literally about to disintegrate.

I guess none of that applies to the entirety of 2020 either. I guess the Fed literally printing infinite money taking the stock market to all time highs as we are in the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression has not contributed to a bubble whatsoever. I guess Jeff Bezos truly deserves to have 200 billion dollars as tens of millions of Americans can't pay rent or feed their families. After all, the market is forward thinking! All of this is completely natural.

But uh oh! It seems as though CNBC has finally found the true culprit for the impending financial crisis! It's those gosh darn redditors! Through complex market manipulation (aka ""buying a stock"") we are now responsible for whatever is to come next. We are solely responsible for the economic hardship brought on by a stock market crash.

It's not the multi-billion dollar hedge funds and investment banks illegally gambling with synthetic securities. It's not because a stock can somehow be shorted around to the point that it has more shares shorted than outstanding. It's not because if one fucking hedge fund loses solvency then somehow the entire market crashes. It's not because these mega-billionaires are so overleveraged that one measly short squeeze can cause a financial collapse.

No, it's because of the fucking redditors."|2021-01-30 20:19:43.434615|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_201944.csv|StockTicker|['ESTOP', 'HANGE', 'THE', 'CKING']|[]|['I', 'NEW', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'CNBC']|[]

First off i have absolutley have no financial experience what so ever, hell i only joined WSB this week and i have already have fallen in love with this community.

So we all know what might happen if the true squeeze occurs and what will happen after it, my question would be: wouldn't it be a smart idea to reinvest some if the gains into GME in the post squeeze super dip that i would imagine is coming?

From what i have learned doing some DD on this subreddit and its this:

*  Gamestop was doing ok, not great, before covid. 
* The company got some investment from Ryan Cohen who even was given a board seat as well as 2 friends from Chewy. They plan to move the company away from brick and mortar stores and turn Gamestop into an online store like steam i guess. 
* There is a new console generation where the supply is so low that PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING OVER PS5s at stores.
* All the media attention has brought Gamestop to the forefront of almost everyones mind even those who dont play video games in the US  and has for most part for most people put the company in an extremely positive light as the underdog.

As far as ive heard the rumor is Gamestop had serious issues raising captial due to number of reasons (mostly being over shorted and covid hiting a b&m store i bet) but now due to the short squeeze and it taking over every tv in the world. I wouldnt be surprised if more investors came in to help Gamestop after the dust settles. 

My thoughts would be after short squeeze happened those of us who sell $GME it would be a smart move to rebuy $GME and üíéüëê once again.

Ill say it again i have NO FINANCIAL EXPERIENCE and this is nothing more than an educated guess.

Love to hear the opinions of it who at least have some wrinkles in their smooth brains

While I'm wanting to hold as much as everyone else, I also want my tendies like everyone else does. I was wondering if someone in here who is smarter than me can provide an actual TA or DD of the situation with a realistic dollar amount for the peak, how long it may be that high, when it might moon, etc. 

I get that this is a casino. I get that it's a bet not a science. I get that even talking about selling is unacceptable rn. But we've all been seeing what our guys do when they get profits. They give to hospitals and charities. They pay of debts and tuition. They buy PC's for little brothers, cars for moms, houses for their families, etc. Money in our hands will do more for our communities and our countries than it ever will sitting in Melvins account. I just want to make sure that we all end up getting what we deserve and stealing as much from the hedge funds as possible.

Idk if you all have felt the same vibe I have been getting from people, but many people have been saying that this run-up is:

 ""unsustainable;"" ""GME is going to Crash Hard;"" and **my most favorite ""IT'S A FUCKING BUBBLE""** 

WELL, MY ANSWER TO ALL THE FRINGES OUT THERE IS TO **PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS!** Take a look at the option chain I provided below: 

   

[GME 3year LEAPs ](https://preview.redd.it/om5j2jtqjke61.png?width=1461&format=png&auto=webp&s=63b9c9dfbf7f8a666f27e558de4a9981bb7ffa78)

As you can see here, the bid-ask spread is trading fairly within a \~$15 range with bids ranging from $191 to $175 **on a fucking 3year contract!** I's say that is highly significant given the fact that these Financial Institutions were literally betting GME would go to ZERO like yesterday. As you can see by simply looking at the contact pricing, it is trading as if it's here to stay for the foreseeable future. 

**So, if there is anyone doubting your assumptions and namesake, simply tell them ""well there's a shit-ton of money to be made betting against me.""**  By selling the Calls anywhere from about the 350 strikes to about the 400 strikes, they could collect upwards of $1800 per 1 lot. Anyways, there is serious money to be made. Yet, it would be so satisfying to see the contrarians be left forced to buy shares of a company that believed it had the same worth as the lady who gives blowies behind the Wendy's dumpster. 

**TL/DR:** GME 3year LEAPs have some sick premium, so tell whoever is gay to go sell Calls and watch them burn.

What I found is actually super interesting, to me anyways. But dont forget, past performance does not equal future performance and this is all just speculative, but then again banks and people do have patterns, so if it is as highly manipulated as they say it is, maybe this is something. Anyways heres my retard document I spent far too long on.

https://imgur.com/gallery/gA6gbZP

So bassically we have a batman pattern in 2008 and were curently on the right ear of a batman patern right now. Whats interesting is the VW infinity squeeze happened in October 08, just to the right of batmans ear. We are currently in the middle of a GME infinity squeeze, and are currently, on batmans right ear. The difference is what side of batman the crashes are, in 2008 the crash is to the right of batman, in 2020 the crash is to the left of batman. So that kills the pattern right? Wrong, in 2008 The fed didnt start the quantiative easing until 3 months after lehman brothers went bankrupt and the worst that could happen, happenned. In 2020 the fed Started QE as soon as possible, thus the reversed sides of batman make complete sense.

With all this said, this could mean that SLV will finish it's batman ear and the gme squeeze will crash SLV and then a recovery to ATH, it could mean that because of the reversed crash patterns SLV will start climbing to ATH without finishing batmans ear, or, the most likely scenario, this means absolutely nothing and I just wasted a couple hours of my weekend."|2021-01-30 20:52:05.846763|../output/raw/2021/01/30/StockTicker_205206.csv|StockTicker|['SLV']|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'ZP', 'VW', 'GME', 'QE', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'ATH', 'SLV', 'ATH', 'I']|['GME']

In 2021, u/deepfuckingvalue and u/Jeffamazon, lead the charge against some of the largest Hedge Funds in the US financial system, including Citadel and Robinhood, trying to infiltrate and destroy the most retarded short position in US finance history.  


Did you know, you would be paying back Americans and retards across the world for what happened to them, their families, and their girlfriend‚Äôs boyfriends during the 2008 financial crisis.  


We can‚Äôt thank you enough.  


Now some context:  


From February 2006 through January 2014, Bernake was Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, having been appointed to that position by both Presidents Bush and Obama. Before his appointment as chairman, Dr. Bernanke was chairman of the President‚Äôs Council of Economic Advisers, from June 2005 to January 2006. He was a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from 2002 to 2005.  


Bernanke then served as chairman of President George W. Bush‚Äôs Council of Economic Advisors before President Bush nominated him to succeed Alan Greenspan as chairman of the United States Federal Reserve. His first term began February 1, 2006. Bernanke was confirmed for a second term as chairman on January 28, 2010, after being renominated by President Barack Obama.  


Bernanke has been subjected to criticism concerning the 2008 financial crisis. According to The New York Times, Bernanke ""has been attacked for failing to foresee the financial crisis, for bailing out Wall Street, and, most recently, for injecting an additional $600 billion into the banking system to give the slow recovery a boost.""  


Bernake has also been criticized for his actions in the merging of Merrill Lynch and Bank of America.¬† In a 2009 letter to Congress, Andrew Cuomo mentioned Bernake along with former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in allegations of fraud concerning the acquisition of Merrill Lynch by BoA. The letter alleged that the extent of the losses at Merrill Lynch were not disclosed to Bank of America by Bernanke and Paulson.  


When Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis informed Paulson that Bank of America was exiting the merger by invoking the ""Materially Adverse Change"" (MAC) clause, Paulson immediately called Lewis to a meeting in Washington. At the meeting, which allegedly took place on December 21, 2008, Paulson told Lewis that he and the board would be replaced if they invoked the MAC clause and additionally not to reveal the extent of the losses to shareholders. Paulson stated to Cuomo's office that he was directed by Bernanke to threaten Lewis in this manner.  


To wrap everything up, I could write a well thought out conclusion tying Bernake to fraud and being a co-conspirator in the Robinhood/Citadel liquidity crisis but if you can‚Äôt connect the dots fuck you because you should‚Äôve stopped your uncle from reading this to you 15 minutes ago.

I'm concerned that the strong will that exists may be less strong if there is not immediate gratification for retail shareholders, particularly those who bought in over 90 and who could see big swings before the trip to Valhalla. Just putting a few things out there so all us smooth brains have time to digest the possibilities.   

Edit: to be clear. Don‚Äôt spend what you can‚Äôt afford to lose. I am not saying to to buy options. I‚Äôm saying that the lack of this happening this week may cause the price to drop so your smooth brain better be ready for the ride. 


TLDR: Best case scenario is retail investors buying far OTM options and letting large whales support the price on the way up. This is unlikely because premiums are jacked to the tits making them too expensive for retail. ITM options that are NOT exercises don't help the cause but new ITM options are too expensive to exercise for you and your wife's boyfriend. Early diamond hands win long term but not before most of your friends turn into paper handed pussi bois.  A trip to Valhalla could actually crash the market to make sure you don't lose your GME tendies on other plays. 

I have read a lot of mixed guesses at how this plays out and I want to get a read on what the hive mind thinks. 

**Infinite Squeeze = Three Concurrent Squeezes**

There are three squeezes going on

1. The squeeze from retailer buyers piling into a stock thinking it is a ticket to Valhalla

2. The gamma squeeze from  far OTM options contracts going ITM

3. The actual short squeeze

*1 & 2 are happening. 3 is not happening as new shorts have replaced old shorts.*

So a thesis need to be made on each individual squeeze and on the macro scenario.

**Immediate Term Retail Squeeze**

1. Immediate term I don‚Äôt see retail stopping. People will inevitably make bad decisions and continue to pile into the stock at almost any price. This has turned into a worldwide phenom so it‚Äôs not just US investors. The entire world is getting in on the action.

**Gamma Squeeze**

2. The most complicated of the bunch. IMO the price rise we have seen is ONLY from #1 & #2 so far and mostly from #2. The question here is WILL IT CONTINUE? ‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm not sure.

This is the area where the hedge funds have the most knowledge and the most control over pricing. That said, it‚Äôs not just the shorts at this point. Multiple hedge funds have jumped in on both sides of the trade. This means it‚Äôs billionaire vs billionaire. IMO retail will have NO IMPACT in this area because this is totally dependent on buying OTM options contracts EN MASSE that go ITM causing MM to buy shares to cover.

This ALMOST caused the real squeeze on Thursday before retail buying was cut off. The reason it could have happened last week but not in the future is because the high from the option chain a week ago was 60 & the high from the option chain yesterday was averaging out \~320 (they added new highs everyday last week)  which is why we saw such a battle at the 320 price on Friday close.

For the gamma squeeze to continue the price MUST go up. BIGLY. As far into the extreme OTM options (too highly priced for retail) as possible. IF it happens it could trigger the real squeeze. I think this is the angle long hedge positions are attempting. Buy OTM calls, drive price up on low volume, exercise shares (again, retail can‚Äôt do this because 320 \* 100 = 32k) and then hold shares for squeeze #3

**The Trip to Valhalla**

3. It will happen at some point but no one knows when that point will be. It very well could be a year from now or it could be Monday. The longer it goes on the more chance there is for something to happen that would eliminate it from happening.

&#x200B;

**How Much is Actually Short**

The common knowledge says GME is \~130% short sold, but I‚Äôm going to consider the hedge funds more sophisticated than that and assume that positions like synthetic longs and other hedges we are not aware of are in play, driving down ‚Äúreal‚Äù short to something extreme but not totally unwindable for the shorts if they get lucky.

So, something like this could happen....

Assume a squeeze could be prevented at 20% less short than wherever we are currently. What if GME issues that much in new shares? The get gobbled up by shorts, not eliminating their upcoming ass fucking by delaying it long enough that retail interest fades. 

Or‚Ä¶ the SEC steps in. The NYSE delists GME for ""fraud"".  Or some other existential  threat comes into play.

So‚Ä¶ the question is‚Ä¶ will these squeezes happen.

Best case scenario is that #1 or #2 work and #3 is triggered. This is the ‚Äúinfinite squeeze‚Äù.

If that happens many millionaires are minted. 

BUT‚Ä¶ that seems unlikely meaning what else could happen‚Ä¶ what is ‚Äúlikely‚Äù?

Here a take‚Ä¶ hedge funds attempt #2. It doesn‚Äôt work because long options are so expensive, high volatility etc &  GME shorts have enough capital to keep fucking with price action (easier to do with low volume) and retail taps out on buying options because they are expensive. 

At the same time, retail continues to pile into shares (options are too expensive). When hedge longs fail the price drops as MM can unwind their extreme positions. Retail shits their pants & sells. **This isn‚Äôt out of the question as retail was already a net seller last week**. That's right, there are paper hands among us!

The price goes right back down to 40, anyone who wasn't in at a low cost basis (ie most people) sell shares,  GME shorts profit off hedge positions on the way up & down giving them enough capital to fight another day. GME does a stock issuance, putting more shares into the market. #3 is still on the table but the timeline moves from days to months giving shorts a long runway to unwind and a perfect (highly volatile) environment to play both sides against the middle to be net neutral or within a tolerable margin of loss on their original position.

So we are left with‚Ä¶ short term #1 pushes #2 into happening (with assistance of long hedge help) which pushes #3 into happening or ‚Ä¶ paper hands shake out everyone but the earliest entrants. 

**WHAT WOULD HELP**

Retail buying OTM options helps but it REALLY helps if they can exercise the option. This takes a lot of cash. Most won't be able to. 

Good = options moving ITM. Price moving higher. Bad = Highest concentration of options expiring next Friday doesn‚Äôt happen retail thinks things are moving too slow & paper hands. 

Best thing that could happen is retail continues to buy far OTM options along with long hedge support of price which spikes price soon.   


**WHAT MIGHT HURT**

If the trip to Valhalla actually takes off we may get rich but the big boys are going to be selling off other stocks like crazy. There is a real liquidity issue in the market right now  ( you saw it this week with the brokerage/clearinghouse fuckups) and historically, systemic liquidity issues lock up the market and real crashes happen. So... if #3 happens, pay attention to your other positions and consider hedging your wins! Again, not financial advice.

Their total cash is puny, and **most of it is segregated under federal regulations**. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required. This is why they keep halting buying, because they simply can't handle further buying power.

There is a significant chance that had they not halted trading on the relevant stocks the day of the fiasco, they would've been **insolvent** by close of trading. **This is why they raised $1 billion as an emergency from investors.**

Posting this article here as it seems like information worth digesting prior to the Robinhood mass exodus. Not advocating one way or the other, simply interested in the truth. To those of you that actually know... is this true? Article below:

A little-known intermediary in the process of buying and selling equities forced Robinhood and other brokers to restrict trading in several securities on Thursday, including GameStop , AMC Entertainment , BlackBerry , and Nokia . All have been swept up in the WallStreetBets-fueled short-squeeze phenomenon and have seen intense volatility in recent days.

Theories abounded online about Robinhood‚Äîa mobile-first, low-cost brokerage founded on the idea of expanding access to trading to more people‚Äîbeing in league with the ‚Äúmen in suits‚Äù at hedge funds on the losing side of those trades. Politicians on Twitter from across the political spectrum condemned the broker‚Äôs move. But Robinhood‚Äôs provided reason that it needed to restrict trading in those stocks until it could increase its collateral with the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation, or DTCC, holds water.

Explaining that requires getting into a bit of market plumbing and elements of the trading process that usually don‚Äôt get much attention.

When an investor orders their broker‚ÄîRobinhood or E*Trade, for example‚Äîto buy or sell a security, the broker accepts the trade and sends it to an exchange like the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. The exchange then matches buyers with sellers, and from the investor‚Äôs perspective, the transaction is as good as done. But there are still some mechanics that need to be worked out behind the scenes.

Investors may have noticed that the cash proceeds from selling a stock aren‚Äôt immediately available to withdraw from their account after a trade is completed‚Äîthat usually takes a business day or two. Back in the day, that time was spent physically exchanging stock certificates between brokers. Today‚Äôs trading volumes make that an impossible task.

Today, after a stock exchange completes a trade, it sends the information to the DTCC, which keeps track of brokers‚Äô books. The DTCC is a clearing house, an important part of the financial system. Clearing houses not only process and complete trades in an efficient manner, they help limit systemic risk. The clearing house promises to make good on all trades that happen regardless of what happens to an individual broker.

The DTCC is responsible for transferring ownership of the stock from the seller‚Äôs broker to the buyer‚Äôs broker‚Äîand vice versa for the cash involved. Rather than doing that after every single one of the trillions of dollars of trades each day, the DTCC waits until it can net several trades into ‚Äúone position per security, per client, per settlement date,‚Äù according to its website. The settlement date is the day when the cash and securities involved in a trade actually change hands.

At the settlement date, which falls two days after the investor places their trade, the seller‚Äôs broker must deliver the stock being sold and the buyer‚Äôs broker must provide the cash. The DTCC guarantees that the transfer will happen and eliminates the risk of a single broker going under rippling across the market.

In exchange, the DTCC collects a fee per trade and requires some collateral from the brokers to ensure they have the assets to complete the transaction. It‚Äôs like putting a refundable deposit on a purchase that reduces the middleman‚Äôs risk while the package is in the mail, with full payment due once it arrives. The DTCC‚Äôs collateral requirements for brokers are calculated by a much more complex formula, based on the specific shares‚Äô notional value, volatility, and other variables.

For a relatively risk-free transaction‚Äîin liquid, less volatile stocks like, say, Apple (AAPL) or Microsoft (MSFT)‚Äîthat collateral requirement could be around the order of 10% of the transaction value. For a stock like GameStop this week, the DTCC‚Äôs formula might spit out a collateral requirement several times higher than that because it takes on greater risk. That‚Äôs because the DTCC could be on the hook to deliver an asset that‚Äôs worth a materially different amount on the settlement date than the trade date if one of the brokers involved can‚Äôt complete the transaction.

When traders are using margin to buy, the broker needs to come up with the cash on its own. And when there‚Äôs a large imbalance between a broker‚Äôs buy and sell orders for a given security, it doesn‚Äôt net out as cleanly at the end of the day, meaning more collateral is required.

All of those factors applied to Robinhood and Gamestop on Thursday. The stock traded in a wide range from $112 to $438 on heavy volume, its users were predominantly placing buy orders for the shares, and many were using margin.

And those are the reasons the DTCC asked brokers for more collateral for each such trade. The clearing house didn‚Äôt want to be caught with brokers not having the funds they need to settle. Therefore, Robinhood and others restricted buying on these highflying stocks until it could come up with enough cash to pay collateral. Robinhood allowed users to sell the stocks because the selling broker puts up the shares as collateral, not cash.

Since then, the brokerage has drawn down its credit lines at several banks and brought in $1 billion from existing investors to fund additional collateral requirements. On Friday, Robinhood reopened buying of Gamestop and other recently popular stocks.

The DTCC says it processes trillions of dollars of transactions a day, including equities, bonds, mutual funds, and derivatives. It said that collateral requirements for all of its broker clients were $33.5 billion on Thursday, up from $26 billion the day before.

All credit goes to Nicholas Jasinski with Barron‚Äôs

Sorry if this DD sucks ass and leads a bunch of people to ditch $AMC. Just focus on the future, and think about the mind of the consumer. Most of that shit they teach in business school is bullshit is trash. Trust me. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

‚Äã
I will return to that a bit later in this DD. Here's another take based on fundamentals on why you might consider $AMC at \~$13/share one of the great value investment opportunities of our time. ~~Bear~~ with me as I, too, am just a retard like some of the readers here.
‚Äã
Let's begin with the basic asymmetries in a macroeconomic context:
‚Äã
* Market Cap (MC):  427.869 M
* Enterprise Value (EV): 11.349 B
‚Äã

When seeing that figure, you might wonder if you don't know shit, why might a company have an enterprise value so much greater than its Market Cap. A Company's EV is the total debt + market cap - cash on hand. As you may have heard in the recent news, nobody is having trouble getting access to cash. So then, why might that figure be significant at all if it is practically just about how much the company owes + aggregate value of the stonk. Well, my father used to say, the price of a product is what someone is willing to pay for it. If someone wanted to buy or takeover AMC, they need to pay around 11.349 B. In a few months, I anticipate that number to be so much higher.
‚Äã

The main reason I think $AMC dropped so low and generated so much short seller risk to begin with is the fact that there was a bankruptcy risk. That risk has been wholly eliminated, though I never saw it.
‚Äã

As we find ourselves in a cash flush world where at least 18 Trillion in debt is negative yielding ([mostly bonds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-11/world-s-negative-yield-debt-pile-at-18-trillion-for-first-time)), we should expect a company with so many assets and a previously healthy balance sheet like AMC to be have access to some of it. The rising stonk price even incentivized Silverlake to convert their debt to shares and sell them (silly bankers).
‚Äã

At the same time, the all-star CEO boomer Adam Aron himself grabbed an additional $304.8 M in cash through a direct listing initiated on Monday. I don't know why he couldn't wait until Wednesday to initiate because [it would've been over $1B](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-stock-sale/amc-seizes-on-rally-to-sell-stock-but-misses-even-bigger-payday-idUSKBN29W2UP). I trust his judgement. Boomers are more experienced and have ~~steady~~ hands. At the same time, Aron beat back the well known short selling smuts known as Apollo Global Management as they attempted to force bankruptcy on AMC.
‚Äã

The confluence of these factors (EV, Access to Liquidity, Stellar Executive Team) and the four I outline below, lead me to believe that even Stevie Wonder can see that this stock is obviously worth at least $30/share.  
‚Äã
‚Äã

**The undisputed market leader in theaters.**
‚Äã

* 1,0004 Theatres worldwide
   * Many auditoriums at AMC locations, often holding over more than one auditorium, seat over 400 people. 
      * They posted 5.47 million in revenues. Auditoriums were rarely at capacity.
   * 8,043 screens/auditoriums.
   * They will all be packed when opened back up.
      * Tons of really great movies were held anticipating the end of the lockdown and the re-opening of the movies. Keep this in mind. This is critical to the fundamental analysis and related to the subsequent points.
   * Margins are *ok* but especially good on the snacks. In the past, consumers have tended to say fuck AMC's margins and bring in their own goodies either because AMC's were ass or because they wanted to save a few dollars. We expect this pattern to slow down substantially because of what they mean for the people.  I recognize that this one is a reach, but it's my opinion not investment advice.
‚Äã

**The shifting sentiment from ""Netflix and Chill"" to in-person, shared and enjoyable experience.**
‚Äã

* I don't like people, but I miss them. Maybe you do too. In a mid-pandemic Gallup Poll, we all know how much those matter, [https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/movie-theaters-covid-consumers-uncomfortable-1234846743/](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/movie-theaters-covid-consumers-uncomfortable-1234846743/). If I just put my finger in the air and give 35% of Netflix's market cap to AMC... you see where I'm going with this.
* I have seen others say this one as well, but I miss when everyone went to the movies and watch the same thing, on the same screen, at the same time because we can share. 
* Netflix and the streamers need to watch out because come July, the boomer is coming with that heat. Everyone is anticipating trips to movies. I tried to make the popcorn. I used a half a stick of butter. It's not the same.
   * Running to 7-Eleven to get Slurpees and Raisinets while Netflix is buffering is super annoying. Last time, my 7-Eleven didn't even have Raisinets. \[Samuel L. Jackson voice\] ""Where's my mothafuckin Raisinets Jack?""
* As you think through this point, remember the last time you saw Samuel L. Jackson in the theaters. you weren't the only that was scared, so it was entertaining and not stressful.
* This point isn't totally out of my ass either. As streaming popularity has grown, so has AMC's  revenues, not including 2020. People watch more movies.
‚Äã

**Relationship with distributors and studios is still a strong moat.**   

Everyone here should check out a movie. They don't have the awesome search and browse capabilities afforded by Netflix or the sweeping device compatibility. You can stream from your laptop and connect to your.  
‚Äã
‚Äã
* Studios have ben delaying their films repeatedly to wait for AMC to open back up. To me, that sounds like immense power and a very strong relationship. I commend the studios for that and I think you have to be a hedge fund jackass not value that moat accordingly. Even Morningstar sees that and they usually don't see shit!
* The Netflix app is cool but we can all agree, &amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 80% of the content is ass. Movies are a crap shoot. Shows are a political statement. And there's not enough Chapelle.
   * What Chapelle represents amongst so many other things is someone who has walked away from the traditional film industry. While I am all for the new person on the block, I feel movies are very hard to make. Sometimes the Netflix ones suck hard. I don't recall too many times when I went to a movie theater and had to leave because the movie sucked that bad. I've been disappointed, underwhelmed, but have never chucked my remote at the screen. I cannot say the same about Netflix. I have seen some terrible shit on Netflix, multiple times. I go there every day still because their app is so good, but Hollywood is still better at making films than Los Gatos or wherever the fuck. \*
* You can rent some of the movies that would be in theaters now. I'm sure the quality of the acting and dialogue will be superior to the shit we often get on Netflix.
   * I haven't done it yet, but I promise to do it for the first time tonight as I discovered the [On Demand](https://www.amctheatres.com/movies/news-of-the-world-61825) product line in doing some research for this DD. I assure you that the products will be overpriced, and the digital experience will be ass, but they just got $300 M to go figure that shit out. 
   * Boomer CEO: Lower your price point and move your on-prem servers to EC2 instances. You got this! Re-invest hard for a while as you build up the integrations to be a first-class citizen in Roku, etc. 

‚Äã
**Fresh Short-Squeezed Orange Juice.**

In doing more research, I learned that both AMC and AMCX were seeing incredible short interest. Every resource I used reported both higher than they should be, but the inconsistency in the numbers from trusted and premium services has led me to withhold my numbers.  The ranges for AMC were between 24% of total float and 68% of total float. When I tried to calculate myself based on short interest theory and the average volume of the stock as of  a month ago, I landed at 62. Since I am retarded, the answer is probably in the 40-50. 

‚Äã
*Current short volume:* 44,670,000 shares

*True Float:*  71,000,000 shares
‚Äã
*Dollar Volume Sold Short:* $385.50 million 
‚Äã
On the last one yes, you read that right. This idiots have sold more volume in price than the market cap of the stock. How could they do this shit all over again. They don't give a fuck. They think they will get away with it. 
‚Äã

Regardless, some idiots sold another 8,000,000 shares short ON FRIDAY. Well, I have 2500 shares across four platforms. I am buying more on Monday, but my buddy had an interesting idea because the stock is so low. Options may actually be an even better play for me because I can buy hundreds of them (thanks to this subreddit). If I exercise as many options as I can hold the stock with diamond hands, it could accelerate the gamma squeeze that will happen if those short selling assholes don't back down.  And we know they won't . 

‚Äã
In closing, as with $GME, I have fond memories of my times at AMC as a child and teenager. It was the first place my friend drove me after he got his license. 
‚Äã
Also as with $GME, I like the stock.

‚Äã
*Positions*

‚Äã
shares: 2479, avg cost basis of 6.54,  I have been building up for a while

‚Äã
options: a lot (strike prices ranging from $2.5 to $9 because these jackasses thought they knew wtf was going on but are out of touch with the commoner. On Monday, I will buy more. 98% of my options are already in cheese.
‚Äã
‚Äã
On WeBull, I learned that you can buy stonks starting at 4 AM / 7 AM or something like that so I am moving some money in there.
‚Äã
Edit: If you set a limit order of 100 to expire in 90 days, the brokerage cannot sell your shares. If you still don‚Äôt want to sell at that price and it gets close, just add another $100. Never sell, but always have a limit order if these short sellers want to try and screw you out of deep fucking value.

I have worked in propaganda prevention, phishing, technical control implementation, and cyber-warfare capacities. Some of you are retarded, if not most of you. So I have written this guide to help you understand the tools, tactics, and procedures used by nation-states, organised crime, and bad actors to persuade people to take actions outside of their own best interests!

EDIT ***TLDR: Don't trust anything you read on this site, feel free to not trust my content too!***

At this stage, you are seeing a combination of all three techniques being used by a combination of nation states and financial sector bad actors. Spend five minutes looking into US foreign relations if you want to understand why nation states are interested in manipulating the outcome of this short squeeze.

1. Obfuscation is the action of making something obscure, unclear, or unintelligible.
2. Misinformation is false or inaccurate information that is communicated regardless of an intention to deceive.
3. Propaganda is information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote a political cause or point of view.

Anyway, here are some things to look out for, a **TLDR at the end will help you understand your best defensive measures available**.

# Creating Noise

We are seeing a significant uptick in bot traffic to Reddit, Twitter, and other social media. This appears in all data really, especially trading data. Adversaries like to create noise to make it difficult to get truly valuable information for a standard user. We are seeing 7 million members in WallStreetBets. At this stage, it is very likely that over a million of those accounts are involved in propaganda.

While our moderators have some success with using automated moderation to remove low-karma or low-age accounts, any sensible blackhat offensive security outfit would have created thousands or potentially hundreds of thousands of accounts pre-emptively over time. Alternatively, they would have a suite of compromised reddit accounts ready for use. If you share your password across multiple websites, there is a great chance you have at least been involved in a data-breach and had some of your accounts stealth-stolen.

With a lot of accounts available, you can then set them up to either automatically post content either calling Reddit API's (Captcha doesn't do shit, check appsec california 2019) or you can use something like mechanical turk service to pay literal peanuts to poor people to do menial tasks. So, expect that a lot of activity in this sub-reddit, on twitter, and on other social media is coming from non-reputable sources and designed to mislead you.

# Excessive Information

Detailed analysis, legalese, or complicated sentences are a fantastic way to mislead people. Consider what the average person is, and then remember 50% of the population are stupider than them. A lot of narrative strength and credibility comes simply from using language that is difficult to parse or comprehend for the average person. If you see posts that are using very technical language, remember that either the person has no idea how to communicate, or they are very intentional with how they are communicating.

# Internal Jargon Builds Trust

By using jargon and language that is familiar to people, you are in a position of trust. As an adversary, I would always do reconnaisance ahead of time to understand the culture of the organisation I am targetting. Once you have the internal language mastered, you can build credibility with your sentences. Apes be strong, Retard Strength, Guh, whatever. This is a public forum, it will be easy for an adversary to gain trust and credibility from using our language.

# Expert Analysis vs Crowdsourced Expertise

Nowadays, humans are migrating away from expert PoV's towards crowd-sourced or community views. This has some positives, sometimes experts get it wrong especially in the field of economics and finance. Secondly, like getting a second opinion from a doctor, you're able to get a seemingly broader perspective about what is good.

The problem with this is that you cannot always rely on crowd-sourced expertise, and academic standards often have very rigorous procedures involved. Now, in this situation, you can't rely on a uni whitepaper. This is fairly unprecedented. But you shouldn't entirely discount the opinions of experts in the media at the same time.

# Qualitative vs Quantitive Data

As humans, we tend to easily believe Quantitive Data over Qualitative. Numbers, Math, Statistics, Charts, they all require significantly more effort to disprove than to create. Because of this lopsided nature, they're used a lot fo misinform and manipulate opinion. Especially concerning is that most individuals do not feel qualified to question empirical data.

# Summing up or TLDR

* There is a significant increase in content attributable to both new-users, bad actors, and bots. There is a lot of copy-pasting, a lot of meme'ing, and also a lot of bullshit. Don't get stressed by the sheer amount of content available now and take everything you read with an open mind that it may not be written in your best interest.
* There will be a lot of new technical posts trying to explain the situation. Remember that most retards can't comprehend anything like that. Good Autists can choose to write in a non-technical way to help us apes. Bad actors will intentionally choose difficult language to build credibility. Question things that aren't written in CLEAR and SIMPLE language.
* You can't do much about hiding our cultural language, everybody knows it now. Just remember that there are some novice adversaries who will be 'fellow school kids' and not do their reconnaisance. Also remember that you will feel more trusting of users who use this language, and pull that emotion back.
* While mainstream media is looking into manipulating content for their hedge-fund masters, remember that there are still academics and other independent experts who can provide good analysis. Reddit is good for crowd-sourcing expertise, but don't forget that independent academics exist too who are, arguably, more difficult to manipulate.
* Don't trust charts, statistics, or anything numerical at face value. This content is chosen because it is difficult and time-consuming to disprove, and provided legitimacy and credibility to the author with low effort. If you lack expertise in that area, consider the chart or opinion to be misleading by default.

Hope this helps you redditors with your memes over the next month, I expect a huge disinformation campaign to continue to be orchestrated against this subreddit for a long time to come."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001638.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['I', 'I', 'I', 'EDIT', 'US', 'TLDR', 'A', 'I', 'I', 'TLDR', 'CLEAR', 'IMPLE', 'I']|[]

GME is not the joke. In fact, GME is the only *sane* thing in the market now. The strategy is not based on the fundamentals, *which is the whole fucking point*. These hedgefunds are so confident that they can manipulate the price of the stock that they are *massively over risked*. GME is not a joke, the idea that the market is fair or that it is measuring actual value is the joke and the autists here are proving it.

2) Robinhood isn't exactly the bad guy. Run by a pussy maybe, but probably not corrupt. The brokers and clearing houses have a legal obligation to be able to clear trades for their clients. If they can't, they need to take action. No one can get *actual shares* of GME right now, which is the effect of the strategy. The hedgefunds need to buy it and they can't, which is exactly the effect we are hoping for. No one can, which is why if Robinhood wanted to buy GME for it's customer they'd need to have 100% of the value at the broker/clearing house. This means they COULD get it, but they literally need to send trucks of cash to the clearing house before they could do so, this takes time and the CEO of Robinhood is obviously a pussy and thinks that bringing the market to the people is about making the buy button prettier and not about flexing the muscle of 1M users. His actual job should be to get a line of credit from a bank that's across the street from the clearing house or w/e. I don't know the actual details because I don't work in the industry, but anyone should be able to figure this out after a few hours of reading threads here over the past few days. If anyone can get GME right now it's because their broker is taking some risk of they have a line of credit with the broker. Robinhood simply isn't willing to take a *risk* on your behalf, which is very different from them simply blocking your buy button on behalf of some backroom handshake deal.

Edit: Let me make this very simple for all you extra special retards: you can't buy something that no one is selling. Neither can Robinhood, neither can their broker, neither can their clearing house(whether that's Robinhood themselves, DST, or anyone else). I agree that Vlad is a moron and a pussy. The Hedgefunds can't get stock, this is what we want. If we effect a strategy where-in Hedgefunds can't get the stock, do you really think Vlad is going to be able to get it? Vlad is just the king-retard of the retards that think that buying a stock is as complicated as clicking the big green buy button."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001644.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'COULD', 'CEO', 'M', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'DST', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'DST']

If you have not heard of the prisoner's dilemma, here is a quick rundown. 

Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge, but they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The possible outcomes are:

If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves two years in prison

If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve three years in prison

If A remains silent but B betrays A, A will serve three years in 
prison and B will be set free

If A and B both remain silent, both of them will serve only one year in prison (on the lesser charge).

In our case snitching is selling, and holding is remaining silent. And the jail sentence is ""losing your money"", so by selling you won't ""lose"".

As you can see in the prisoner's dilemma it is most logical that the two gang members will snitch on each other in order to look out for themselves - even though it is the worst decision. The thing is in reality however, humans have shown a great deal of co-operation.

The reality is that people will hold, and by not holding you ultimately fuck yourself over as well as the rest of everyone else. So while it might seem rational selling, the truth is it is more rational holding.

I've heard a lot of talk about people saying ""It's not about the money"" in regards to $GME but I feel that misses the practical mark.  Do any of you ever want to be able to make money on stocks ever again? Because of the possibility of the little guy coming out a little ahead on one stock, Robinhood has trading restrictions on 50 stocks now: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-expands-trading-restrictions-50-225241993.html

This is absurd, this is manipulation of all sorts of companies that have gone in and out of WSB popularity over the years.  For instance, they don't want you buying $AMD after they just killed it at earnings?  Their PE is only 41, that's nothing compared to the ~180 it was back in June of 2019.  It's a much safer bet now, risk wise.  They're doing this to put us all in our place.

I thought I'd outsmart everyone else here and buy into $NOK before it took off, well now $NOK is restricted too.  And you know what?  I'm never going to make a dime on it if $GME doesn't succeed.  It has occurred to me if I ever want to see a return ever again, I need to buy some $GME at market open monday. And I might never be able to sell.  Because once we start selling, the price will go down fast and the shorts will win.  So the only way to win is to never sell.  If we win, we'll bleed them dry and they'll think twice before trying to screw us again.  The only way to win is to buy $GME and never sell.

TL;DR- Buy and hold $GME until the end of time."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001638.csv|StockTicker|['$GME']|['GME']|['I', 'I', '$GME', 'I', 'WSB', '$AMD', 'PE', 'I', '$NOK', '$NOK', '$GME', 'I', 'I', '$GME', 'I', '$GME', '$GME']|['GME', 'AMD', 'PE', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

**OBLIGATORY - $GMEüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ (YES THAT IS 7 ROCKET EMOJIS SO YOU KNOW IM DAMN SERIOUS).**

It‚Äôs ya boy here, ElJefe and boyyyyyy do I have something to share with you!

Hold onto your seats, because what I‚Äôm about to share IS a doozy and it might help make a lot of connections with what the fuck is going on related to this whole GME fiasco, that is now turning into some chance opportunity for $SLV to return to the main stage as another **‚Äúsqueeze opportunity‚Äù.**

Listen we all should know by now that the news we are shown is mostly used to control a narrative for a certain group and this is **NO DIFFERENT OF A TIME**.  The thing that is so unique with this situation is how intertwined things are more than you are lead to believe. 

Does anyone find it amazing that 1 company Robinhood) was able capture the attention of millions upon millions of NEW retail investors by simply creating an app that is understandable and is easy to use? Think of it, Robinhood opened the door to change people‚Äôs lives by guiding them through the transaction process for stocks and people started to open their eyes and realize that making money to sustain your life doesn‚Äôt need to take a whole bunch of your time away from you. 

So here is where the story begins.

Robinhood as many of you know was **heavily** funded by a Market Maker that is known as Citadel (previously Wellington management, which was founded in 1933 by Walter L. **Morgan**(weird coincidence, but maybe popular name in the day üôÉ) as the first balanced mutual fund).

Citadel not only is a market maker, but they also are the providers of a certain component of the transaction process known as immediate or cancel interface. Check out ‚ÄúCitadel Connect‚Äù - which essentially is known for the immediate or cancel interface that is baked directly into the transaction process for Brokerages. So they have their hand in a lot of cookie jars across brokerages, to say the least. They also provide a system of algorithmic trading that helps automatic trading for their clients and more! Check out their website, it is eye opening the power this single company really has over the exchange. 

Now keep in mind from before, Citadel gave Robinhood a **SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY** to get them going because they saw a huge opportunity with having **MORE** retail traders joining the party and that opportunity was **DATA**. Citadel has instant and live trading data access to every single trade you make (hence why you usually notice an immediate opposing force from the stock you are buying - buy call and stock goes down right away, buy put and stock goes up right away), this is not something you are imagining, Citadels algorithm is literally taking this data in real time, and placing the most favorable trade for Citadel, which usually starts mind fucking you with your position right off the bat. Remember emotional trading will always lose, and they fuck with your emotions IMMEDIATELY (usually).

So Robinhood ‚Äî> Citadel.

Next is JP Morgan. The banker. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait up. A *Morgan* started the original Citadel (Wellington), remember? Seems like a killer coincidence! Is Walter somehow related to John Pierpont? Even if indirectly, they bare the same family name... hmmm weird, but I can‚Äôt seem to find any relation on good old Google! So we‚Äôll leave this just as a coincidence. 

Back to JP Morgan - they would be the next in line to pay up or default and they are fully aware of the immensity of an infinite squeeze and now are in a position where they would be ones losing huge amounts of money. They have a lot of smart people working for them that quickly caught onto this and starting creating a contingency plan of some kind of to recoup some of the losses they are about to experience.

**This is where $SLV/Silver comes into play and WHY YOU ARE SEEING IT POP UP MORE FREQUENTLY.**

For those who unaware, $SLV is the ishares Silver Trust (which is blackrock‚Äôs silver etf). The silver squeeze **IS** something to have happened before and guess who was able to benefit **SIGNIFICANTLY** off of the sell off of the last $SLV rally... JP Morgan. How‚Äôd they do this? **They shorted the fuck out of it.** Check out JP Morgan‚Äôs history with the precious metals market - https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html. They paid, but still made out like bandits with profits. 

Weird how when JP Morgan is about to lose a metric fuck ton of money, $SLV all of a sudden becomes ‚Äúviral‚Äù and we start seeing it popping up everywhere as the ‚Äúnext squeeze‚Äù, but maybe just a coincidence, right? 

Recap Robinhood ‚Äî> Citadel ‚Äî> JP Morgan would be the defaulted order. JP Morgan will need to recoup losses somehow, and what better way then A short on Silver whilst writing options during the run up?

Hence why $SLV has became viral.

So in essence. Stay the fuck away from Silver stocks unless you really know what you‚Äôre doing. Our mission is to focus on üíéü§≤üèªing GME. **EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS BEING** ***SHILLED*** **IS A DISTRACTION**. 



Also, Citadel should be another entity we are burning at the stake, not just Robinhood. Citadel is pulling off the greatest heist in history and the rest of the hedgies are just benefiting from this fiasco.

We all are seeing a ton of posts and comments right now stating the absolute worst case scenarios as fact in regards to Robinhood. 
  
They are exercising cash positions as margin.  
They are locking your accounts due to owing less than a dollar.  
They will be bankrupt by Monday morning.  
Etc, etc, etc.  
  
Numerous users stating others need to transfer assets and positions out of RH asap.  
Numerous users stating others need to just sell and reinvest with other brokers.  
Numerous users stating others need to sell before trading is halted for 30 days, or RH goes under and locks your shares, costing you potentially hundreds of thousands, or millions.  
  
First, nobody here can give YOU financial advice. That is not who, or what, WSB is about. Do your own research based off of what you read here, THEN make an educated decision with YOUR money.  
  
Second, ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS check the comment and post history, INCLUDING CONTENT, NOT JUST KARMA, of anyone posting something that may make you worry about your positions, or your brokerage.  
  
This sub has grown exponentially (that means bigger, for you retards) in a VERY small amount of time. We have new members. Extremely vulnerable and inexperienced investors/gamblers. You are who I am directing this to.  
  
This is a war of Hedge Funds versus individual investors. There are no rules in war, as we are seeing. If they need to make accounts here to scare people into selling, they will.  
  
They are.  
  
Again, neither myself, nor any other fucking retard here, can give anyone advice as to what to do.  
  
But, before you do anything, be educated about the current situation. Be informed about the upcoming possibilities. Be skeptical of posters and commenters. 
  
You fucking retards.

It's happening.  We're winning.  We're holding.  We're not selling.  We're buying the dips. We're applying the pressure.  We're juicing the squeeze, which has yet to squoze.  More diamond handing will be demanded of us. And we'll handle it no sweat.  

It's just math.  The hedgies are fucked.  We sit on our shares, and they bleed.  Not blood of course, but the only thing they care about.

Money.

We're hitting em in the only place they care about - their wallets.  We're actually getting our chance.  To get back some of the money that they soaked up for destroying the economy in 2008.  To get out of debt.  To pay the bills.  To buy a house.  To pay for the treatment. To have a retirement.

This is the first hopeful, dare I say optimistic time in many of our lives.  Not only at the prospect of making some perhaps life changing money, nor only to put the screws to the elites that fuck us over without a second thought.  But at how unifying this experience has been.  I feel a bond with each of you, for holding strong through the ups and downs, and diamond handing with ice in your veins and steel in your glare.  Memes are on point too.

There was no massive selloff.  The volume was low.  We made it through this last week.  We can make it through this next one. And on for however long the shorts would like to continue bleeding.

We *will* have our infinite squeeze.

And it will be glorious.

RH clearly doesn't want the retail sector coming out ahead here. If GME were to hit 5k a share or whatever, could they just disable selling? Or could they ""go down"" for a day at peak times?

Is there any recourse for someone who might want to sell but can't due to app/website errors? If I try to initiate a sell at X time, but it doesn't go through because of problems on their end, is there any way I can prove that and force them to sell at the amount I asked for, or am I SOL?

I'm not just asking for myself, I'm asking for the probably hundreds of thousands of us sitting with shares in RH who can't move to Fidelity or another broker because the securities transfer would take too long. We have no choice but to hold out hope that if the iron gets hot, we'll be allowed to strike.

For the record, I plan on holding until at least 10k, and depending on how the next couple of weeks go that might be increasing substantially. I just want to know that I can GET the fair price for my stocks if I do sell and that RH isn't going to fuck me over and then play the ""whoopsie, network error!"" card. 

I mean people could sue for such an event, right?

Edit: I think we need a plan for people in such a situation. If enough people are screen recording, showing the precise moment they were trying to buy or sell and exactly what happened, and then getting together and amassing a huge amount of proof, RH is going to have to capitulate. Maybe we should make a sub just in anticipation of this kind of problem. I'm not even joking, I think it would be useful. We have the right to sell our stocks and participate in the market. If they interfere with that we need to be able to show it.

Edit 2: I completely agree about getting out of RH as soon as possible. They're a garbage service. The issue is that if I move my shares now to another broker, that could take weeks and in the meantime I would be locked out of making any moves.

This is a thread about educating each other on what your opponent could do  to fuck you over.

I see so many people saying price targets of $GME to $1,000, $10,000, $50,000... as if buying back the shares they shorted is your opponent‚Äôs only option... Is it REALLY their only option? Everyone who believes that without questioning other tactics is really underestimating Wall Street.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I‚Äôll start with this question. Who did the shorts borrow shares from? Do those people care about getting their shares returned or do they just care about cash and their agreed upon interest rate? 

If that‚Äôs the case, what stops a short seller from making a side deal with them that says 

‚Äúrecovering your shares is a lost cause, here is a lump sum. Your shares are no longer borrowed, they‚Äôve been sold. This is a better deal for you and me because if we fail, you won‚Äôt get paid‚Äù

On Thursday, when all the Robinhood chaos unfolded and the price artificially plummeted, I saw the opportunity to jump in and picked up a single, Feb 19th $320 call.

**Come Monday, I'm prepared to buy up to $100k+ worth of stock and/or options.** However, I first want to explore a couple of various scenarios that we may see play out and think through the potential effects with you guys ... no matter how unlikely they are. I'll try to be succinct.

# Scenario 1: issuance of new blocks of stock at ~market value

If I'm not mistaken, Q1 for Gamestop begins Feb 1. Say they want to capitalize on everything by essentially, sending a bailout package to hedge funds - the very ones responsible for shorting them in the first place. This would be in an effort to shore up their finances and provide them enough capital to easily explore ways to adapt their business. Likely, this would come with strings attached. e.g. Hedge funds receiving new shares cannot sell for n years.

**Potential Outcomes:**

1. HFs close out their short positions and short interest plummets. No more squeeze looks promising because the only shorts remaining would be those which shorted in the $300+ range. üíéüôå don't have a strong incentive to hold, nor try to compete against these remaining shorts. Retail selling begins.
2. ?

# Scenario 2: short interest isn't all telling

We are all aware that short interest is extremely high - quite likely still over 100%. However, with the recent blast of all media coverage from *reputable* networks, all are claiming Melvin, Citron, and Muddy Waters have all closed their short positions. I find this hard to believe and suspect. Sounds like a shitty PR campaign and obvious plea/attempt to instill fear.

Let's just assume that these reports are true. We can then infer that this extremely high short interest is more likely held near the $77, $160, $380 - $483 levels (just taking daily highs).

If that's the case, for the sake of argument, let's assume the $77 shorts have closed their positions - helping drive the price up to the next levels.

**Potential Impact:**

1. Short interest remains extremely high, but the current market value ($325) is not enough pressure to initiate a squeeze - assuming these firms have enough capital to not be in danger of a margin call. Or, perhaps those that are in trouble, have decided to sell off other positions in the market to remain in good standing - hence the overall market decline this week.
2. ?

**Potential Outcomes:**

1. &#x200B;
   1. üíéüôåstay impenetrable. However, it becomes an extremely long dragged out war until they get tired of paying the short interest fees which are insanely high - especially for new shorts.
   2. üíéüôå turn paper. Without deep pockets, we would need continued institutional longs to help push this into a squeeze.

&#x200B;

There are plenty of wholes in each scenario on why it's so unlikely or not possible. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this as well.

TL;DR

For everyone on here that can't read, I‚Äôll keep it short & sweet. Some of you may know I‚Äôve been long GameStop since 2017. We finally exceeded my fair market value, a goal I had always dreamed of. I sold \~95%. üßª ü§ö. Price has gone so far beyond my $169 bull case. The remaining 300 shares march onward to crush the Persian hedge funds in lockstep with those of you still fully strapped aboard the üöÄüöÄ üöÄ . I believe it is more likely than not we see a higher high.

WORDS:

We flew past it so quickly that I even managed to sell myself a meme-orable fill as I was taking profits. üßªüñêü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è compared to the immaculate /u/DeepFuckingValue‚Äîhe has only trimmed while I am \~95% out. I will sell CSPs over the next weeks at prices I‚Äôm happy to invest at for the long term after the speculative mania subsides. I have 300 Spartan shares still standing tall at this point and wish for us to see true Valhalla‚Äîanother sell at $690.69...and beyond. This is my goal now. One thing I always pride myself on is being transparent and honest. I want you all to know I took life changing profits‚Äîat least my paper and crayons taste good. Plus I can even buy fresh tendies and tip the tendieman! Cheers to all, and may more tendies cometh soon to all my fellow degenerates. -Rod

Without Robinhood, this whole thing probably wouldn't have happened and WSB would likely be stuck at 100k subscribers like it was 3-4 years ago. Because lets face it, a hugee percent of WSB use(d) Robintard because we're too low-functioning to use brokerages that use >4 syllable phrases like ""money market fund"" or ""moving average""

Something like this happening right before going public was **GOLDEN** for them. All they had to do was not be a corrupt sellout bitch, keep their huge influx of new users happy, and they would've been set to come out of this a more respectable, even larger brokerage, as well as a high-value public company.

Instead they decided to expose the raw underbelly of their shitty business model and go exactly against their entire mission statement. Even if capital/margin requirements was the reason for the restrictions (it was definitely a factor but protip: it wasn't the full story), it doesn't change anything about the end result. Who the fuck wants to use a BROKErage who can't guarantee functionality during historical black swan events that usually result in the largest transfer of money? And then, **even if** they can't maintain capital requirements to execute trades, they could have handled it better. Just fucking pull the money from somewhere. Take out a huge loan from somebody ASAP. You can always get instant money if you don't give a fuck about interest rates, which they shouldn't because it's short-term and like I said, it would've been **HUGE** for the future of the company. Another one, they could have restricted both buying & selling of the trending tickers, or just go down altogether (RH users are very familiar with the app being down and losing full functionality, why is this time any different?). Yeah it would've sucked but at least it would've fucking stayed consistent with their mission statement of fair, democratic trading for all. I fuckin work at Wendy's and I can still imagine several better alternatives than the BS ""difficult solution"" they did.

And speaking of their mission statement, it's complete BS. It's just a sugarcoated way of saying ""lol we allow poor people to trade and have pretty colors"". They clearly don't give a shit about DeMoCrAtIzInG tRaDiNg FoR aLl. Because if they did, their business model wouldn't have been a Wall Street megacorp keeping the lights on by frontrunning user trade data.

And yeah another reason why ""volatiilty"" and ""trade volume"" excuses are BS is because they **increased** restrictions on Friday when both volume and negativity **decreased** lmfao. Screw this POS sham company.

Enjoy!

TLDR
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄGME but will lead to üìâüìâüìârest of market 

Most hedge funds take full advantage of the leverage allowances given to them by federal regulators. Current regulation allows them to be up to 30x leveraged as long as their overall position is net neutral. This means for very $1 in their fund they can be $15 short and $15 long because the leverage is assumed to be canceled out back to zero since the fund is equally long/short, hence: net neutral. 

So, the following is what happens when you get a black swan event where mania is rampant in the markets in the form of a large number of investors actively trying to squeeze stocks with high short floats:

It's important to understand that most of the time, the stocks with the highest floats have high short floats because it's where the smart money is collectively shorting. There are currently ~20 companies with short floats comprising 35% or more of outstanding shares.

When hedge funds and RIAs who are net neutral but fully leveraged, see a ton of their shorts being threatened by a potential squeeze, they logically decide to close some of their short positions to prevent heavy, cascading losses.

What happens next? Hedge Fund A has $1b of real, non-levered, capital. They took on $30b of leverage and shorted $15b worth of companies while longing $15b worth of companies, an equal ratio because, by law, they have to remain net neutral if they take on leverage. So, Hedge Fund A decides to de-risk in the face of this black swan event threatening all of its shorts at once by closing, let's say 30% of their short position, so $5b. Now they‚Äôre $10b short and $15b long on $1b worth of real, non-levered capital. In order to comply with regulation they now have to cut $5b of their long position as well. What do they sell? Outperforming blue chips that are heavily liquid like Tesla which is up over 1000% since January 2020 and other names like it that are also up 10-30% in 2021 alone seem like a good place to book profits. So broader market indices start to feel the pain.

I think for this reason, if the wsb short squeeze trend of buying heavy short floated stocks continues, we‚Äôll likely see markets pullback in February as most of the speculative retail money gets deployed. This isn‚Äôt the way people thought we‚Äôd see a 10-15% pullback in the markets, but a correction was probably needed, and this is one way of how it might manifest. 

So when Feb comes as long as no negative covid/vaccine news comes out, make sure to have some cash on the side so you can BTFD. /end rant

And it's fairly valued. Gamestop consistently brings in [revenue of around 8 billion per year](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/revenue). And even with all the pandemic shutdowns it brought in 6 billion in 2020. Fair market value should at least be $100 a share at 8 billion. If it seems high now, it's only because it was massively undervalued before.

Now we're coming out of the pandemic. Gamestop has new leadership. The whole world is watching and millions of retards are buying in anger. And it's only at $300 after multiple counts of manipulation and shorting. Gamestop has plenty more potential to run. It can pivot to new online business models. Revenue should be much higher due to re opening and essentially free advertising and news coverage. People will continue to buy and hold.

There's no reason GME can't display the same price movement as TSLA, which went up and up, and if it didn't go up  it stayed sideways. The shorts lost on TSLA and they will lose here. Don't try to anticipate the GME crash because if we all hold strong there simply won't be one. Let's get this sucker to 100 billion market cap and more importantly, hold the price steady as we get there.

**tldr; GME is fairly valued at $300, potential to keep going, I want it to mirror TSLA price movement**"|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001644.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'TSLA']|['GME', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'GME', 'GME', 'TSLA']

&#x200B;

In 2018, a not so small foreign exchange company called Interactive Brokers was fined $5.5 million for their involvement in the naked short selling of stocks *thousands* of times. They are a company with a market cap of $26.2 billion. **That is nothing for a company their size.**

&#x200B;

Or, look at JPMorgan. They have a market cap of $392 billion. They were fined $920 million last year for price manipulation. **That is nothing for a company their size.**

&#x200B;

So far, Melvin and others have lost billions on their short positions, and could loose an ungodly amount more if/when the squeeze comes.

&#x200B;

So if you don't think that they would risk millions in fees to prevent **billions** in losses, then you must be joking.

&#x200B;

**This is why it is so important that we HOLD and do not buy into their tactics.**

&#x200B;

* No matter how far it falls, do not sell, as it is them manipulating the price.
* Don't trust the media on this. They have just as much riding on this as Melvin.
* Use Fidelity or Vanguard. Robinhood and others WILL screw you when things get rough for Melvin.

(Edit: My statement of ""Don't use robinhood"" seems to have mislead some people. If you own stock on Robinhood, hold it. Do not transfer either. However if you want to buy more, the best thing to do is use another broker.)

As many newcomers to this subreddit are completely in the dark about strategy, I wanted to write a nice fable in order to better explain and motivate my new HOMO sapien brothers.

A purely fictional account potentially based on real-life occurrences;

**THE GORILLA ENDGAME**

Imagine a world in which we are a collective group of 100 Gorillas. We Gorillas hold a stockpile of 100 water bottles. We'll call it a ""Stock"" of water bottles. Water bottles that are essential to the survival of another species, we'll call them Homo-Faggy Monkeys (HFMs). There are \~150 HFMs, clearly not enough water bottles for each and every single one of them. These HFMs have run out of water, but yet don't want to pay the market price of our water bottles. 

In fact, they decided that they'll tell all the other Chimps, Neanderthals, Baboons, C-orangutans (CNBC) that they don't even need water anymore. They've evolved past the necessity of water (even though NO clear evidence on any water-tracking source can confirm this news).

Some Gorillas are a bit worried - if they don't need water, will I ever make a profit if I sell my water bottle? If I sell now, maybe I can secure my water bottle profit, and the last Gorilla with a water bottle might lose his initial money instead. This is exactly what the HFMs want, for the Gorillas to relinquish their supply of water bottles, based on a false narrative that the HFMs have disseminated.

However, if you look at the REAL matters of fact in this great Ape story, the rest of the water on the market is starting to dry up. The great watering holes - we'll call them SPY, DOWJ, and NSDQ for short - are starting to shrivel up. The HFMs are still consuming water! They HAVE NOT EVOLVED, and still are desperate for water. In fact, they're drinking MORE water trying to convince themselves (and the great Gorillas) that they don't need water!

Because here is the real alternative. At some point, the weaker HFMs will face an existential crisis. They NEED water. They cannot survive the cost of not having water for another day. Reluctantly, the weak and smaller HFMs must capitulate and purchase the first water bottle. Now, with less water bottles available (as the 1st weak HFM has consumed the first), the SECOND weakest HFM must purchase the 2nd water bottle at a higher price (more scarcity, and the price floor was set by the 1st HFM). The second HFM can't afford to survive without water any longer. One by one, the dominos fall. Each succeeding HFM must pay a higher and higher price. Finally, the LAST water bottle in the possession of the Gorillas is purchased at the HIGHEST price, because there is scarcity in water bottles, there are more HFMs in this water war than there are actual water bottles.

So you see, the longer the Gorillas can HOLD ONTO THE WATER BOTTLES, the higher the price the water bottles get. In fact, if the Gorillas hold onto the water bottles longer, the LAST Gorilla gets the most money, because the last HFM is existentially compelled to purchase it, at whatever price.

So you see, this is not a ponzi scheme of water bottles. You're not fighting other Gorillas over making the most profit on your water bottles. All Gorillas must know that there are more HFMs than Gorillas. They pay a price each and every day they don't have a water bottle. At some point, one weak HFM will have to buy at whatever price. Then all the HFMs will have to buy at whatever price. And the last Gorilla with the last water bottle gets the MOST money.

\---

If you enjoy my purely fictional story regarding Apes, please share so that the newer Apes in the subreddit understand the REAL picture. That Gorillas are under no threat if they do not sell their water bottles early. And in fact, the last Gorilla makes the most profit on their water bottles.

I'll spice up this story with some eye-catching emojis.

When was the last time you heard the word ""omnichannel""? LOL, it's probably only been like a week but damn, the last week has felt like it has taken years off of my life.

My question is this, should GME capitalize on the moment and issue shares to be able to truly set themselves up for the long term? Imagine if they issued enough shares to make a sizable acquisition like Steam? That would truly give them a serious foothold in the PC gaming industry.

Thoughts? 

Anyways, GME to the moon baby! Hold Hold Hold.

The culture is unmatched, it cuts, it burns, we bleed, all while also picking everyone up with an unwavering acceptance of possibly the most retarded, autistic group of people in the world. 

I happen to belong in this group, although I‚Äôm not the most prominent, I too pass on 2k% gains when presented with the opportunity to loose 99.7%
It hurts but it‚Äôs funny, and is what gives me the feeling of belonging. 

So what I came here to ask tonight, is has anyone actually considered the long term effects of this beautiful thing that is happening??

Specifically for Gamestock itself. I can‚Äôt read, so I don‚Äôt know whether the company was in legitimate trouble as they were being valued as being in a death spiral.... but this has changed the game..

Can anyone pin down exactly how much free advertising they have/are getting? They are literally on the front page of newspapers, on every news station, people are buying damn BILLBOARDS for this!
All the while, they have yet they have yet to even make a statement... why would they? 

Can anyone put a value on they cost of capital for them right now? 

What if they decide to take a page straight out of the FUD playbook and fire that printing press up throwing out them new shares!? They could literally issue enough new shares and raise enough money at the current price to have taken themselves private at the previous valuation (250mil) while still not providing the shorts enough shares to cover. 

AND THEN WHAT!?  
With all this free cash and an unprecedented amount of free media they now have a chance to make BIG plays, inevitably raising their real intrinsic share value.... you know what happens then

So all of a sudden when their shares have a FAIR MARKET value of $150... with LUDICROUS amounts of media the FAIR MARKET value is no longer the MARKET VALUE, so shares now trade for $300 REAL MARKET VALUE

I‚Äôm also retarded considering I was wrong about the gamma squeeze on Friday. I was under the impression all brokerages would allow unlimited buying of GME, but Robinhood kept lowering the amount you could buy. (I feel that if brokerages didn‚Äôt continue blocking buying of shares I would have been right) 

Quick side note if you have a call contract for GME I believe you can exercise it and exceed the purchasing limit for shares.( They may not change that before Monday) 


Ok now on to the main point what does zero liquidity mean? It‚Äôs essentially the fact that for GME there is close to no sellers at this point. Everyone who has their shares are holding on tight to them, so people who need to buy shares like shorts are forced to pay the price the seller chooses. With little to no one wanting to sell shares there is almost no competition between sellers trying to ask less than their competitors. This means that people are able to sell at far higher prices than if the stock was liquid. 

Zero liquidity is very good for us because we can could sell at the prices we name, and when people are forced to buy they might buy almost about any price. There were shares sold at 2,400 while it was trading below 500$. Just think about that when it‚Äôs trading at 2k. There is also still 121% float that means that ever single one of us will be able to exit our positions when shorts cover, and their will still be people buying after we have exited. This isn‚Äôt counting any new shorts who are ballsy and try to time the top at their own peril. 

How do we know that we are close to zero liquidity? We can observe that by the actions of market participants, and by some other things such as the bid -ask spread. There have been moments where the bid- ask spread was over a 1,000$ difference in price. This means that the lowest price someone was willing to sell at was far higher than the current market price of a security. There was a fill allegedly for a 2,400$ sell this week which means that, it was the lowest price available in the market. The bid - ask difference has also peaked out of the cracks a few times, which must have been infuriating for shorts showing that no one was falling for their scare tactics. This is in  addition to a vast reduction in volume throughout the duration of the squeeze so far. 

Institutions have also been limiting the amount of shares you can buy which is very telling that things are very bad right now. The brokerages are doing this knowing full well that they will lose clients and their reputation over this, but are under so much pressure from outside forces that they do this anyway. There have also been less and less short attacks with all the stop losses already being triggered by previous attacks, and the fact they are next to useless if no one will sell at the low prices. 

Something that bodes will for our positions is also that there is big money on our side as well. There a lot of funds that have entered the fray looking for the legendary returns this has the potential to pull off. Institutions and whales recently have done a lot to save our ass recently and patch the holes that shorts were poking in our boat. While retail has had limited buying abilities they have been buying up as many remaining shares as they can get their hands on. There‚Äôs also the added fact of some HFT on our side buying shares on the short ladder attack and exerting heavier tolls on shorts. Some big money being on our side + public support + billionaires (Cuban, Elon, Burry, etc) and some politicians like AOC and Ted Cruz all decrease the chance of the SEC intervening and screwing longs over. 

Remember this though while the institutions and funds want the price to go up and are on our side as of now. They are no better than Melvin our interest are just aligned momentarily they will screw you if they make more money. 

I believe there is some undiagnosed systemic risk at play as well. If funds are forced to cover at prices above 1k they are going bankrupt but will still be forced to cover their positions. My understanding of this is that if a fund doesn‚Äôt have enough capital to meet an obligation their broker is forced to step in and take the loss. Think of it like margin for a retail trader, if you sell box spreads and have 1k of collateral but take a 1mil loss the broker takes the loss while you are force to pay them back at a later date. What if you go insolvent though? Well the brokers stuck holding that loss until they are paid back if they ever are paid back. That‚Äôs in addition with Robin Hood needing to raise an additional 1billion dollars likely as additional collateral. 

Ok what to do with this information? If the prices are to high when they are forced to cover some institutions might be completely liquidated in addition to others that partially liquidate their holdings. I believe this will cause selling across the entire market when this happens. So some SPY puts placed a few weeks out might yield high profit when the squeeze happens as institutions sell to free up more capital. Just look at previous action on SPY as GME price rises dramatically. If you wanted to do some research you could probably find the bankruptcy candidates and their most held assets, and make some intelligent plays, but I‚Äôm already all in GME so I‚Äôm not going to bother.

If the shorts supposedly closed on Wednesday, why would they sell off their shares in the rest of the market on Thursday and Friday? Clearly the play is to close some of their other positions in the hopes that the overall market downtrend would drive GME down. Well unfortunately for them, they underestimated the diamond hands of WSB and we finished in the GREEN on Friday, putting every single 1/29 option that was written before Wednesday ITM. If you look at the charts, SPY dropped JUST as GME turned around in the market. This means that the funds knew that they would have to close out on Monday and raised their cash positions on Friday near close.

70m shorted shares at $300 a piece is $21b. On Friday, according to the order books, just $50m would had raised the stock to over $700. Take it as you will as to what the real squeeze target is.

You don't want to mix high emotions and the stock market no matter what the circumstances are. The Wallstreetbet community which has now seen its membership grow exponentially is now filled with emotionally charged language, emojis and high morale as they draw first blood from the hedge funds. They are now rallying the entire world to ""fight their cause"" by jumping into the stock. Maniac investing, sky rocketing prices, emotions, FOMO, irrationality, bubble anyone?

Financial strains are appearing in the system. Robinhood drew down all their credit lines and raised 1 billion with existing investors. Although we didn't hear from Etrade, TD Ameritrade or Interactive Brokers, we expect them to face similar stress as evident by their share trading restriction. Back in 2015, the surprise announcement by Swiss National Bank to remove the 1.20 EURCHF peg caused massive volatility that led to the insolvency of fx brokers. Brokers are built to function with certain volatility assumptions and things are fine 99.999% of the time until a Black Swan shows up. Brokers are important clogs in the stock market mechanism and they cannot afford to fail in unison. Short brokerages appear to be a good trade here.

It may not stop with GME. GME is now $320, up  10x from the beginning of the year. Mob investors who missed the boat already have other targets in their crosshairs; AMC, Express, Bed Bath Beyond and Blackberry. This will further exacerbate the problem. 

Hedge funds, the villains of the industry have their fair share of failures in their storied past, but non as humiliating as this. Weak, vulnerable retail investors came to the realisation that, when well orchestrated in a community, they can take on these giants and beat them at their game. But hedge funds also serve an important role in price discovery and their sheer magnitude of their operation are a systemic risk to the markets. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a 3.6b bailout of LTCM in 1998 to prevent a wider collapse of the financial system. Indeed, in the 2008 subprime crisis, the suspension of 2 BNP hedge funds in the summer of 2007 also marked the precipice of the crisis before things start to unravel."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001646.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['FOMO', 'TD', 'URCHF', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'LTCM', 'BNP']|['GME', 'GME', 'AMC']

However, you are allowed to talk to lawyers if you're comfortable doing that and I have personally favorably resolved several financially significant disputes with large corporations have tried to take advantage of me in a very formal way.  

I'd never recommend that to anybody.  It's very scary.  But I can share how I get my ducks in a row when it feels like things are going off the rails so you have that information should you ever need it.

I just saw the post about an error in accessing Robinhood statements, which apparently may be required to transfer assets.  I assume that is the case since Fidelity has this bullet point as the first in their transfer steps FAQ:

**""A statement from your current firm to reference""**

While this may be a temporary technical problem they have lost credibility.  There are already pending class actions from the trading outage that have been posted.  There will be more if they continue to have problems.  I'm sure the nature of those problems, benign or otherwise will come to light through these processes.

If they liquidated your positions without knowledge or consent they provided the evidence for you on that one.  But there could be other issues where it cannot hurt to establish you were trying to do where it could be less concrete.

So I don't know what else might go down, but I think a lot of people like me are done and will move everything out.  I hope it goes smoothly, but just in case you are worried here are the steps I usually take when I feel like a large company is going to violate any kind of agreement or fail in an important process. 

Your level of exposure and confidence may dictate how deep you go on this, but it's my full freight exercising my rights as a customer path.

1. As soon as you hit something that caused you a problem make a screenshot.  Do it again and make another screenshot.  If it involves some actual transaction execution make a screenshot of whatever you are trying to trade

2. Send a customer service ticket with a LOT of detail.  What you were trying to do, what went wrong, anything relevant to the details of the transaction.  Take a screenshot before you send.  It goes without saying, but keep all this stuff organized and in one place

3. Get a Google Voice or similar service number.  You can call yourself and start recording and then call customer service.  When you call be very nice.  The person you are talking to is just like you and mostly they deal with morons who forgot their password.  Tell them you are recording.  If you are angry tell them, but don't BE angry.  I can't stress that enough.  Tell them you sent the support ticket.  Repeat all the details.  I have sent recordings to lawyers on the other side before.  They do the trick.  I have sat in a room with a whole senior management team and several corporate lawyers on the phone and called their bluff when they said they had recordings of me indicating I wanted something other than what I got.  I just kept telling them to play it until they suddenly didn't think it needed to come to that and we started talking what we could do to fix it

4. Call back and do it again.  See if you get the same answer.  Having two employees tell me the exact same thing after the company did the exact opposite to me has paid off before

5. Write this stuff down in order as you do it.  Make sure you have names right.  Ask for best call back numbers, resolution times, any promised restitution (that's also why the recordings), and additional ticket numbers that get opened.  If you have a log it's easy to go back and say X agent told me Y on this day and I can send you the recording in 5 minute

6. Go download all those customer agreements you have to plow through.  Send more tickets and ask them to confirm those are the versions that you agreed to when opening the account or the last update you agreed to.  If policies are changing rapidly it does not hurt to to have a record of what the expectation was.  This is really boring, but who knows

7. If you can get to statements go ahead and save the most recent at least.  If a platform goes down you want to have your account info handy

I hope you don't need any of this and someone can give you some more tips.  However, before rage quitting if something does negatively impact you get organized."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001646.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'LOT', 'BE', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'X', 'Y', 'I', 'I']|['Y']

\- ""Silver Short Squeeze"" (fuck off, clearly trying to bait money away from BANG)

\- Sundial Growers

\- Inovio Pharmaceuticals (fuck pharma stocks)

\- Ford (?)

\- A certain currency (Was pumped and dumped, already over now)

\- Literally any other fucking stock

\- This includes the clowns telling people to buy LEVI and MAC **ü§°ü§°ü§°**

\- Saying the ""GME short squeeze is over"" (It isn't over, it never happened)

\- Saying Melvin Capital closed their short position (No they didn't, short interest is still at >100%)

**I also saw a lot of comments about buying in, and which broker to use. I am not offering financial advice.**

\- GME is the only one that has >100% short interest.

\- Hold as long as it takes for the short squeeze to happen. No one knows when it will happen.

\- If you need to find a broker, use this list: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend\_gme\_thread\_homework\_for\_all\_lets\_stop/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/)

l94t1a||$NOK is almost certainly a plant. $GME is the most mechanically likely to squeeze, followed by $AMC and $BB|t3_l94t1a|0.77|65|65|hot|2021-01-31 07:46:24.000000|hardwaresofton|56|DD|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l94t1a/nok_is_almost_certainly_a_plant_gme_is_the_most/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l94t1a/nok_is_almost_certainly_a_plant_gme_is_the_most/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l94t1a/nok_is_almost_certainly_a_plant_gme_is_the_most/|"Sup retards, I rejoined to try and warn you all of the market crash last week thursday, and none of my posts and comments got through, not sure if this will either. 

I'll keep it short and sweet. $NOK is almost certainly a fucking plant, meant to bait you all into buying.

- High float, low price, perfect for retail to pile into
- It's not shorted much at all
- People only started mentioning it *very* recently last week. Out of the non-GME recent meme stocks ($AMC, $BB, $NOK), it's the most recent.
- Retail has gotten fucked on $NOK in the past
- The 5G thesis is great, but it's old fucking news

But OK, all the stuff above is more or less conjecture, let's assume I'm 100% wrong as an unreformed üåàüêª (still think that market crash is coming BTW), here's some signal [take another look at the stocks that Robinhood has restricted and how severe the restriction is](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) (as of 1/30):

| Symbol | Allowed Share purchases | Allowed Option Purchases |
|---|----|---|
| $GME | 1 | 5 (minimum of any of them) |
| $AMC | 1 | 10 |
| $BB | 1 | 10 | 
| $NOK | 5 | 10 | 

Which one of these is not like the other? $NOK is basically the least restricted (on both dimensions). I'm personally not super convinced on $BB either but meh.

Just like most other posts on WSB, this is not financial advice. Make your own investment decisions and know when to sell, because when the squeeze ends it will end fast -- make sure you and your friends talk about and exit strategy, we want to sell into Melvin, Citadel, and their friends, not each other. Once liquidity hits zero it would be great if someone started a count of how many shares were bought at the elevated prices.

I will echo something I read in another post here -- for all the 4MM new people here, **WSB LOSES MONEY ON AVERAGE**. We post and celebrate loss porn. $GME is the only safe bet right now, it will be green even in a sea of red because what's happening right now is mechanical, assured. The shorts have not completely covered yet, and they will. It's not about fundamentals, it's not about technicals, it is market mechanics.

[EDIT] People in the comments suggesting I haven't been on this sub long enough to understand why each individual stock is squeezing. Let me lay it out (please let me know if I'm wrong) so people stop suggesting that

- $GME rocketed because short squeeze + gamma squeeze
- $AMC rocketed because short squeeze + gamma squeeze + recent 900M cash infusion, Bankruptcy is 100% off the table
- $BB rocketed because of optimism around security, lack of compromise in Solarwinds
- $NOK rocketed because 5G, and some idea of being under valued (this one I admit I don't understand)

Shut the fuck up about it. If you know the above this post isn't for you.

This post exists to *dispel the fiction that half of these are legitimate short and/or gamma squeezes*. If you thought that $BB and $NOK were short squeezes, YOU ARE WRONG. They *MIGHT* gamma squeeze but certainly not with the restrictions on them."|2021-01-31 00:16:30.799623|../output/raw/2021/01/31/StockTicker_001646.csv|StockTicker|['$NOK', '$GME', '$AMC']|['NOK', 'GME', 'AMC']|['I', '$NOK', 'GME', '$AMC', '$BB', '$NOK', 'G', 'OK', '$GME', '$AMC', '$BB', '$NOK', '$NOK', '$BB', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'MM', 'WSB', 'LOSES', 'MONEY', 'ON', '$GME', 'I', '$GME', '$AMC', 'M', '$BB', '$NOK', 'G', 'I', 'I', '$BB', '$NOK', 'YOU', 'ARE', 'WRONG']|['NOK', 'GME', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'GME', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'NOK']
