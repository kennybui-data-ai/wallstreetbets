We've got so many comments and submissions that we can't possibly even read them all, let alone act on them as moderators. We wrote software to do most of the moderation for us but that software isn't allowed to read the Reddit new feed fast enough and submit responses, and the admins haven't given us special access despite asking for it.

We're suffering from success and our Discord was the first casualty. You know as well as I do that if you gather 250k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad. That room was golden and the people that run it are awesome. We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you don't get to hang out with your friends anymore. Discord did us dirty and **I am not impressed with them destroying our community** instead of stepping in with the wrench we may have needed to fix things, especially after we got over 1,000 server boosts. That is pretty unethical.

To add to this, people are co-opting our name on twitter. I won't mention their accounts, but lots of handles with ""wsb"" and ""wallstreetbets"" in them are pretending to speak for us. They're saying things that we don't agree with, driving traffic to derivative communities and shitty pixelated merch stores, and generally making it harder for us to define who we are. There's also too much political bullshit in a community that was never *ever* political. The only way I want to occupy Wall St is in a suit myself or rent-free in the mind of a blown up short.

That is why I'm throwing my support behind the Twitter handle in general. We need a way to PUBLICLY reach out to the staff of the infrastructure that is failing us so the world can see that we aren't doing anything wrong here if they don't respond. We need to be able to respond directly to a reporter that is lying to the world about our clubhouse. We can't be expected to meet any expectations when we aren't given the tools we need.

That's not to say I approve of every message or will even be in the loop for all of them, but it's clear to me we can't do nothing and we need a megaphone.

**http://twitter.com/wsbmod** aka **@wsbmod** is the only Twitter handle whose statements are directly from some part of the team.

We'll do our best not to pretend to speak for you, but to try to speak with the volume our name now seems to command to get shit done for us."|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212609.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'LICLY', 'I']|[]

The situation here is delicate. Obviously, with the deletion of discord due to ToS violations, the moderators here are dealing with an existential threat to our community.

While in the past, automated moderation using bots has been effective for dealing with human users violating the WSB sub ToS, I think a has been reached where the quantity AND quality of posts, primarily by bot accounts, has likely overwhelmed our moderator resources.

Please remember that moderators on reddit are unpaid volunteers. They are likely working on a way to:

1. Prevent bots from creating ridiculous quantities of noise. The community up and downvoting system doesn't work when there are endless bots able to downvote posts by non-bot accounts. Similarly, even with eliminating accounts to those registered in the past 45 days, people have been sitting on thousands, potentially millions, of accounts that were registered in the past, purely in case there was a need to obfuscate legitimate content and concerns. This has been a tactic used by nation-states for other websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and more. I don't see why powerful groups wouldn't employ this tactic as well.
2. Refresh the rules surrounding WSB etiquette. I know you all like to say ""retarded"" and such, but I've seen a huge quantity of copypasting, misinformation, low-effort/quality, and often highly abusive posts in this sub now. These can be grounds for taking down this subreddit, and we need to evolve from that.
3. Work with Reddit to identify how to safely operate and manage this subreddit. The traffic to this sub is creating enormous strain on Reddit itself. As Reddit is a private company, they have to consider the interests of all other communities here in addition to WSB. The influx of bot traffic is causing performance bottlenecks site-wide.

So, remain calm. Trust in our moderators. Try not to spout any meme's or offensive material, and check back in later. They will find a solution.  


Edit3: I have been advised that content moderation is 100% an unpaid role and reddit moderators are not allowed to solicit donations, updated post to reflect that. Thanks.

EDIT EDIT: Friends, I appreciate your love and I know the moderators do as well. Take care of yourselves and be kind to one another. This community is special.. in several ways, I hope we all reach the moon.

EDIT: To clarify, I am not a moderator, but I empathise for their situation as I work in a cybersecurity and content moderation role for a major website as well.

Also, mods, feel free to take this down if you want to write your own explanation. I understand this situation is quite stressful for you all."|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212609.csv|StockTicker|['A']|[]|['S', 'WSB', 'S', 'I', 'AND', 'I', 'WSB', 'I', 'WSB', 'I', 'EDIT', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['S', 'S']

When social media is allowed to willynilly try to stop us from talking. And be so fucking blatant about it? Really hate speech going on for months but today is the day you decide to dismantle our communication?  Doesn't really sound like you give 2 shits about hate speech if according to your own words let it go on for so long.  Sounds like they are un-American fucks tarnishing the spirit of free speech to enrich themselves.

But keep the following in mind...|t3_l6eqqu|0.99|11719|11719|hot|2021-01-28 00:25:53.000000|o0DrWurm0o|482|Discussion|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6eqqu/people_will_try_to_gaslight_you_into_believing/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6eqqu/people_will_try_to_gaslight_you_into_believing/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6eqqu/people_will_try_to_gaslight_you_into_believing/|"Inevitably, there will be a smear campaign led by certain organizations and media members against retail traders who are getting in on $GME. One argument that will be made is that it's not fair that we made so much money by recognizing that a group of hedge funds and institutions were in over their heads. It hurts the market and we should feel bad for exploiting them.

The total market cap of $GME is around $12B as I'm writing this. **The total market cap of Wall Street is around $50T.** That means we've currently displaced about .025% of the total value of the US stock market. I will type that out to reiterate: we (retail traders) have displaced approximately one quarter of one tenth of one percent of the total market cap. To claim that we are doing anything which is tremendously harmful to the whole market is absolutely pants-on-fire lies. Is this going to change some elements of the market moving into the future? Almost certainly. But even if this stock goes to $1000 per share, we are still only talking about less than one tenth of one percent of the total market cap that's out there. 

If you're looking at your RH balance right now  and thinking ""wow, that's a lot of money, am I doing something wrong? Illegal, even?"" the answer is **ABSOLUTELY NOT.** What you are beginning to notice is that the wealth gap in this country is absolutely massive. Thousands upon thousands of people could make year changing or life changing money out of this squeeze and it'll hardly be a blip on Wall Street's radar. Greed is absolutely out of control at the top and this funny little news story is tangible proof of that. Do not let them gaslight you into thinking that it's wrong for you to get a slightly larger sliver of the pie. 

Good luck to everyone playing this. I've got 100 shares at a cost basis of $103.95. I might not make millions, but I might be able to make a dent in my student loans, or pay off my car, or something that makes me just a little more hopeful that I'll be able to live some sort of ""American Dream"" before I'm old and wrinkled.

edit: and in the event that you're literally brand new to trading (we're getting a lot of new people here), I would highly encourage you to read up on investment basics (there are literally millions of resources on this) and do some research into $GME and why it's moving the way it is. I would not recommend taking a position on any stock if you can't articulate your own reason as to why you're invested in it."|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212609.csv|StockTicker|['$GME']|['GME']|['$GME', '$GME', 'B', 'T', 'US', 'I', 'RH', 'I', 'UTELY', 'NOT', 'I', 'I', 'I', '$GME', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'B', 'T', 'RH', 'GME']

*****[Edit 6: YES MELVIN COULD HAVE CLOSED WITH PUTS BUT IF THEY DIDNT CLOSE AT ALL THIS IS CRAZY]*****

I’m in the Midwest and am trading in the NYSE. GME options. I have contacted two lawyers that deal with securities fraud and there is a CHANCE they will take us up.

WE COULD MAKE THIS A CLASS ACTION!

My biggest concerns right now is the BLATANT FRAUD Melvin Capital committed this morning at market open with the help on CNBC. Because of their lies about closing their position, after previously saying they do not disclose their holdings to media, the stock dropped more than 9% and triggered a circuit breaker giving large hedge funds and investors the opportunity to collude or use their super fast computers to make money.

My BIGGEST potential worry though is the SEC halting trading and 2+MM autists not being able to close or exercise their options, losing out on MILLIONS in FAILRY made gains. I believe this would be illegal.

We have a decent chance of being a class action suit against MELVIN SHITRON POINT72 (AND THE SEC IF THEY FUCK WITH US).

Please let me know if you’re interested in being apart of a class action lawsuit.

Of course may DADDY Elon bless you, may all your STONKS touch the moon.

Listen, I know it’s been fun, but now it’s time to get serious about what’s about to happen tomorrow. It’s going to get ugly.

MY BROTHERS, HEAR ME OUT. 

Tomorrow. Tomorrow is the DAWN before the new age. We have these sons of bitches on the edge of the ropes. We’re making international news. The richest son of a bitch in the world is tweeting about us. Understand, brothers, that tomorrow is a true test of strength and willpower. We saw LIES by CNBC, we saw EVERY broker app collapse, we saw reporters trying to force the FED to make a comment on GameStops viability and possibly imposing regulations. 

Regulations? For what? The fucking little guy took a bite of the tendies, and now you want to scare us into folding over? 

Listen here you sons of bitches. I’ve been broke all my damn life and I am tired of it. I got people to take care of. My dad drives Uber every fucking day to pay off bills and provide for the family. I’ve worked my ass off through college and grad school. I’m tired of fucking worrying about my financial situation. This is the once in a lifetime opportunity that these trust-fund, Wall Street cock suckers were born into. 

It’s our fucking turn.

BE PREPARED FOR EVERY SINGLE DIRTY TRICK IN THE BOOK TOMORROW. THEY ARE GOING TO TRY AND RATTLE YOU TO YOUR CORE. THEY WANT YOU TO FUCKING PAPER HAND. THEY WANT YOU TO FUCKING SELL. THAT’S BECAUSE THEY FUCKING WANT TO MAINTAIN THEIR STATUS QUO BULLSHIT.

Nah, fuck you. I’m here until we fucking reach the moon.

Weather the storm tomorrow, brothers. GME to 1k by Friday.

EDIT: THEY BANNED OUR DISCORD, THE REDDIT CEO IS GOING ON CNBC TOMORROW, AND THE MARKET IS VOLATILE AS FUCK AFTER HOURS. 

WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN??

I’M NOT FUCKING SELLING.

THE DIP IS GOING TO BE FUCKING PRIME TIME TO BUY. THIS VOLATILITY IS FOR YOU BASTARDS THAT DIDNT GET IN EARLIER. BUY THE FUCKING DIP TOMORROW AND HOLD. DO NOT FUCKING HESITATE. DO NOT LET YOUR EMOTIONS GET TO YOU. THATS WHAT THEY FUCKING WANT. DONT FUCKING PANIC SELL WHEN YOU SEE RED. YOUR BROTHERS WILL BE THERE TO BUY THE DIP AND SHOOT YOU TO GREEN 🚀🚀🚀🚀

NO MATTER WHAT FUCKING HAPPENS. DO NOT FUCKING SELL. 

IF REDDIT “GOES OFFLINE” - DO NOT FUCKING SELL. 

IF OUR BROKER APPS CRASH -  DO NOT FUCKING SELL

THEY’RE GOING TO FUCKING THROW EVERYTHING AT US TOMORROW BROTHERS.

ALL YOU 🤲💎 FUCKERS HOLD STRONG WITH ME. IM NOT GOING TO THE FUCKING MOON ALONE. I CAN’T DO IT WITHOUT MY BROTHERS.

If investors hold this price it forces the hedge funds to cover (buy it back) at whatever price is available. This causes it to rocket up. This is called a short squeeze.  These big firms do not like being checked like this and will say that it already happened, even though the math doesn't support that yet.

Big Brain Edit:

The market never needed shorts to begin with because they so easily manipulated prices. Throwing millions to bet a stock will go down is shooting fish in a barrel and honest investors see that flat lining price and never invest for anything. Great companies that might have a misstep, or an analysts give a less than rosy view of a company and the stock gets swarmed by shorts and honest investors have to watch their values decimated. Since regulators never addressed it, I'm glad the retail investors is stepping up.

No not at all, what’s happening to GME isn’t a fucking pump and dump scheme. It has actual merit and the price is based on short sellers getting squeezed.

If you want this sub banned after the dust settles then go ahead carry on screaming about the “next pump” or “target”. You won’t get very far before the sec shuts you down for market manipulation. And if you think that’s a pipe dream don’t think for one second that Reddit wouldn’t give your details up, because they would in a heartbeat if a government body asked for it.

Turns out he needed knee surgery that costed $4,000.00. I broke down because I didn't have that much, didn't qualify for the payment plan, and it was either the surgery or wait till his other knee blew out then put him to sleep.

I put all the money I did have in GME around $97/ share & AMC at $4.84 Tuesday morning (a little less than $1k) with an exit plan to get out once I had enough for his surgery. This morning after market open I was able to sell enough to pay for his TPLO surgery! I am in tears and really grateful. Thank you everyone and good luck!

* Where was this shit when WeWork was valued at 50 billion and the CEO was likened to cult leader? 

* Where was this shit when Tesla jumped to the moon?

* Where was this shit when Bill Ackman told everyone “Hell was coming” to profit off of the fear that your children and family were going to die?

EVERYONE called these people geniuses… and what do we get? Suppression. This changes the Thesis. 

We all knew that Gamestop was coming up with a new online retail platform. We knew Cohen was coming up with new ideas to innovate and add material value to the company. Why? Because we fucking read, unlike Wall Street. But now, **the idea of Gamestop is even bigger.** Gamestop has something no other company will ever have.

Think about it. Who here will buy Gamestop from now on? Not the stock, the actual company? How many other people will buy Gamestop knowing they’re fucking over the snakes that try to take advantage of the poor and disenfranchised? I know a lot of people and I sure as well will be that 70 Grandpa telling my kid about brand loyalty and to always support GME. Why? **Because it’s more now.**

If you didn’t hold the original--re-structuring will create material value--thesis, there is no looking away now. Millions of people will support GME. Millions more will convert and buy their products. People will talk about this for hundreds of years. They say the fundamentals don’t make sense, but with all this support from ALL OVER THE WORLD, I think GME will come true on their valuations. 

What does this mean? GME has a value that has never been seen before in the world. GME is now a representation of the fight against corporate interest and Wall Street. People don’t just buy products, they buy the idea of a product and what it represents. Think about all these new Green businesses. Think about Tesla. This is the game changer and the evidence supports it. This validates all the naysayers.

**We haven’t even hit the squeeze yet.** There’s no way this gets taken from us.

Godspeed. I’m holding and buying more.

Edit: We are the perfect storm of funny ""meme-ability"" and real world shit to get real people on our side. Don't forget that. There's something special here and I'm not talking about you retards.

I am not a financial advisor. This is my own opinion and the facts I am aware of, as well as an explanation of my own current positions. 

&#x200B;

Okay, I am going to do my best to explain why everyone should continue to buy and hold GME, even through the weekend, why this is legal, and why as long as everyone keeps buying and holding there is the potential for infinite gains, because a lot of people seem to be getting a little paper handed after hours. (for those of you who don't know, being paper handed means feeling the pressure and caving and selling)

Okay, so our buddies over at Melvin capital messed up big time this time. They, as well as Citron Research and a few other companies, shorted GameStop(GME) big time, expecting it to continue to lose revenue. Now, the problem is, they overshorted GME by about 140%. This means there are a lot more short positions than there are publicly available stocks. Because of this, if you, or I, or anyone reading this, buys a GME stock, that is one less stock for Melvin or Citron to be able to buy back, thus closing their short position and taking their loss.

As long as everyone holds their GME stocks, this demand by Melvin and Citron will continue to drive up the price of GME, and this can go on technically till GME hits $5k, $10k, or even higher, because they can only close their positions once people start selling. No selling, no shorts closing, demand for the stock increases, price goes up even higher. There is no ceiling to this, the power is in your hands to buy and hold.

TL;DR: BUY GME, DELETE SELL BUTTON, PROFIT

“Hey, I just watched a movie about the GameStop squeeze of 2021! Weren’t you in the stock market back then?”

His excitement tries to cut through the field of regret the memory has sparked, but it can’t. 

“I was,” you answer hesitantly. “That was a crazy time.”

“Well, did you trade it? Did you have it when it went to two thousand??”

He’s so giddy it’s almost palpable. You take a sip of coffee before answering.

“Well uh, I was, but sold my shares in the morning after they fell fifty bucks in after hours trading, at two hundred.”

You’ve never seen your son look at you like this before, and hope you’ll never have to again.

“Uh, okay.. bye..” he walks off.

You sigh, closing your eyes.

If not change it.

I wrote this in response to someone elsewhere who asked simply:

> So they're betting against the company? Like, they have no faith in them? Investing like this makes one feel horrible.

Yeah. There are three ways you can short.

--- 

1) You buy an option with a predetermined end date with the RIGHT to sell a stock at a certain price (depending on how much you want to pay determines the price.) If a stock is $10 and you expect it to drop to $5 in 6 months, you might buy a $9, 10 month expiry ""put"" (right to sell at price) option. This might cost you 50c per share. 

IF you're even slightly right, ie it drops to any price lower than $8.49 before expiry you made 1c per share. You can also change your mind and sell the option (either more (profit) or less (loss) than 50c/share).

IF you're properly right, and it does drop to exactly $5 you make $3.5 per share. If it rises, or drops to any number above $8.50, you lose the price of the option (50c/share). 

---

2) You're a big player. You call your buddies at Pension Fund X42 and say ""Hey can I borrow those shares you have for x% interest and return them to you later?"" A set timeframe may be set. I don't know for sure, but probably. Anyhow, Pension Fund X42 says ""ok"" because they aren't looking to sell them, so might as well make some interest on lending them. 

So you borrow them, and immediately sell them. You pay your daily interest to the pension fund, and you wait. When the price drops, and you decide that you've made enough, you buy them back and return them. You keep the difference in prices whatever that may be, minus the interest.

If you're wrong... You're still obliged to return the shares to Pension Fund X42. So at some point you have to decide to eat a loss and buy the shares back. 

---

3) You're a big player and you are ok with a bit of lawbreaking, you Naked Short Sell. This is great because it's cheaper! No interest payments! 

Here, you simply sell shares you don't have, and buy the imaginary shares you just created back later so that the number of shares on issue doesn't get too far out of whack and you don't get investigated. Any gap between your sell price and buy price is profit or loss depending on which way it goes. 

---

What's happened right now is mostly a combination of 2 and 3. I'm sure there is a bit of 1, but 1 only causes predictable losses (Like the cost of playing a hand at a casino. You only lose the amount you bet if the cards don't go your way.)

So the risk with 2 and 3 is that because you're **obliged** to buy back the shares at some point, if they go up, when you have to quit, you have to pay the current market price and your actions can make the price go up even more. 

Now you're in a short squeeze. You are obliged to buy but the price keeps going up every time you do. It's entirely possible that others see the price going up and buy, so you're now competing to buy a limited number of shares with everyone else. So the price goes higher. Your losses are potentially infinite. 

---

**What's slightly different** between this particular short squeeze and all the others is:

---

1) The dumb fucks naked short sold AT LEAST 40% more shares than ever existed. They're obliged to buy back more shares than is possible. The only way out of that self-made trap is a complicated mess of desperately buying, returning, rebuying from the people you borrowed them from, and returning them with losses at every step. Imagine if I sold you 10 cars, but only delivered 6. You're standing there with your wtf face and I say ""Hey! how much would you sell those 4 cars for?"" You can name your price at this point. I pay it. Then I ""finish"" my ""10 car delivery.""

---

2) Retail traders are acting as one single semi-coordinated hive, loosely behaving similarly to what would in prior short squeezes, be a competitor hedge fund. They own a lot of the shares the hedge funds (HFs) NEED to buy - but they're not selling. They're actively cheering for the HFs bankruptcy while watching the price of the stock they hold skyrocket. Only other HF billionaires are allowed to do that and get away with it. 

.

2a) HFs can be negotiated with. If you're really, really getting bent over and fucked, and you grovel enough, you can usually cut a deal where they stop trying to fuck you. If they won't talk to you, they'll often talk to your bank/broker/some other bigger player that can convince them that your bankruptcy will also cause significant losses or bankruptcy of another party they're not trying to fuck and they might like to have as friends one day. ""You quit this, and we'll owe you one."" It's always good to have favours to call.

.

2b) The self proclaimed retards on WSB can't be negotiated with. They don't need favours. They don't care if you go bankrupt or there's collateral damage. They don't give a fuck about any of them. For the most part they only hold a few hundred shares each max - and also for the most part, they're playing with their own money that they can actually afford to lose even if it hurts for a year or two. 

How do you negotiate with, or swat a million wasps stinging you? You can't."|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212609.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['DD', 'I', 'RIGHT', 'IF', 'IF', 'I', 'A', 'I', 'AT', 'LEAST', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'NEED', 'HF', 'WSB']|['DD', 'AT', 'HF']

Disproportionately selling any one of these 2 can cause one of the shares to suddenly collapse and can lead to an influx in the other one.

This is why GME STOCK SHARES are FUNDAMENTALLY FAIR VALUED at 500+.

&#x200B;

**Today on CNBC, the shills and hedge fund puppets were asking ""show me the white papers, to justify the current price of GME. Blah blah blah, show me the FUNDAMENTALS""**

Well, I am going to do just that. Now, there are many ways to value a company, from DCF models only to speculating growth opportunities (PVGO, etc), and while those are somewhat complicated, you're in luck. **You don't actually need to know them**. This is what CNBC is getting wrong, as they are looking INWARD into GME's books looking for a justification for their value. (jk, they're shills, but let's pretend they deserve the benefit of the doubt). They need to be looking at the value of a SHARE as an independent entity - it is no secret we have departed from any type of traditional fundamental valuation. 

&#x200B;

To understand how to fundamentally value GME, we must look to the futures market and their fundamentals, and view GME shares of stock as a commodity. Like many commodities, especially produce  (gourds), steel, oil, etc, there is **one force that drives the entirety of the speculative futures markets: SUPPLY AND DEMAND.**

# SUPPLY AND DEMAND

In the futures market, Fundamental analysts will use their knowledge of supply and demand factors to create their opinion of whether the futures contract is fairly valued, and if price will increase or decrease. that is **exactly what is going on with GME, and why the stock is (and will continue) to go up.**

* The current stock price is not based on the financials of GME, but on the **CONCRETE KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS IMPOSSIBLE DEMAND AND FINITE SUPPLY.**

# Again, the stock price of GME is fundamentally fair valued because of supply and demand (the driving force of commodity futures markets). There is CONCRETE knowledge of IMPOSSIBLE DEMAND, and FINITE SUPPLY.

When speculators have reason to believe that ornamental gourd supply will be very low and middle aged white women will be itching to get their hands on some to make their kitchen table thanksgiving centerpiece, (aka when supply is very low), they have (good) reason to believe that the price for gourds will be HIGHER THAN NORMAL

This is amplified by the fact that short positions need to pay interest if they do not find supply. Those with short positions will **be killed (through bankruptcy) if they do not cover.**

# What is happening with GME is the same thing that happens when life saving drugs are marked up 100s of %s. People will pay for them because they HAVE TO.

edit: ""don't compare GME to life saving drugs asshole!!11!!!!!!. I am not saying that GME is a life saving drugs, or that GME is more important than insulin, or any other retarded conclusion you smooth brains can jump to. I am saying that as a function of SUPPLY and DEMAND, since DEMAND outweighs SUPPLY, and since there are EXTREME CONSEQUENCES for not HAVING ENOUGH SUPPLY TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND, then PEOPLE WILL PAY EXORBITANT PRICES TO MEET DEMAND

Same goes with food if you're starving, water if you are about to die of thirst, etc. go get offended at something else

&#x200B;

So where is the top? The same place it is for life saving drugs of course: the absolute highest they could be without exhausting the need for supply. (or in layman's terms, the ""I know that you can and will pay for this so that you don't die, even if it means living from paycheck to paycheck."" price.

I am talking brokers having to liquidate their entire market positions because [STOCK BROKERS AND BROKERAGE FIRMS CAN BE HELD LIABLE FOR NEGLIGENCE, and allowing unhedged naked shorting over 100% of TOTAL float is negligent.](https://www.jpfirm.com/news-resources/stockbrokers-and-brokerage-firms-can-be-held-liable-for-negligence/) Obviously, this would destroy the market.

also: I am not saying GME with it's assets + future growth is worth 25bil, I am saying that the shares themselves are fairly valued based soley on supply and demand.

The brokers have given us commission-free trading. Reddit, twitter, etc. have given us a collective hive mind where ideas can be nurtured, critiqued, developed, distributed, and acted upon in concert.

However, the government, hedge funds, brokers, et. al. still practice their dirty tricks to protect their own. We should fear the systematic risk of cronyism within the halls of government and Wall Street to put the brakes on our profit making, which is our lawful American right.

Should the SEC illegally or unjustly intervene on behalf of their friends (who so often reward government poodle regulators with lucrative jobs after leaving civil service), we will need to find a large law firm that specializes in securities and class actions and is willing to setup a trust account where you give your name, nominal retainer fee, and proof that you owned $GME to establish standing in a suit.

2. Everyday they can't cover means they're BLEEDING money due to expensive interest rates they paid to borrow stock.
3. They're getting some help which only means we get more tendies. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS NOT SELL, BLEEDING THEM ALL OUT.  
4. They have their tactics and dirty tricks to trap investors but as long as you know why that's happening you'll be fine.

What a time to be alive. 

 *""Bulls make money, bears make money,* ***pigs get slaughtered****""* 

How ironic, that one of the most iconic sayings in investing, was coined by Wall Street itself. Right now, pigs are getting slaughtered, and crying for someone to blame.

**I want you guys to really think about this:**

Every investment you make, comes with inherit risks and rewards. These hedge funds, who shorted 130%+ of the GME float, took a MASSIVE FUCKING RISK. They beat this stock down to a pulp, and instead of taking out their profits (like bears), they got greedy (like fucking pigs) and continued to increase their short.

They are literally affecting peoples lives. Those who work at Gamestop. They wanted this to go completely bankrupt. Oh, and who's going to bail out the average joe? Who bails out Jim, who works behind the counter at Gamestop?

NO ONE.

But who bails out these hedge funds? Fucking think about it. Melvin Capital gets a 3bn bailout, because they took a HUGE FUCKING RISK, and got caught on the losing end. 

Also, lets talk about risk for a second.

These hedge fund and institutions took a big risk that didnt pan out. Okay, not a big deal. they can just take the L and move on. But no. They doubled down, and you get articles now BLAMING THE RETAIL INVESTOR FOR MANIPULATION. 

So let me ask you this:

1. they took a huge risk on a bet
2. they are losing the bet
3. instead of being on the receiving end of the loss, they blame others for the situation that they're in

If you take a huge risk, and you KNOW that there is a chance of a loss, and that loss occurs, the only reason why you would start blaming others and finding excuses, is because there is an inherit FLAW in the system.

Melvin and other shorts knew, that there was no way something like this could happen. Why? Because they have the instruments to manipulate you and your emotions, through BS articles, analysts, and mass media.

TLDR:

1. Shorts shorted 130%, took a huge risk and lost
2. instead of taking the L, they're blaming YOU for manipulating the market"|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212611.csv|StockTicker|['GME', 'GTFO']|['GME']|['I', 'GME', 'SSIVE', 'CKING', 'RISK', 'NO', 'ONE', 'HUGE', 'CKING', 'RISK', 'L', 'AMING', 'THE', 'ETAIL', 'ESTOR', 'FOR', 'ATION', 'KNOW', 'FLAW', 'BS', 'L', 'YOU']|['GME', 'ONE', 'L', 'FOR', 'L']

I've never been more excited to see others make money while I watched on the side. 

Today, like us all, I've been reading through news. William Gavin, Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, told Barron's we should halt Gamestop for a month to let it cool down because ""small and unsophisticated investors are probably going to get hurt by this.”

The outrage, to attempt to save big money while saying its to protect us. He said we are vulnerable. He said we are too ""unsophisticated"" to understand our risks. He said thay shorts at least are sophisticated. Its so stupid its laughable. As if we are simply children mashing buttons. 

We are adults, with crayons.

So Bill, please tell us how vulnerable we are tomorrow. 


“I think the little guys you describe are probably the ones most likely to get hurt,” he said. “Those that are more sophisticated—who might be shorting—they may get hurt, but they’re more sophisticated. They probably understand the risk they’re taking.”"|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212611.csv|StockTicker|['WSB']|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']|[]

The shorts have only themselves to blame. They were given life lines and extra capital to escape their positions. But instead they use that money and opportunity to double down. 

They call us names and make it seem like we are bandits, when in reality we are your brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles and so on. There is nothing malicious about liking a stock and buying and holding it. 

In fact, CNBC and other outlets encouraged the young generation to start investing and tell us the stock market is the greatest creation of wealth possible. 

But when we do, they don’t like us getting it right. They are the pool sharks at the table and they just want us to play to get our money.

It all starts with Melvin Capital. Who *had* around $13bn in assets. From them
reporting being down over 30% as of Fri 22-1 in the month *overall* we can
deduce that at the time they had a $3.7bn loss. The stock price on the day
before was $43.03.


When the price rallied to the $70s on Fri-21 they were shitting their pants b/c
they were now showing nearly a $6.5bn loss. They called up their buddies
Citadel and Point72 and got $5bn in loans, convinced their brokerage they could
get out of it (to not get liquidated) and started *trying* to illegally
manipulate the market. It didn't work; you retards and whales held. And kept
buying.


As of EOD 1-26 the stock price closed at $150, then to $240 after market. 

Melvin now has as a $13bn loss. This kills the Melvin.

These short positions are now parasitic fuck bombs that will literally
*consume* anyone who is holding it when the dust clears. 

Melvin's brokerages will be liquidating their assets ASAP less *they* get stuck
with them. But here's the fun part...  No one's selling b/c of you degenerates.
But, alas, there's a solution. There are funds like Blackrock who specialize in
[Security Lending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_lending) (see
[securities-lending-viewed-through-the-sustainability-lens.pdf](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/publication/securities-lending-viewed-through-the-sustainability-lens.pdf)).

Turns out, Blackguard owns 13.2% of GME — 11,271,702 shares. And they just
sold 2,054,367 shares to bail someone out for over $400mill. How do we know?
Because of [this SEC
document](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000083423721001340/us36467w1099_012621.txt)
filed *today* (also see [fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme/blackrock)). 

And what happened at EOD today? Price exploded to $240 for a moment as these
got bought. Lines up. This is the smoking gun to signal the action.

At conservative estimates there are at *least* 50,000,000 short positions yet to cover.
Blackrock is their last life line and will only hold out for so long. Once
Blackrock goes it's a fucking free for all. All the shorts who have yet to
cover are fucked. Completely fucked.

At $200, 50,000,000 shares is $10bn. But $10bn is literally GME's market cap.
To get rid of $10bn in GME shorts they'll be at least doubling the price/market
cap, so by the second that $10bn loss is going to be grow, and grow. Doubling,
tripling, quadrupling even.

This is their armageddon. That single $GME short position could completely wipe
them out. That position is a wildfire in their portfolio that can only be
extinguished with *money*.

$1,000? That's a fucking *joke*. They will be *scrambling* to cover, constantly out bidding each other on orders.

# **This could be hitting over $5,000 or more**

I am not fucking kidding. The higher we hold, the higher it goes until the last one
is standing with the -99.999999999999%.

And you wanna know the extra fucking wild thing?

Meta.

Every Brad, Chad, and Susan at BIG HEDGE X Inc that shorted GME are *awake*.

# **They are reading this**

They are scouring and scrutinizing every indicator, every sentiment, every
*post on WSB* they can to decide on what to do. When they see this post?

... It's on.

# When will it start?

Soon.

# How long it will take?

Who knows. 

# How long it will last?

# How long it will go?

I’m here to clear the air on why that isn’t the case. 

The key difference between the two is the short positions. Whilst it’s true that AMC also has a large short interest it is nothing compared to GME. 

What separates GME is the percentage of shorts against the float which is approximately 130%-140%. This meant that short sellers had no where to go when things started to go south for them (I will explain why later).

AMC has a large short interest however it’s approximately 70%, which gives the short sellers a large position to exit (which given the hype surrounding GME is very likely after today). 

Why does this difference matter?

Well with GME, the short sellers have already borrowed shares and are required to buy back those shares at market value when one of the following triggers activates:-

1. They close their position
2. Their margin gets called and they are forced to
3. Their short positions expire

When a trigger activates the amount of shares they borrowed is then purchased at market rate. If the shares aren’t available then price goes up (rapidly) trading is suspended (usually) and this gives time for investors to set a sell price. Rinse and repeat until all shares owed are paid back. 

With GME having more than 100% short interest this means that stock is going to have to change hands numerous times to pay back the investors. During this period the stock price will be huge and there will be many trading stops. All of the money for this price increase will be coming from the short sellers and htere can be no bag holders (unless you really are retarded) because the stock is being returned to the original investor and they were paid interest by the short sellers anyway so they can’t complain. 


With AMC, there is a large window for short sellers to exit and therefore cannot be squeezed as hard. Smart short sellers will be closing their positions today or after today causing a pump (because they are buying shares to close their positions). The recirculated GME hype investment will also cause a pump and with no end game squeeze in sight the stock will be left floating in a bubble. Which will eventually pop leaving many retail investors as bag holders. 

You cannot squeeze every short position in the market. GME is special because the institutions taunted us and exposed themselves by being reckless. It won’t happen again. You aren’t squeezing anyone but yourselves in AMC. Be at your own risk. 

TLDR: GME squeeze is real, AMC squeeze is fictional.

I’ve been a member for over a year now, and seeing the huge influx of people (and massive media attention) made me realize that you all are  the ones who are having to keep this thing under control. We are in some crazy times over here at WSB and I know you all have been work overtime on here and it’s for free. I hope I speak for all of wsb when I say we truly appreciate the work you all put in. I also want to add that if there is a full blown attack on this sub, that you all can lead us out of it. I know it’s a lot to ask for but hell, half of us can’t read or write. We need you guys and even if we do get spammed with some bullshit posts from 2 month old bots, I’m okay with that as long as you guys can keep this sub up and running. This place feels like home and it’s brought a lot of good into a crazy world right now. The GME train will eventually end when it reaches Pluto, but I need this sub to continue on. I need the loss porn of someone who maxed out their credit cards and yoloed it at the top just like I need the gain porn of a teenager who helped pay for a new roof. WSB is bigger than a sub on Reddit, its a beacon of hope in a dark world and I think with blood, sweat, tears, cocaine, and autism this place is going to change a lot people’s lives.

EDIT2: Positions: GME SHARES BABY

&#x200B;

Disclaimer: Not a financial advisor, just a guy who likes stocks. I have been in and out of GME since begining of December 2020.

Another disclaimer -- A lot of institutional money is going long, this is not a way to get back a Wall St. in general but as Jim Cramer put it ""the pigs"" Those who are shorting more shares of a stock then there are on the exchange.

But this doesn't matter to us, we like the stock and most of us are buying it because of that.

I would check out [https://youtu.be/fHtBkxEeUtU](https://youtu.be/fHtBkxEeUtU)

&#x200B;

1. The short squeeze has not even happened yet

We all already knew this, but this is a reminder: You have not missed out... yet

Shorts will eventually have to close their positions when they run out of money.

If $GME can go past 400-500 then I'd say it's incredibly likely that shorts get squeezed.

&#x200B;

2) On Friday, 42% of the float will be bought by market makers who sold call options

This will cause the price of GME to go WAY up.

&#x200B;

3) Shorts are losing money at such a rate that within the next few weeks the short squeeze will happen

&#x200B;

We aren't causing this directly... you buying is picked up by an algorithm with much more cash. It's like a megaphone, a megaphone that can send you to the fucking MOON! But still make sure to buy, without you the algorithms have nothing to pick up on.

&#x200B;

Don't own options on these anymore. They are getting too expensive. I sold all of my options and went in on shares simply because the extrinsic value of the options are too high to buy in at this point. GME options aren't even going up more then 300% at this point when the stock is going up 200%. Most options don't even move at all. It's simply much less risk for a little less gains. HOLD and get rid of the limit sells. You're helping shorts box in the price.

&#x200B;

Also:

A) $1000 is not a meme

    When they have to close their shorts once we've held, we can sell to them at ANY price we want. We can always sell to shorts at a higher price.

B) How $1000 share price will help Gamestop perform a comeback, and why it's not overvalued in the long run

With Ryan Cohen alongside RC Ventures, GameStop is starting a comeback. With a $1000 share price GameStop could sell some more shares lets say 100,000 (The max ammount of shares they can issue @ 1000 without redoing an SEC doc) \[ u/TheHighOrder helped point this out\] (0.213% of float) the share price would only go down 0.213%, which would likely be counteracted by much better earnings. This would raise $100,000,000.00 in capital. They could use this on new staff, new branches or a massive ad campaign with quality like the ads from the 90s to the 2010s (really good) that will get people acting and going down to GameStop. This could cause GameStop to maybe do a full turn around.

&#x200B;

So in all... tomorrow at open sell your calls and buy shares. There is no next GME, until the short squeeze.

&#x200B;

Since I know some of you speak in emojis and tickers: $GME ✋💎🕒🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

TL;DR for those who can only read a little bit:

This is the last call for the GME rocket ship because

1. The short squeeze is still to come
2. On Friday 42% of GME float will be bought by MM
3. The squeeze will happen soon because shorts are bleeding money. fast.

Also:

4) Options are useless nowdays

5) $1000 is not a meme and GameStop could use a $1000 price in a huge turn around.

6) $NOK & $AMC are not the next GME until the short squeeze."|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212612.csv|StockTicker|['$GME', 'DR', 'AT']|['GME', 'AT']|['THIS', 'IS', 'THE', 'LAST', 'CALL', 'IT', 'IS', 'NOT', 'TOO', 'LATE', 'BUT', 'IT', 'WILL', 'BE', 'SOON', 'GME', 'HARES', 'BABY', 'I', 'GME', 'A', 'I', '$GME', 'GME', 'WAY', 'MOON', 'I', 'GME', 'HOLD', 'ANY', 'RC', 'SEC', 'GME', 'I', '$GME', 'DR', 'GME', 'GME', 'MM', '$NOK', '$AMC', 'GME']|['CALL', 'IT', 'TOO', 'IT', 'GME', 'BABY', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'ANY', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'MM', 'NOK', 'AMC', 'GME']

It’s a tale literally as old as time, but we can pull off something special here. If we wilt now, everything we have worked for and put up with to this point is for naught. 

Even worse than that, it means that we let their scare tactics win.

More importantly wallstreet is in a dark back room somewhere in NY trying to figure out a way to control the weaponized autism of this sub. Check post by verifying account history. How the account has previously been active on the sub before you buy new ideas.

They are coming to either create so much chaos nobody knows what fucking direction we are headed or control our buying power.

SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

WE LIKE THE STOCKKEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK

I just have a knack for explaining things and lots of people have asked about this topic so I thought I’d share my own personal thoughts.**

# The bull thesis

To date, the GME play has been pretty simple: buy and hold and wait for the squeeze, whether that comes in hours, days, or weeks. Try not to have a heart attack during the intermittent gamma squeezes, keep your hands diamond strong during the manipulated downward spikes, and buy baby buy.

It’s rapidly becoming apparent that we will soon enter the GME endgame. Before you can come up with an exit strategy or, if you’re still on the fence, decide whether to jump in, you need to form an opinion about the GME bull thesis, *without considering the short squeeze*. Your thoughts on the bull thesis will dictate how you play it from here on out.

One braindead simple way to calculate a fair stock price for a company is to use a ""times-revenue"" valuation. You take the company's revenue ($6.466B in 2020) and multiply by some magic number (often 0.5 for low-growth companies and 2 for high-growth companies), then divide by the float (number of shares available to trade, 50.65M). A times-revenue multiplier of 0.5 gives a GME stock price of $64, while a multiplier of 2 gives $255.

This isn't a particularly sophisticated method but whatever, I'm not a particularly sophisticated investor.

Working backwards, if Melvin Capital thinks that GME is overpriced at $20 then a times-revenue valuation would suggest a multiplier of 0.16. That's extraordinarily low for a retail business. If you applied that multiplier to Best Buy ($43B revenue in 2020, 231.59M float) you would get a stock price of $30. Best Buy currently trades for $115, which works out to a much more reasonable multiplier of 0.62.

What multiplier is correct? Well, the bulls point out:

* Ryan Cohen (13% stake in GME, sits on the board) has a great e-commerce success story with Chewy, his previous company.
* Three new successful e-commerce board members from Cohen's firm were added to the board in 2020.
* Despite being a brick-and-mortar business and the pandemic, Gamestop's balance sheet isn't bad. They have approx. $550M in debt, but more than that in cash (net cash positive). They have minimal risk of default or bankruptcy in the near future, even without any change to company direction.
* Their traditional core business of game and console sales is not shrinking as fast as many people expected, with major new consoles still supporting optical discs and digital game downloads not accelerating as fast as feared, possibly due to stagnation in the ISP industry. So even if Cohen and his board seats take a long time to roll out new changes, the company is in little danger of any sudden spiral.

So is Melvin right and GME is a dead-end company with no growth potential and should be valued with a times-revenue multiplier vastly below its competitors? Or is it more appropriate to think of it as a brand new business, being spring-boarded off the healthy books of an existing brand by a successful e-commerce businessman alongside a revamped board?

How you judge that determines your exit strategy.

# Exit strategy 1: Just along for the ride

Maybe you don't care at all about GME's balance sheet or Cohen's planned turnaround, you bought a couple shares on a whim to be part of a unique movement. You don't intend to be a long-term Gamestop shareholder nor do you really care if you miss out on the highest peaks, so long as you make a few dollars and get to say you were part of the squeeze.

If I were this person, what would I do? I'd pick a number between 0 and 3 that I feel represents my confidence in the retail market's current expectation for Cohen and GME, and multiply it by 128. I'd submit a limit sell order for all my shares at that share price.

# Exit strategy 2: Pants-shitting fear

You've got a handful of shares and maybe some options and you're up big. You don't know much about squeezes or fundamentals or greeks and every time there's a dip and the stock gets halted you shit your pants and your finger hovers over the sell button. But then the price jumps up and you wipe the drenching sweat off your face and promise to hold firm next time.

If I were this person, what would I do? I'd sell all my options that expire sooner than 30 days at market open to reduce the number of pairs of pants I'm going through. I'd keep all my shares and longer-dated options until the news comes out that the shorts are being liquidated. And I'm not watching hedge fund managers get on Fox Business or CNBC or whatever, I'm following WSB and Twitter for rapid fire updates about short volume. If the short volume as reported by WSB posters drops below, say, 50% I'm selling everything and getting out. I might also pick a maximum times-revenue multiplier (something pretty high, like 4 or 5) and use that for a limit sell for shares.

# Exit strategy 3: Diamond hands

You've got bigger balls than most, and this isn't your first time dumping a significant fraction of your net worth into a company whose financials you've never looked at. You want to ride it to the peak, if at all possible, and you want to impress the pants shitters and the weak-kneed with your maximum gains. You are ok with increasing your cost basis to squeeze out extra tendies on the way to the top.

If I were this person, what would I do? I'd sell my weeklies on open tomorrow and immediately plow every dollar of those 20-bagger returns into shares. If my longer-dated options were purchased at extreme IV I'd do the same for them, otherwise I'd let them ride. I wouldn't sell a single share until the final squeeze, when news comes out that Melvin is done, and then I'd unload (in my pants). See you on the moon, brother.

# Exit strategy 4: u/DeepFuckingValue

IF HE'S STILL IN I'M STILL IN

# FAQ 1: Is it too late to get in?

The best way to judge this is by looking at the exit strategies. Which person are you? If you're (1) then sure, buy a share or two to be part of a once-in-a-decade event, but think of it as a fun expense - a ticket to ride the squeeze train - not an investment. If you're (2) then hell yeah buy those shares baby but avoid options unless there's a dip. If you're (3) or (4) then you're already in and lying to your wife about how deep.

# FAQ 2: Was that the squeeze?! Is it over?

This must get posted every time there's a gamma squeeze. It's midmorning and price suddenly launches into the stratosphere, trading halts, and it crashes back down. No, that wasn't *the* squeeze. Gamma squeezes occur when options prices are rising (due to sudden increased options buying or volatility) faster than market makers can hedge. They're good to get your heart racing but a short squeeze is slower and more stable.

# FAQ 3: How high will it go during the squeeze?

Who knows. $500? $1000? $2000? There's really no way to know. If you have the stones to get those max tendies then you should focus on listening to the emerging news about Melvin Capital and Citadel rather than watching the price. Sell when they're covering and not a moment before. That will be the peak.

# FAQ 4: How long will this take?

Could be tomorrow morning, could be tomorrow afternoon, could be next week. At the rate that shorts are losing money it won't be much longer than that. If you're not in yet, this is the final boarding call.

# FAQ 5: Who will buy our shares at the peak?

The idea behind selling at the peak isn't to sell your shares to another retail trader, but to sell your shares to the desperate short sellers who are forced by their prime brokers to liquidate their positions at any cost. That's the difference between a perfectly legal and time-honored short squeeze and a pump-and-dump. This isn't about irrationally driving the price upwards with the hopes of selling to a bigger idiot, it's about buying and holding and waiting for the shorts to crack and beg us to sell to them.

# FAQ 6: What is the next stock?

Get this thought out of your head. Yeah you just joined WSB and made a few bucks and now you think you found yourself an investment club. **No**. This is a forum for folks to share their risky trade ideas, not a place to coordinate to manipulate the market. Yes, at the moment the consensus is that we can make a boatload of money off of dumbass hedge funds, but think of it less like a pack of draft horses following a path and more like a room of angry, shitting monkeys who happen, for the time being, to be throwing their shit in the same direction.

# FAQ 7: Am I gay?

Many of us grow up to assume that we’re straight only to find out, later, that we’re not. Sometimes, we realize this because we have sex dreams, sexual thoughts, or feelings of intense attraction toward people of the same gender as us. However, none of those things — sex dreams, sexual thoughts, or even feelings of intense attraction — necessarily “prove” your orientation. There are a few different forms of attraction. When it comes to orientation, we usually refer to romantic attraction (who you have strong romantic feelings for and desire a romantic relationship with) and sexual attraction (who you want to engage in sexual activity with). Sometimes we’re romantically and sexually attracted to the same groups of people. Sometimes we’re not. For example, it’s possible to be romantically attracted to men but sexually attracted to men, women, and nonbinary people. This sort of situation is called “mixed orientation” or “cross orientation” — and it’s totally OK. Bear this in mind as you consider your sexual and romantic feelings.


Edit:
- Thank you for all the awards and comments!
- I didn’t write the gay part at the end. Read more [here](https://www.healthline.com/health/am-i-gay) if you’re... ahem... curious.
- For the new folks who keep trying to fondle my balls, I’m not some genius or WSB autist-in-chief, I’m a bit player. I can’t get intercede with the mods or whatever you want me to do.
- Stop messaging me asking what you should do. Yes, Melvin Capital has been reported to have covered. You have to decide for yourself whether the squeeze is underway or complete and you should exit or whether you want to hold out for more, or take some profits and hold, or whatever. I just gave you a rough guide and some explanation of different thought processes, you have to make the call for yourself."|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212613.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'B', 'A', 'GME', 'GME', 'B', 'M', 'GME', 'M', 'ISP', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'CNBC', 'WSB', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'IV', 'I', 'IF', 'S', 'STILL', 'IN', 'M', 'STILL', 'IN', 'FAQ', 'FAQ', 'FAQ', 'FAQ', 'FAQ', 'FAQ', 'WSB', 'FAQ', 'I', 'OK', 'I', 'WSB', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'B', 'GME', 'GME', 'B', 'M', 'GME', 'M', 'ISP', 'GME', 'GME', 'S', 'M']

I don't need to give you an introduction into what's been going on here, so I'll get right into the pretty pictures.

**Strategy**

1. Get data on previous week’s WallStreetBets discussion from Quiver Quant API.
2. Identify the five most mentioned stocks.
3. Buy those stocks at the start of the trading week, sizing positions based on how much they were talked about in proportion to each other.
4. Sell positions at the end of the trading week.
5. Repeat

**Performance**

I initially considered examining the sentiment behind discussion of different tickers and constructing a market-neutral portfolio, but decided that taking short positions sounded like some bear shit and chose to steer clear.

Below is a visualization showing what the portfolio looked like every week. Note the bar sizes increasing and decreasing depending on how much capital we have to invest.

#THE PLAN


After we're done mailing boxes labeled ""extra Jimmy shares"" full of peanut brittle snakes to Melvin's Syndicate of Stupidity HQ, I propose we buy out the contract of the wax-headed Seinfeld character on CNBC. We simply shave off 2% of our collective gains, make our offer to CNBC, and collect our Cramery spoils. 


From then on, we make him the WSB mascot. Dress him as a clown and rent him out for children's burthday parties. Make him wear a sandwich board reading ""beanie babies are crash-proof"" and have him stand outside the NYSE every day until he straight up expires from old age. Legally change his name to Jimmy ToMoon? By all means.


Me? I just wanna dress him in little sweaters and take him on walks.

I am not receiving compensation for this post, and this post constitutes my opinion, not investment advice. 

&#x200B;

# Let's imagine you operate a hedge fund

Your hedge fund, let's call it Limonade Capital, or LC for short. You specialize in shorting stocks and have extremely large positions in BB, GME, AMC, NOK, and not much else. Your models all point to one expected 'truth': 

***The shorted stocks are expected to go bankrupt at some point in the future, and you maintain enough capital to hold your short positions until they do.*** 

Now, you've been operating fine on this assumption, but suddenly a bunch of other hedge funds take your same position in all these stocks. One of them, GME, now has more short than float. This is fine, you think, the stock will still go to 0 and everything will be as normal. 

But this time, you shorted a gamer stock. This was apparently a mistake, as the only thing gamers hate more than each other and GameStop are people who don't like gamers. Millions of morons suddenly purchase your stock, GME, and it's now horribly short. You panic and call a meeting. 

&#x200B;

You get all your traders in the meeting, and in between lines of blow and shots, you strategize this theory: 

* Outlast the gamers. These guys will get bored quickly and move onto the next thing/insult each other into ragequitting and be too busy fucking each other's moms to notice. 

You implement this strategy, and sit tight and do your usual media blitz saying the stock is worthless and the company is going to go down the drain yada yada yada. 

Unfortunately, this appears to have merely angered the gamers. They quickly convince all of their idiot friends to buy into GME with them, and suddenly your company is running short of capital. You do the only logical thing: 

* Raise capital to continue to try to outlast them. They'll get bored eventually. 

This appears to be a golden strategy, for about an hour. Your arch nemesis, Sexy Elongated Chad, SEC for short, remembered that time you told him you fucked his mother while playing against him in TESLA vs Gay Bears the game (Find it on steam). He took that personally. He proceeds to add to the stock's hype, and suddenly your gamers have found a whole new source of money as everything he says makes the news. 

You're sweating - you and your hedge fund pals all short now have to find a way to get this stock down to a point that you won't go bankrupt paying all these gamers to go away. You know this: 

* If you close your positions, your company will lose a significant chunk of its value, including the massive investment you just received. 
* Other hedge funds that followed you into this investment can't close their positions without creating a run on the stock - there's simply too many open positions and not enough stock. 
* Your only hope is the gamers getting bored and leaving before you run out of money and *have* to close your positions. 

After doing some more cocaine off your intern's ass, you come up with a new hypothetical brilliant plan. 

***Make the GME investors leave voluntarily before you are forced to close your positions triggering a short squeeze.*** 

You have these tools: 

1. Influence with the media
2. Short positions in AMC, NOK, BB. 
3. Some amount of money to try standard tactics of short laddering, etc. 
4. Make it harder to purchase new positions in GME when these investors realize their mistake. 

You start a media blitz, spreading FUD around GME and explaining how all the investors are going to be bag holders because the short squeeze is over (it hasn't started). 

You start blitzing the public forum with the GME investors, hyping AMC, NOK, and BB, causing a run on purchases there. 

You close all of your short positions in AMC, NOK, and BB, creating a short term short squeeze artificially combined with your media blitz both scaring potential investors away from GME and hyping AMC NOK and BB as you close your positions. 

This creates temporary gains on these stocks that eclipse those of GME - causing the hype herd to consider losing faith in GME and moving to the greener grass. Investors start to waiver and sell, thinking that the squeeze may be over. 

Meanwhile, your influence at the brokers is making it harder to purchase new positions in GME, which is slowly limiting GME's upside. 

You breath a sigh of relief - if enough of GME starts selling for AMC BB and others that you've hyped, there will be enough float to reduce the squeeze magnitude by purchasing shares from GME leaders, then selling them to other hedges in some weird game of pass the hot potato. 

Only problem with this plan: 

1. The play is extremely obvious. 
2. There is no plan B if it fails - you go bankrupt paying out your positions. 

&#x200B;

***If this theory is correct, selling GME is the only thing that can save shorts right now. They've offered a green pasture in other shorted stocks by liquidating their positions en masse, making them have artificial gains. They're trying to convince you to leave GME, go somewhere else, and not come back until they've had a chance to close or convince the SEC to fuck everyone over.*** 

The average short squeeze lasts 1.5 days [(Short Squeeze, 2012)](https://ramurapt.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/short-squeezes.pdf), followed by a minor correction. It's likely that Monday and Tuesday were an initial short squeeze on GME of the paper handed hedge funds, and a slight correction may occur tomorrow. This, combined with a misinformation blitz and the rapid short liquidation on AMC, etc is all an attempt to convince you to switch away from GME and give the more patient short hedge funds a chance to manipulate it to a level that they can accept, instead of a potentially much much larger short squeeze next monday. If Thursday is weak on GME, as the theory suggests, this will make the others look potentially stronger and temp people away.

The graph above is a link to GameStop’s Market Cap over time. If you notice, it’s sitting a little under $300M in the summer of 2019. 

This was the same time that our fearless leader initially bought calls. DFV beat Burry to the scene in July/August of 2019. At a current position of $48M, DFV has enough money to buy 17% of the company at it’s July 2019 market cap. That is absolutely fucking insane and a testament to this crazy ride.

This is merely my opinion on the GameStock bull case.

TLDR: Don't be fooled by the media claiming there is no fundamentals involved here. THESE ARE THE FUNDAMENTALS of short squeezes and stock trading. THE STOCK WILL RISE.

DD: The current GameStop infinity squeeze may seem to be ""irrational"", but that is why it is a successful ""to 4200.69"" infinity trade.  All infinity squeezes are the result of heavy over-shorting of shares which then become difficult or impossible to cover - this aggressive over-shorting only occurs when the bear thesis against the fundamentals is conclusively **strong** and very well **disseminated**. In other words, stocks which appear to be the “best short ideas” are also the ones which often end up being most likely to see the most violent short squeezes. The concept that GameStop is an outdated model with a strong ""near zero"" thesis is why our trade is so successful and will continue to be successful.

The more press and losses the hedge fund shorters receive and suffer, respectively, will force more covering of short positions at high prices. The high price is also encouraging more shorts to enter and short, being covered by the older, lower priced shorts but also reducing the shares available to cover the new short. Combined with the holding by longs, this will continue to create shorts. Those who have to cover options writing will have to cover or purchase shares to meet Friday options requirements (this is the GME ""hold til Friday, minimum"" argument).

The more GME rises and the more announcement that the stock is ""dissaociated from fundamentals"" will continue to drive panic of short sellers who will be stepping over each other for the exits. The longer they wait, the higher the squeeze will go.

**FUNDAMENTALLY:** GameStops underlying business model cannot affect its share price as a matter of stock fundamentals. THAT IS THE ENTIRE THEORY OF WSB. **When the number of shares shorted exceeds the tradeable float, the squeeze is a potent, unstoppable force. FUNDAMENTALS OF GAMESTOP'S BUSINESS HAVE NO BEARING ON A SQUEEZE. THE VALUE OF THE STOCK IS IN THE SCARCITY OF SHARES COMBINED WITH DEMAND FROM SHORT SELLERS TO COVER THEIR POSITIONS AND CLOSE OUT THEIR SHORTS.**

***FUNDAMENTALS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND ARE IN PLAY. THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL RULE IN ALL PRICING AND INVESTMENT MODELS.***"|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212613.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['THESE', 'ARE', 'THE', 'NTALS', 'THE', 'STOCK', 'WILL', 'RISE', 'GME', 'GME', 'THAT', 'IS', 'THE', 'NTIRE', 'HEORY', 'OF', 'WSB', 'NTALS', 'OF', 'S', 'INESS', 'HAVE', 'NO', 'ARING', 'ON', 'A', 'UEEZE', 'THE', 'VALUE', 'OF', 'THE', 'STOCK', 'IS', 'IN', 'THE', 'RCITY', 'OF', 'HARES', 'BINED', 'WITH', 'EMAND', 'FROM', 'SHORT', 'LLERS', 'TO', 'COVER', 'THEIR', 'TIONS', 'AND', 'CLOSE', 'OUT', 'THEIR', 'HORTS', 'NTALS', 'OF', 'UPPLY', 'AND', 'EMAND', 'ARE', 'IN', 'PLAY', 'THE', 'MOST', 'ENTAL', 'RULE', 'IN', 'ALL', 'ICING', 'AND', 'TMENT', 'ODELS']|['ARE', 'GME', 'GME', 'S', 'OUT', 'ARE', 'PLAY', 'ALL']

Don’t let the fear get to you, that’s just 🌈🐻 tactics. What the hedge fund did was illegal (Naked Shorts) and no one noticed. Some smart folks noticed way early and they’re sitting pretty right now, BUT STILL HOLDING. They’re (Hedge Fund Billionaires) the ones in trouble and the SEC will have to look into them more than us because we like the stock, and the company. 

If you start to get paper handed, think of all the times you had to fire up your shitty car, to drive to your shitty job barely making ends meet, to get yelled at by your shitty boss who makes way more than you. Think about how your parents had a house, kids, and nice things at your age while you’re still grinding for a better life and renting an apartment with roommates or working two jobs. They only needed one household income to stay afloat, most of us and our significant others have to work. 

We are only playing the game the boomers invented LONG before we even existed, and they’re just scared because we are playing by THEIR rules and winning. WE LIKE THE STOCK! GameStop is a childhood favorite of many, many Millennials and I still shop there for games before anyone else. We may even see a future with a brighter and better version of GameStop If we continue to HOLD. 

You’re not just holding for tendies, you’re holding onto nostalgia and childhood, and a chance at something better while also holding the billionaires and hedge funds accountable for their Market Manipulation, greed, and illegal activity. The more the government looks, the better for us.

BUY, AND HOLD. For our kin at 375, hang tight we’re en route just grabbing some fuel and rations. 

We MAY go down swinging, but at least we’ll show the billionaires that even gods can bleed and to mind their criminal activity in the future.

Melvin Capital reduced GME to $4 and held it under their thumb for a YEAR. I thought they had unwound on Monday and I was wrong.  They have 5 fucking years of puts and shorts of this stock.

**As Jim Cramer asked on CNBC just this week: Why didn't they just take their profit?  What was their goal? Bankrupt them?** Well Jim, I think they could have pushed that at any point between July 2019 and July 2020. So why hold it down for a year at their expense?  Do they fucking shop these companies out for takeovers?

There was a post earlier today about the largest individual shareholder - Donald Foss - [a self made billionaire who created his fortune financing used cars sales to underqualified buyers with pre-installed kill switches to ensure they paid their loans with brutal interest or faced next day repos and overpriced lawsuits](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/04/car-subprime-bubble-auto-loans-credit-acceptance-don-foss/) - now owns roughly 5% of Gamestop and that he looked like a ""jovial"" old man and must be pleased that his 5% purchase of Gamestop now worth $750million Dollars.  Some commented how it must have been a genius play or ""maybe he saw the DFV reddit posts"" or maybe he's just the luckiest boomer who decided to get into the Gaming Retail Space for Retirement Homes.  

This bugged the shit out of me to the point I should have been in bed 5 hours ago. Why the fuck would a ""billionaire"" 75yr old invest $14 Million in Gamestop on February 28, 2020 as a global pandemic was already unfolding and the impending economic impacts were already clear for anyone looking ahead?

Donald Foss is still an insider, theres a pepe silvia trail.  In 2015, the CACC stock was heading down, quite frankly resembling a sustained short attack. It had just run into some legal trouble, so maybe it was a good target to short? Maybe one of the Scumbag-Asshole-Cohert Trading Firms was doing just that?

[On October 23, 2014, roughly a month after Melvin Capital is started by Gabe Plotkin, Donald Foss sells 430,967 shares of CACC trading at $125.54 for $54million.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000120919114064903/xslF345X03/doc4.xml) 
Gamestop was trading at $34.  

[On December 31 2014 Donald Foss reports using 320,000 shares valued at $44.8 Million as collateral for a loan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000088555015000021/fosssc13g20141231.htm)

In the 3rd quarter of 2015, Melvin Capital buys puts on GME. I don't have the value of puts in 2015, but in 2018 those puts were amounted to $17,395,000.   
[On December 31 2015 Donald Foss reports using 570,000 shares valued at $114Million as collateral for a loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000088555016000086/fosssc13g20151231.htm)

**In the 3rd Quarter of 2015, Gamestock shares crash 67% from $41 to $28** Most likely because of poor fundamentals.

In 2016 Donald Foss does not touch his shares of CACC. 2015/2016 was a year of hot water for CACC. Game Stop barely moves trading the whole year from $28 - $25  

[On December 31 2017 Donald Foss reports using 220,000 shares valued at $71.5 Million as collateral for a loan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000114420418008911/tv486077_sc13ga.htm)
Gamestop is now trading at $18

[On December 31 2018 Donald Foss reports using 220,000 shares valued at $82.5 Million as collateral for a loan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000114420419007123/tv513133_sc13ga.htm) 
Gamestop is now trading at $12

In 2019 Donald Foss does not touch his shares of CACC.

**In June 2019, u/DEEPFUCKINGVALUE opens $55,000 worth of 18 month Call options on GME**
**In August 2019, Dr Michael Burry reports a significant purchase of GME**

[On February 28, 2020, Donald Foss purchases 3,515,200 shares, a 5.3% ownership stake, of Gamestop for $14 Million](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/901185/000110465920030651/tv538831_sc13g.htm) **Pure speculation, but Donald Foss most likely purchases this stake as he is a BIG FAN OF THE STOCK, out of every other stock on the market, this is the only one he has significantly invested into in the past 5 years.**
[In 2020 Melvin Capital has puts amounted to $55,080,000.](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link). 
Gamestop is trading at $4.

[From March 2020 until July 2020 - Donald Foss begins liquidating 250,000 shares of his CACC to the tune of $95,207,250, in the most unprecedented manner from his holdings, all while CACC stock price is fluctuating all over the place due to Rona + Fed Kangaroo Markets. These payments were coming out every couple days in quantities of 6000 - 10000 shares.](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0000901185&type=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0&count=40) 

**Where is this fucking money going??? It would have been enough to buy another 24million shares *to try to* increase his total holding to 38 Million shares, or over 51% of the 69.75Million float**  

In August 2020, Gamestop hits $5. Data available to me and my will to keep typing is gone.  *Did Foss continue to liquidate CACC into August/Sept?*

Everyone on the fucking planet knows where Gamestop is now.

TODAY CACC MOVED *closely* IN LINE WITH GME ATTACKS.  CACC STOCK HAS NEVER BEEN DECLARED IN A  13F BY MELVIN CAPITAL.  CACC STOCK IS BEING USED AS A LOAN OR SOMETHING BY FOSS THOUGH.  MELVIN USED ALL HIS OTHER DECLARED STOCKS IN THE ATTACKS WITH HEAVY SELL VOLUMES PRECEDING PRICE BOMBS.

Why does this look like a hostile takeover play that took 5 fucking years and they fucked up?? Why wouldnt the guy that invested $14M thats now worth $750M talk to the media AT ALL? What the fuck does he want Gamestop for at 75 yrs old?! And it took 5 fucking years to execute?!

TL;DR Did Deepfuckingvalue prevent a 5year vulture capitalism play? WTF?  SEC Give me Award.

Because this is what it was : A coordinate cyberattack on Reddit. I think the mods could have a word to say about what happened today. I like to think that if they could file a complaint for cyberattack, this would have a huge impact and help the SEC find who was really manipulating the market here...


Because there was definitely a market manipulation. But not orchestred by Redditors. Look what happened to Nokia stocks : the price doubled in 10 min for no reasons ! And you all know the volume required to move such a beast in only 10 min (6 billions shares outstanding !)! Such a volume in such a short period of time can only be triggered by an institutional actor... And let's not forget AMC, BBY, NAKD etc... just in order to throw smoke at your face... That’s ridiculous... Congrats to those who could make good gains today. 

I am disgusted by the fact that because those short sellers could not face their failure, they decided to attack a public forum, force brokers to stop all trading on GME, and lie on public TV.
 
Let’s be clear here: we do not manipulate the market. We are a public forum where we exchange ideas on stocks and options. Nobody is forced to buy or sell something. Everybody can join and leave whenever he desires to. We are not coordinated nor organized. Each individual is completely independent.

I just wanted to take this out of my chest. 
 
Personally, I will keep GME…. Just because I am little bit retarded and because I like the stock.

**Retail does not want to be manipulated anymore.**

For decades Wall Street was manipulating securities, getting away with it, and blaming it on others. Through the media, bullshit target prices, naked short selling, or other forms of manipulation mentioned [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_manipulation) (Kenneth, [this one](https://www.ft.com/content/16cee174-3b7f-11ea-b232-000f4477fbca)'s for you). Citadel and many other MMs - don't misinterpret with Market Makers, we're talking about Market Manipulators here - got away with their dirty tactics to make shitload of money and screw people over. They finally got caught in their own game and tried everything to turn it around, but Shitron didn't work, the media didn't work, more aggressive selling didn't work. Now they're calling through some random crooks for regulations.

**BULLSHIT.** Regulation for what? Exchange of ideas? Our own Due Diligence? Winning against you in your own game? Yeah, in most cases your buddies at the SEC would gladly do so if you tell them anyway. This time though? People finally came to the realisation what the fuck you guys are doing over there. It was known by many since 2008 but people forgot quickly, and now is the time to remind them that you are no one else's friend but your crooked buddies.

I never thought I'd say this, but this community showed more leadership and guidance than any other media network. Providing knowledge, research, answers, many of you proven that **you are better people** than these fuckers with billions of dollars of AUM. You should be proud of yourselves as you are leading an unprecedented event in the history of finance. **Unprecedented.** This is why you should still guide others and be an example. Of course, we are not an entity and we will never be - just remember that you are a part of something great, maybe something that will change the way financial world operates, in a smaller or larger way. Remember that there are sharks among us who got pissed at the dirty games as well (shoutout to you Elon & Chamath). We are not alone.

They blame us? Let's blame them. They will lose all credibility sooner than later, not to mention this incoming generation. The media is here now, you still might convince my 80-year old grandpa that the internet is something out of Pandora's Box, but soon enough you won't be able to convince a single person. We are an important source of information for many people, and I'm not talking about WSB, but about the people that make it. Let's go there in the world and spread the facts.

Most people short GME are from professional institutions. Melvin Capital most obviously.

What they can do is buy themselves time. That's what happened Monday with the 2B received from Point72 and Citadel. This cash influx acts as collateral for the brokers that have lent them the shares to short. It also is used to cover their borrowing fees. These fees are calculated daily based on a percentage of their total borrowed shares and the underlying principle. That 2B only lasted them about four hours due to the price spiking.

At $175.00, Melvin is essentially insolvent. The only reason covering and the squeeze hasn't occurred yet is because through various theories or unpublicized new cash access they've convinced lenders the price cannot or will not remain at these levels. We simply need to hold our positions until Melvin cannot afford their borrow prices, or the brokers and MMs call it start covering for them. I'm guessing Friday afternoon is that time.

This isn't to say price isn't important, it is. However HOLDING THE FUCKING LINE is crucial.

This also doesn't even account for the stupid illiquidity and tiny float:borrow ratio on the stock.

TLDR; Don't fucking sell."|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212615.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['GME', 'B', 'B', 'LDING', 'THE', 'CKING', 'LINE']|['GME', 'B', 'B', 'LINE']

We all remember when he complained that shorting should be illegal, and when he released “short shorts” when he finally defeated them. 

But guess who used to brag about shorting Tesla? Gabe 🌈🐻 Plotkin. 

From [Bloomberg:](https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2019-07-19/cohen-cub-gabriel-plotkin-sees-fund-surge-about-44-this-year)

Plotkin described Melvin as “a very human-intensive place. We have a lot of analysts, we require a lot out of them.” The team has modeled more than 500 companies in “significant detail,” while a data science group reads into trends.
He added that the firm has an “intense focus” on the short side, with about 70% of profits in Melvin’s first year coming from bearish bets. Plotkin expressed skepticism about mall real estate investment trusts, as well as electric-car maker Tesla Inc.

$GME to the 🌚, then profits back to a safe store of value: $TSLA.

UPDATE: [better source](https://fintel.io/so/us/tsla/melvin-capital-management-lp) showing Melvin Capital’s puts on TSLA from 2016 through 2020

The answer to this is [naked short selling](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp) which has been illegal since 2008. The hedge funds such as Melvin Capital among others have been engaging in illegal activities and should be the ones who are prosecuted by the SEC.

Spread the word and control the narrative. We are not the root problem to this clusterfuck and it is time for the boomers at Wall Street to pay the fuck up for their illegal activities because we retards like the stock.

It’s why retarded boomers have been lured into paying them 1.5% management fees and 15% of profits (or higher). 

And when you pay those fees, you’re entitled to a little information about what is in the portfolio. Boomer hedge fund managers love to brag about their short positions, they love acting all intellectual even though most of them suck at short picking. 

But now, no hedge fund manager is going to tell any investor anything. They will never trust their own investors enough to disclose a single short position. You retards have single handedly broken the trust that every boomer hedgie relies on to collect their overpriced fees for their shit hedge fund.

This is crayon markings on drool-soaked construction paper. This is not investment advice. I am not a financial advisor. This is pure fiction.*

**LADDER ATTACK** - from this morning

- Begin 9:30 AM at $351.94
- End 10:15 AM at $249.72

**SHORT POSITIONS CLOSING**

- Short interest as % of float, 10:15 AM: 140.53%
- Short interest as % of float, 11:00 AM: 140.31%

**RESULT**

- Closing 0.22% of short interest compared to float, share price at 11:00 AM - $372.74

**ARBITRARY HYPOTHESIS**

- Short squeeze lasts until, say, ""only"" 70% of float is shorted. Let's assume the big boys have to get out of only half their positions by late [February](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ws97/friday_12921_gme_expiry_date_means_nothing_dont/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), and are finding capital and big grace to worry about the other 70% after Match.
- If 0.22% closure of shorts required +$123 in share price, then an autistic naive ratio means that closing 70% (318 units of 0.22% increments) of open short positions may increase the share price by ($123 x 317 =)  **$39,136.36** above the baseline, wherever that may be.

TLDR for lazy stupid assholes is near the bottom


NEWBS! Please take a brief break from the GME orgy that this sub has become to read this:

Recently I’ve seen a LOT of folks in the comments talking about which stock should be pumped next. Obviously there are a lot of you new people visiting WSB and it’s physically painful how ignorant some of you are regarding the very basics of WSB, the GME play, trade laws, and investing in general. If you’re thinking “that’s not me I’m one of the good ones I don’t need this” you’re wrong. Keep reading.

Contrary to what recent events may lead many to believe this sub is not for pumping and/or dumping unless we’re talking about our respective wives and their boyfriends. Go back even just a month and you’ll see, among other things, detailed discussions about the pros and cons of various stocks. You’ll even find some of the catalyst GME DDs that fully explain the logic behind the investment on a fundamental level (I encourage you to read those so you understand the mechanisms behind why we’re at where we’re at). What you WON’T find is the hyper focused mob mentality currently propelling GME into the stratosphere. This is important to note because...

A lot of you are already, or will soon be, looking for your next fix. It doesn’t exist. THERE IS NO NEXT GME. This is likely a once in a lifetime event. That’s not to say that there aren’t solid gains to be found here, but they aren’t found by banding together to pump a stock for no reason beyond it being the next mob mentality pick. In fact trying to pump a stock as a group is a terrible idea for two main reasons: 

1. It’s way more legally dubious than what’s happening with GME and if we’re too flagrant about it it could potentially get people in trouble and/or trigger restrictive legislative action. We’ve seen many many times before that the financial bodies of this country LOVE to go after the little guys, so don’t give them justification. 

2. GME is a special case where a very autistic person tipped off retail investors to a very retarded move by a hedge fund. Normally retail investors don’t have an advantage over the big boys. If you try to attack them or play them or game the system you’re more than likely going to get stomped into the dirt. 

As you start to consider your investing future beyond GME please first take the time to look back at some posts from months/years past to get a better idea of what WSB is when we aren’t crushing shitrons balls. If this sub turns into a pump and dump forum it’ll be shut down, which would be sad :’(

As a still inexperienced retard myself I PROMISE you the best way you can help this sub and yourself is to sit down, shut up, read DDs from people much more autistic than yourself, and gain knowledge so that one day you can be the autist rather than the retard.

Welcome to WSB


TLDR; You are not going to be consistently successful with foundationally bankrupt pump and dump plays. You also jeopardize this sub and retail investing as a whole by attempting to do so. If you can’t accept those facts then leave this subreddit because we don’t want you. Sit down. Shut up. And maybe learn a thing or two. 

ADDED BONUS: if you stop spamming useless posts and comments it will be easier for the mod team to sort through the bot attack


Mods I know you’ve more than got your hands full rn, but I think it could be smart to at least temporarily ban anyone who talks about pumping a stock in order to protect this sub from entities that would use that as evidence to shut WSB down.

The shorts are dumping the price down in After Hours on low volume to make you think that its all gone to shit at market open so that you sell. 

Nothing has changed for GME shareholders since close. The number of shares GME shareholders own is more important than the Price of those shares. There is nothing the shorts can do to force GME shareholders to sell besides giving them the price they want to sell at.

They're making you think that price is the after hours price but that price is temporary.

If you believe in GME, if you dont think the share price is where it should be then do not be fooled by the shorts and sell at market open. That would be panicking.

Follow my profile if you're interested as I'll be doing this daily leading up to the earnings report of 04 February 2021.

I just spent another couple hours making this DD for you guys!

Please [check out my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5q4nd/option_analysis_and_how_it_will_effect_nok_price/) from yesterday where I predicted stock volatility today based on option data if you're interested in seeing where we came from to where we are now.

&#x200B;

This post aims to do 4 things -

1. We'll determine if I was correct yesterday based on todays events
2. We'll look at what we may see tomorrow based on todays data
3. We'll examine what all of this means for Nokia as a whole going forward
4. TL;DR and Conclusion

# Part 1 - Analyzing the Analysis

In my last post, I projected that on 26 January 2021, almost all of the crazy volatility was done at the $5 price range for $NOK. That determination was made based on Open Interest in both $5 Calls and Puts, and the amount of coverage major institutions had likely achieved during yesterday's trading hours.

This morning, shortly after market open, the stock price broke $5 and immediately experienced a fluctuation of \~$0.30 up and down over about 10 minutes.

[Between 09:58 and 10:12](https://preview.redd.it/hpaqyk8aoxd61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9ef51c0cd22e787b514845a83888f808eb35ee6)

Was I correct in my assessment? Yes and no.

Why yes -

Based on yesterdays numbers, I was correct. The institutions who had written the $5 call and put options had successfully covered themselves.

Why no -

There was a high volume of $5 calls and puts that were purchased this morning which likely lead to those same institutions having to buy more coverage. The rapid purchasing of shares by institutions as the price broke $5 is likely what caused this small jump. This is always something to watch for as the market is opening, especially when the stock is so high volume like $NOK.

In my post yesterday, I made a point that there will be more volatility as we approach the next significant strike price of $7. That is exactly what we witnessed today.

[10:37](https://preview.redd.it/x3f0q5ogpxd61.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa6a82867fba19dd661630cccd19b02bbdf17900)

At 10:37, prices got close enough/surpassed $7 and a wild combination of institutional buying and bullish market sentiment lead to \~100,000,000 shares being traded over the course of about \~30 minutes. Prices jumped to nearly $10 and rapidly dropped back to around $7 as institutions scrambled to cover $7 calls and puts. I'm sure there was also quite a bit of panic buys/sells as well as short sellers getting involved.

Was I correct in my assertion yesterday? Yes.

I had pointed out yesterday that this was likely to happen given the growing number of call/put options at $7 and institutions' need to cover. I would add that I did not expect the volume to reach such insane numbers during this period, however.

After these two major movements in $NOK, we experienced several more halts as well as a press release from Nokia. The [press release](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/27/nokia-comments-on-trading-activity-of-its-stock/) was essentially an official statement to let various regulatory agencies know that Nokia management had nothing to do with stock price rise. Following the statement, prices rose to $7.77 before gradually coming back to \~$6.60 at close of market.

I did obviously could not project a halt by the exchange followed by a press release from Nokia, but I hope everyone here was able to stay calm through the waves.

If I missed anything or anyone has a different perspective, please comment! I love criticism and I'm pretty retarded.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Part 2 - Today's Data and what it could mean for tomorrow

For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to provide aggregate numbers (volume and open interest) for options that are of significance from all dates. I put together all of this data immediately follow market close on 27 January 2021.

Here we go:

|Type|Strike Price|Volume|Open Interest|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Call|$7|511,986|502,584|
|Call|$8|213,985|43,063|
|Call|$9|230,863|62,627|
|Call|$10|842,327|325,966|
|Put|$7|25,131|62,650|
|Put|$8|2,078|1,689|
|Put|$9|1,215|1,144|
|Put|$10|5,500|1,787|

What can we take from looking at these numbers?

1. The ratio of calls to puts is fucking insane. Market sentiment for $NOK is incredibly high based purely on the high volume of movement in calls and the insanely high open interest in OTM call options. In other words, a massive number of investors believe this stock will continue climbing. This can end up being a self-fulfilling prophecy as sentiment grows more bullish and prices continue rising.
2. Because it looks like market sentiment is growing to be even more bullish, I expect the volume of OTM calls to stay high. However, the Open Interest (number of contracts in circulation) has actually stayed roughly the same. That means that the institutions who sell the contracts aren't writing more because they think those contracts will be ITM in the near future (bullish). It also means that we might see *less* sudden volatility as we go past the $7 and $10 mark.
3. The number of ITM puts has gone up at $7, meaning we may see sudden and temporary downward shifts the next time we pass $7. **If/when this happens, don't stress. The institutions who wrote the new put options will need to short-sell in order to cover.** There are around 3,000,000 shares that would need to be sold off in order to cover. This brief selloff could trigger some temporary price panic.
4. Trade volume reached a whopping total of 1,078,887,291 by end of market. It was around 300,000,000 yesterday. People are not only watching but throwing their money into the pool as well.

TL;DR -

Things look really good going forward, with some upcoming turbulence around $7 from institutional short selling and panic sellers who don't have 💎🙌.

# Part 3 - What does it all mean?!?!

Well, first off I'd like to point out that people with money are starting to get upset. As I'm sure everyone else has been seeing, media coverage of us has been absolutely insane. News agencies are trying to brush off stocks like $NOK by saying they have no value, without actually discussing the excellent financials and major developmental announcements made by Nokia for the future.

* $NOK generated a net income of [\~$730,000,000](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NOK/financials?p=NOK) in the last 12 months.
* $NOK has an excellent [balance sheet](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NOK/balance-sheet?p=NOK).
* $NOK has a [free cash flow](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NOK/cash-flow?p=NOK) of $1,936,000,000. That's a shitload of money that will likely be put towards future endeavors and development.
* $NOK has been consistently on the frontpage of most major news networks in a positive light. Publicity like this will generate more investment which creates more financial potential for growth.

With that being said, the only short interest data I have is from 31 December 2020, which showed only \~50,000,000 shares short. I would guess that the number has grown dramatically due to various speculation about WSB and $NOK value. It will also grow as institutions cover their puts options.

As price rises, I expect we will see similar sentiment from the news that we've seen with $GME and $BB. Will there be a squeeze like $GME? Probably not, but that doesn't mean there cant be a margin call as the prices rise, which will eventually force prices upwards significantly.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# TL;DR and Conclusion

Put simply, $NOK is extremely bullish with data and gains to show for it. And as much as the news wants to believe, $NOK's financials and prospective future is actually pretty fuckin' solid.

Why is this all happening now? Our community has consistently identified excellent value investment, and now people are looking at $NOK because we did. Trade volume didn't jump 300% for no reason.

Disclaimer and my Holdings -

I currently own 10 of [these bad boys](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NOK210716C00005000?p=NOK210716C00005000). Those are $5 Call options that expire 16 July 2021. I'll be holding these for a while 🚀.

I worked pretty hard on this throughout the day so I really hope this helps some people. If you see anything wrong or something that should be changed, please let me know!

Does anybody know when the expiration dates are for most of the hedge shorts? I know a lot were for the end of the month but when the hedge funds doubled down and then continued to double down did they actually use their brain and set a later expiration date? If so we should hold our shares until they expire or they close the position.

When someone thinks a stock is going to go down or a company will go bankrupt, they can borrow shares from their broker to open a ""short"" position.  They then sell the shares immediately at the current market price.  They have a specified amount of time to return the borrowed shares to the brokerage.

If the stock does go down, the investor buys that number of shares at the now lower current market price, and then returns them to the broker.  He/she keeps the difference.

If the stock goes up, they have to ""cover"" their position.  They can ""buy-to-close"" whenever they want, but many of them will wait for a very long time because they are large firms who have a lot of money and leeway with their brokerage.  However, if a stock keeps going up and up, the brokerages can call the investor and demand the shares back to hedge *their* losses.  This forced buying drives the price up even more, which then causes other brokerages to make the same phone call to their clients, and so on and so forth.  This is called a ""short squeeze"".

\---

GameStop is a declining brick-and-mortar video game retailer.  Their management has not adapted to the digital world where many video games are downloaded instead of on discs.  They have been making some moves in the right direction, such as closing underperforming stores and paying down some debt, but they need to reinvent themselves to succeed.  Many large investors/firms have seen this coming and took out short positions a few years ago.  The stock kept going down so the brokerages and banks hadn't called yet. GME is the most-heavily shorted stock on the market.  More shares are shorted than are in circulation.  It's called ""naked short selling"", it's complicated, and some of it is probably illegal but the SEC looks away.

[Ryan Cohen](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890) founded Chewy.com when he was 25 and sold it six or so years later for $3.5 billion.  Last August, he purchased 9% of GME's shares.  When it was disclosed in the SEC filings, the stock went up 22% in a day (which is a LOT in normal circumstances).  The thought being that he was going to attempt to take over the company.  There was a lot of speculation online.  In late November he wrote a [strongly-worded letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf) to the Board of Directors.

Shortly before Christmas, he disclosed that he had bought more shares and now owns 12.9% of the company.  He bought the new shares at $16ish, after buying the first batch around $4.  When someone owns 10% or more of a company, there are heavy limitations on how much they can sell at one time, in a given period, and they have to disclose everything.

This signaled that he wasn't in it for a quick buck and he probably really was going to try to take over and modernize the entire company.  Gamestop has something like 55 million members in their club/newsletter thing, and that data can be used to make a lot of money through targeted advertising and such.   There have also been confirmed rumors that the company will be making a serious run at the fast-growing PC gaming market (many serious gamers build their own computers).  Video game competitions are also very popular and can be capitalized on.  The stock continued to slowly climb, with some sell-offs and such along the way.  It was not for the faint of heart.

Fast-forward to January 10th, when it was announced that Cohen and two of his board members from Chewy were officially appointed to the GameStop Board.  It was really looking like the theories from last fall were correct.  The news sent the stock soaring and the investors who had short positions were in big trouble.  Some of them started covering their debt, but many didn't and still haven't. The ones that did have incurred losses in the collective billions, and there are many more billions still out there that will be lost by short investors.

For the past two weeks, the pro-GameStop investors have shown great interest in the potential turnaround story of a store that plays a big role in their childhood memories.  With the presence of Cohen and his buddies from Chewy, an e-commerce giant, small investors can see that GameStop is now undervalued to those who believe in the new Board members.

The stock has been incredibly volatile as the large investment firms try to drive the price down.  One way they can do this by opening massive new short positions (AKA selling large chunks of shares all at once) as other shorts return their borrowed shares to the pool.  This can be seen many times along the daily charts of GME, in nearly vertical declines.  Knowing the potential of both Cohen and the short squeeze, small investors have been buying up all the dips.  If the shares are being held, and not sold, they are unavailable to be returned to brokerages. This drives the price up even MORE as the short investors scramble to buy whatever shares are available to fill their debt before the price continues to rise. Eventually someone is left holding the shares purchased at the highest possible price, but in this once-in-a-lifetime case, it probably won't be someone with a net worth under $100 million.

409|l6fw05|Important Information Regarding Short Squeeze on GME (From experience and research)|t3_l6fw05|0.98|155|155|hot|2021-01-28 01:13:41.000000|DHK007|16|Discussion|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6fw05/important_information_regarding_short_squeeze_on/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6fw05/important_information_regarding_short_squeeze_on/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6fw05/important_information_regarding_short_squeeze_on/|"First off, I like this stock and make your own financial decisions. I'm here just to share my experience.I've read articles on short squeeze on Volkwagen and part of the free money TSLA Inclusion of S&P 500.

**1. If you want to be fully part of the squeeze, you should HOLD until the following week. People will be tempted to sell as soon as it's friday because that's the day but that's only the very beginning of the ""End game""**

Why?

Volkwagen Short Squeeze was triggered and lasted two days. The Short Squeeze is very obvious and can be evaluated based off the VWAP and consistent constant large chunks of volume. We have neither seen any of these signs. Assuming all the options are exercised and shorts are planning to execute on Friday, this violent and volatile price action will go on until the next week.

\*\*2. Those institutions and hedge funds shorting? They WILL exercise on Friday but dont count on them doing so until the end of POwer hour (3pm-4pm)?\*\*

Dont believe me? 

Check how Index Funds and MM played the Tesla Inclusion. No suspensions or halts but gigantic sell walls, and FOMO'd a huge bulk of scalpers in the power hour and made them think ""hey...maybe index funds already bought TSLA? Maybe...we should sell..omg we're  screwed""TSLA dropped from 685 to 635 in 10 minutes.What happened next? index funds swooped in and bought all the paper hands selling in unprecedented bulk buys, driving the  price all the way to 665-695.

Expect similar things about GME on Friday. Shorts will cover.They will wait until the last  opportunity to do so using psychological fear tactics. Expect a gigantic s pike at the wee hours of  Friday.

3.  \*\*Hold. Hold. Hold.\*\*

Looking at the charts, it's obvious, the MM are adapting to the situation

.On Monday, they suspended and halted. This did nothing. So they adapted.  
On Tuesday, they suspended/halted AND the shorts doubled down (Melvin's borrow from POint72) to instill fear and get people to sell to drive vicious sell action. People held and bought more, and they realized its futile and prices return to normals yet again.  
On Wednesday, we saw a new strategy. They halted (which did nothing), but we  saw a steady stream of attacks from shorting the stock instead of a gigantic price action. This actually had a bit of an effect to a degree as we did not witness any massive spikes throughout the day.Another strategy we are witnessing is the after hour action.  


On tuesday, we were blessed with Elon Musk liking the stock and the tesla cult joining in also liking the stock. However, without a catalyst, we are witnessing a stead stream of attacks to drive down prices in the after hours (something we havent seen before), as the same attack was consistent across all tickers: GME, AMC, NOK, BB (all the WSB stocks)This is not coincidence.

Solution ?Buy more, hold. Like all the stocks.

\*\*TL;DR. Hold until Monday. Keep buying. Short Squeeze inc.\*\*

This is my personal  opinion, don't treat it as fact, and I'm not a financial advisor so always doing your own research before arriving to any type of conclusion. 

Also years of experience in the stock market made me realize how scummy people like Shitron, and MMs are at manipulating prices to your advantage. You can go fuck yourselves.

Remember DON'T SELL, if you wanna buy BUY. I added 2k today. Am I worried? no, and you should not too. We are just at the beginning. Jump in onboard retard.

I’ll also introduce those of you that are unfamiliar how r/wallstreetbet’s favorite gambling device, stock options, actually work and how they can be used by this subreddit as a weapon of mass destruction against hedge funds like Melvin - all dumbed down to a fifth grade reading level so that the average person in this subreddit will mostly understand what I’m talking about.

Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

### Shorting

**How It Works**

Most traditional (i.e. boomer) investors usually try to make money by going long - i.e. “buy low and sell high”; this is when you buy a stock thinking it will go up in the future (bullish). Shorting is the opposite of this, you “sell high and buy low”, thinking the stock will go down in the future (bearish). This is usually done through the broker, where the prospective short seller would “borrow” the shares from them, and they would need to pay back these shares in some future date by “covering their shorts” - or buying back the exact same quantity of shares they owe the broker.

For example, imagine that there were only 10 Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards in the world. Because nobody wants to deal with taking physical possession of these cards and risk losing their Pokemon card in their laundry or something, everyone pays a Pokemon card dealer a small fee to store it for them. Through their dealer, you can buy and sell these Pokemon cards as well. A 🌈🐻 realizes that maybe Pokemon cards are dumb and borrows 2 Surprised Pikachu cards (who has a prearranged agreement with some institutional Pokemon card hoarder to loan them out for interest) and sell them for $420 each, thinking that they're actually work $100 at most, and plans to buy the Pokemon cards back at that price to repay his Pokemon card loan (i.e. covering their shorts) - this is a short sale. Since no one actually wants to physically hold these Pokemon cards, these cards physically stay with the dealer who could then lend out these exact same Pokemon card if the buyer also has an agreement to allow them to do so. This means that you can actually have people owing more than the total number of Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards in existence (i.e. short interest > 100%).

Replace “Surprised Pikachu Pokemon card” with stocks and “Pokemon card dealer” with “broker” and you have a short sale of shares. Interestingly enough, this also applies 80% to how banks work as well.

**Short Squeezes**

So when does a short seller need to cover their shorts? Well, either when a) The short seller wants to, either to take profit or to stop a loss, b) Their broker forces them to through a margin call, or c) The broker forces them to as the broker has recalled their loan, usually for a hard to borrow stock - they get “bought in”. Today, we’ll focus on C) because this is how short squeezes happen.

So, what does a broker recalling their loan mean? Well, to go back to the Pokemon card example, imagine that the dealer only has 6 Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards that he’s legally allowed to loan out. Some more 🌈🐻 short sells all the 6 remaining Pokemon cards until the dealer has no more available on hand. So what happens when someone wants to buy a Surprised Pikachu Pokemon Card and doesn’t want the dealer to lend out their cards? He’ll have to force one of those 🌈🐻 to buy back the card that they owe them so the dealer can give it to the prospective buyer. But who can the 🌈🐻 buy back the card from? The dealer. But the dealer doesn’t have any cards to sell, so they need to force another 🌈🐻 to cover so that the former 🌈🐻 can cover their shorts. This vicious cycle repeats and leads towards a sudden surge in demand for Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards and a spike in prices for it - a short squeeze.

**The Institutional Factor**

One thing alluded above was that shares can only be borrowed from \*some\* share holders, but not all. So who exactly can and does a broker typically borrow these shares from? These are usually margin accounts of either institutional and sometimes (although much less frequently) retail investors. Usually, when an entity signs a margin agreement, which allows them to borrow either cash or shares from the broker, they give permission to the broker to also lend out their shares in the process, and thereby also give up their voting rights - in case you’ve ever wondered who actually the share \*actually\* belonged to in shareholders meetings. Since almost every institution except Warren Buffet uses margin to a certain extent, and not that many retail investors do, especially given that retirement accounts are forbidden to use margin, and it’s much easier to “find” one big source of TSLA shares from one big institution with a margin account rather than find thousands of smaller margin retail accounts who hold TSLA shares, so most of the time, these shares are being borrowed from an institution (i.e. pension fund, hedge fund). This means that shares that are almost disproportionately held by retail investors are much harder to short because they’re harder to borrow from the broker, and retail-heavy stocks like HTZ, GME, NIO, and NKLA, which virtually no institutions actually hold, will demand high interest rates when shorting and the sellers can much more easily be forced to cover during a short squeeze.

### Stock Options

**What are Stock Options**

A stock option is a contract between the writer and whoever holds it that gives the option holder the right to buy (call option) or sell (put option) 100 shares of the underlying stock on or before the expiry date at a specified strike price. So for example, buying a GME 1/29 $1000c gives whoever the holder of this contract is the option to buy from the writer of this contract 100 shares of GME at $1000 / share on or before 1/29. Obviously if GME is lower than $1000 before that date, the holder would be an idiot to exercise this option to buy GME shares for more than their current market value, so they expire worthless.

This effectively provides the option holder an immense amount of leverage, and provides the opportunity for them to 10x or even 100x their original investment if the underlying asset moves the right way - for example because a subreddit declares war on a hedge fund and pumps up a stock to make them go bankrupt, while limiting their losses to the cost of the option. The option writer will in return receive a premium for the option, potentially risking an infinite amount of money, but with a high likelihood of making a small profit. These writers would either be

1. Theta gang - who are looking to generate a tidy income source from those option premiums and pray that the stock doesn’t move in the wrong direction too much
2. A market maker - who writes the contract when they see an arbitrage opportunity between the market value of an option and the theoretical value of it, and hedging their contract they wrote by buying / shorting the underlying assets so they effectively don’t actually take a position in the market.

We’ll go over how 2) works and how this mechanism can be used as a financial nuclear bomb, but first you need to learn some greek. 

**The Greeks**

The greeks in finance is a set of factors that can affect the price of a stock option / group of options

Delta - Change of the option price as the stock price changes

Gamma - Change in Delta as the stock price changes

Vega - Change in the option price as volatility of the stock changes

Theta - The decay in the option price as the expiration date gets nearer

Rho - Change of the option price as the interest rate changes; Most people ignore this

Looking at the greeks of the gambling tickets you buy is very useful to analyzing the ways you can make or lose money on them. Think TSLA will go up a modest amount? Buy a high-Delta call. Think GME is going to 🚀🚀🚀 1000% more? Look for a high Gamma call so your Delta gains accelerate as GME 🚀🌕. Do you feel like a vampire and want to have a steady income source from degenerate r/wallstreetbet gamblers on a stock you think will go flat (relative to historical volatility) over the next few months? Join theta gang and sell a high-Theta and high-Vega option!

**Market Makers**

The Black-Scholes model is a fancy mathematical model that describes a “perfect price” (a lot of caveats here) for a stock option. This is done by showing how every option written can theoretically be perfectly hedged by a series of purchases or short sells on the underlying stock. This means that theoretically, if there is a large gap between the theoretical price from Black Scholes and the actual price for an option, there is an “arbitrage” opportunity - this is where market makers come in.

Market makers are companies that provide liquidity to a market by offering to be counterparty to trades. This is especially useful in stock options, where a single ticker can have thousands of options, and there might be someone who wants to buy a GME 1/29 $1000c but no one is actually actively selling it. However, this option might be listed anyways and Citadel will sell you the call if anyone tries to buy it and then immediately hedge it. In fact, when you buy an option chances are you’re not actually buying it from its previous owner selling an option they already own, but from a market maker like Citadel (who is responsible for over 99% of all options volume in 3000 stocks).

So what happens when someone buys an option from a market maker? Since the market maker typically can’t (and probably don’t want to) take a position, meaning taking a directional bet if a stock goes up or down, they’ll immediately hedge the option they just conjured out of thin air by buying or shorting the equivalent number of shares such that the Delta of those shares is the same as the Delta of the option they wrote to remain Delta-neutral, so if the stock goes up or down their position value doesn’t change - this is called **Delta hedging**. Furthermore, as the stock price moves up (calls) or down (puts), they’ll need to buy or sell even more of those shares to remain Delta neutral since the Delta will change due to the option’s Gamma - this is called **Gamma hedging**.

### Putting It All Together - How options can be used as weapons of mass destruction against short sellers

Now we have the tools to understand how these two financial concepts put together can make billion-dollar hedge funds go bankrupt. Through Delta and Gamma hedging of market makers, buyers can have the effect of buying shares dozens of times the value they actually spent buying their option; a XYZ 4/20 690c can cost only $100 in premiums but causes the market maker to buy $2000 in the underlying stock to hedge against it. If you get enough retail investors to do this, they'll have the impact of billion-dollar whales on the market despite their small stimulus-check-funded portfolios.

Now, you do this on a stock that is heavily shorted, and with very little institutions actually holding real shares of these - making it harder for brokers to find shares to borrow, and you have yourself a weapon of mass financial destruction capable of making billions of Melvin’s money disappear in a single day and potentially have GME 🚀🚀🚀 to a trillion dollar market cap.

**How** r/wallstreetbets **Controls the Stock Market**

The one thing that’s interesting about all of this is r/wallstreebet’s unique position in being able to facilitate this weapon of mass financial destruction because

1. Most rich people or institutions too risk adverse to buy large amounts of out of the money options (unless you're Chamath or Elon)
2. This can only really happen on stocks that very few institutions (i.e. rich people) actually own, meaning it needs to be held / bought on mass by retail investors
3. In any other scenario where 1 and 2 happen to be true, this would be classified as market manipulation and be immediately shut down by the SEC

**My Positions**

r/wallstreetbets veterans may recognize me as the 🌈🐻 who wrote those long-ass 2000 word essays about how the [stock market is in a bubble](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) and loaded up on VIX calls last time you heard from me. Although I still stand by my thesis and stocks like GME, TSLA, and NKLA is just proof that we've reached the euphoria phase of it, I learned my lesson that I'm idiot trying to short it (for exactly the reasons described above) and got the fuck out of my position when VIX shot up back in Sept. Most of my ""real money"" has since been moved to gold and crypto, but because I'm a degenerate gambler, I still have a bit of money playing with /ES and a **calls on** [highly-shorted stocks](https://www.highshortinterest.com/) **with meme-stock potential** (i.e. vast majority held by retail investors). Now that I'm busy with work again, I probably won't be posting as frequently as I have had in the past, but you'll see me around from time to time :)."|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212617.csv|StockTicker|['DDDD']|[]|['$GME', '$BB', '$BBRY', 'DDDD', 'A', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'HTZ', 'GME', 'NIO', 'NKLA', 'A', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'A', 'TSLA', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'XYZ', 'GME', 'SEC', 'VIX', 'I', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'NKLA', 'I', 'VIX', 'I', 'ES', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'BBRY', 'TSLA', 'TSLA', 'HTZ', 'GME', 'NIO', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'TSLA']

This liability is secured by the assets in the party's margin account. When the liability exceeds the amount of assets in the margin account, they face a margin call. Provide additional money or securities to cover the gap or we will liquidate your position and bill you for the remainder.

The monumental discovery which is in process is as follows: When over 100% of shares are short, the long position is effectively backed by the shorts, and becomes an infinite loop. If the market cap of a stock is $50Bn, there are $50Bn in margin assets backing this price. Thus stock is in a perpetual state of fair value as long as the over 100% condition holds and the shorts have the assets, regardless of price.

So now the hedge funds find themselves in a Chinese finger trap. To push their fingers together means to liquidate their positions and take enormous losses. To pull their fingers is to continue to provide margin as the price increase until they reach bankruptcy and lose everything. In their hubris, they were trying to pull.

As these funds and brokers employ tons of smart phds to understand this math, they have undoubtedly realized this, and hence they want to cut the trap. They have restricted retail trading to prevent this limitless outflow, they are trying to bully the regulators into backstopping their position, they may halt trading.

What is the maximum fair market cap of GME? It is as much capital as these hedge funds want to throw away, lambs to the slaughter, before they throw in the towel, and its first come first serve. What is the AUM of the remaining short funds, 50Bn? 100Bn? 200Bn? more?

As we have seen time and time again, the behavior of market participants is not rationale and is difficult to predict. People are ignorant of this mathematical fact, crying about the fundamental value of the retailer on CNBC. But big money is smart, they will figure out exactly how big the pot is, and they will snap it up. Even a country could do it.

Disclaimer: I am not a financial professional, nor is this financial advice, I'm just pointing out that there is a fundamental misunderstanding of this financial math. Make your own choices and invest responsibly (only what you can afford to lose). Lord knows they are doing anything they can legal or not to shut this down.

TLDR: The Math of over 100% short interest allows for 100% arbitrage losses from the short funds. This creates the possibility for the greatest transfer of wealth of all time."|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212617.csv|StockTicker|['A', 'CNBC']|[]|['GME', 'AUM', 'CNBC', 'I']|['GME']

WSB isn’t about market manipulation, pumping stocks, or making gains; it’s about losing money with your friends and being gay with your dad. This is a very unique situation, and the best thing to do is just enjoy it. Fuck all the naysayers who claim WSB will never be the same again- things will be back to normal when normies lose their kid’s college fund and have to move into their wife’s boyfriend’s basement because some retard told them to buy puts on Amazon right before JPow steps down from the fed and Bezos is announced as his successor.

The media will get bored, as they always do, and we will go back to being a zoo. Thank you to the mods for their awesome work this week. If this place ever gets shut down (doubt it), I will immediately join the website that takes its place. This community cannot be replaced. Our shared culture is eternal. The eyes of the media, and even the fucking government, need to just let us be please. I want to see 18 year olds go from 5k to 500k, then back down to 0, and we all get to shout at them. I want to get banned for using one of the 3 c-words. I want auto mod to call me a retard. I want to see charity donations. I just wanna lose some money in peace, throwing it on a dream.

The logic that WSB is an organised community is a retroactive reassembling of the narrative. We have a healthy balance of bears and bulls, and plenty of people who call each other retarded for doing very detailed DD on stocks. Whether or not people agree with the DD or not is on them. 

Memes aside: I like this stock. I want to buy it. I have read the DDs and made an informed, individual decision. Do I want people to sell it? Of course not. I want them to make money. This does not amount to collusion any more than wishing well to a stranger on the street. Lazy media commentators can’t understand the DD? Blame it on a pump. People want to throw a political spin on it? Redistribution of wealth! 

Anyone who has been here more than a week knows that we redistribute our tendies into the pockets of Wall Street. That is it. Now, members of this sub get one win (okay, maybe TSLA could be considered a win too) and there suddenly needs to be a collective effort? No. Individuals made high quality posts, I liked the posts, I bought. Repeat this several times over. 

Any long-timers want to share their favourite historic losses on this sub? To show the media that at the end of the day, again, we are here to lose money gambling on a dream, and support the gay mods.

TLDR: the media suck. None of them are brave enough to break from the current narrative. I like you guys. Our shared memories are great. We are all retarded."|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212617.csv|StockTicker|['WSB']|[]|['ARE', 'WSB', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'WSB', 'DD', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'DD', 'TSLA', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['ARE', 'DD', 'DD', 'DD', 'TSLA']

There is no break in bills or rent and work is stagnant, To add to this a few months back both our cats got cancer at the same time, it has been a struggle managing vet visits and bills (we have spent at least 5k by now)

I have been lurking on this sub for a while and figuring out how it all works and what you guys have recently done is nothing short of amazing - leveling the field in this unjust world. This morning we bought a few shares of gamestop what we could afford, and you all helped pay for our cats one day cancer treatment. We didn’t have much to put in and only the belief in your movement made us take the small plunge. You have no idea how much this means to us . 

You are over here changing lives when there was no help or hope. You gave us hope . 
Please keep going - In our small way we are with you. Whatever we can put we are behind you. This brings back faith in humanity and what we can achieve together. Its been too long we have been push down with a knee on our neck and you are changing this. 
Our deepest thanks to all you retards( i see this is the common terminology here) but you are nothing short of amazing.

Thank you 🙏🏽

Edit/update:  I have been at a loss for words this morning after seeing all your messages , it has been really overwhelming. I wrote that message last night before bed because I just wanted to share what you guys did for us in one day by giving us hope that we can afford to continue treatments for both of them. 
I know “you just like the stonk” from the many comments, but it has meant a  lot more than that for us. From the bottom of our hearts I thank you for your well wishes and support.
 Just knowing that we are not alone gives the strength to push on forward. This has been a real example of humanity. We have not setup a gofund me for them because we didn’t  feel it was right to burden others, but from  some of your comments/advice I will do it today and if I am allowed I will post it here.

Here is what we need to do: file a complaint directly and send it to the SEC via email. I’ll provide a template. 


Email: help@sec.gov




Dear Securities and Exchange Commission, 

I’m writing to register a formal complaint against Melvin Capital Management LP for manipulation of security via abusive naked short selling. Thousands of investors have been affected by your lack of action to stop these hedge funds from predatory practices. I believe you have terribly failed your responsibilities. 

Melvin Capital Management LP has been continuously shorting GME to manipulate the share price as it has been observed in the past few days. Specifically on January 25, 2021, the following security was halted seven times due to continuous shorting and selling of shares to drive down the price of the security in real time. As you are aware, this is highly illegal and is considered to be manipulation of securities.

Due to the volatility created by Melvin Capital Management LP, honest investors such as myself are being targeted by discriminatory behaviour from the media and I truly believe that the events that have unfolded were conspired between several parties. This needs to be further investigated if you wish to uphold the laws that you practice. 

Regards, 

___________

455|l6fgbn|The other post about SLV is absolutely correct. Silver is by far the most manipulated market in the world. JPM just paid $1 billion fine for their manipulation and they brushed it off and kept doing it. The other post didn’t say how to cause the squeeze, here’s how to play it|t3_l6fgbn|0.94|134|134|hot|2021-01-28 00:55:29.000000|TheHappyHawaiian|34|DD|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6fgbn/the_other_post_about_slv_is_absolutely_correct/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6fgbn/the_other_post_about_slv_is_absolutely_correct/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6fgbn/the_other_post_about_slv_is_absolutely_correct/|"First here is the other post https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the_biggest_short_squeeze_in_the_world_slv_silver/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf

Second, everyone buy and hold GME through at least $1000 before buying silver because the shorts are still at 139% of the float so there is a technical reason to stay long until they really cover.

Third, the other post said to buy miners, but that won’t cause a silver squeeze. The miners will benefit from the squeeze, but buying miners alone does nothing to actually beat the manipulating banks at their own game in silver.

So here’s how you do it:

Buy SLV directly.  If you want options buy in the money or near the money to force true hedging (buying) by the market maker.  This is a very old and slower moving market than equities so unless you are buying leaps, SLV shares are the way to go anyways.  Alternatively, buy silver physically or even force delivery through purchasing futures if you are rich and can store it.  Physical silver purchases carry a premium over spot price though so you end up causing more physical silver to be purchased by simply buying SLV.

By purchasing SLV, more shares will be created and SLV will have to purchase massive amounts of physical silver to hold in their vaults because the etf has to remain backed by physical silver.  

Silver is a much larger market than GME, but the paper traded gold market is 100x the physical market.  If we force more physical purchase and delivery of silver, the paper traders will be required to buy it in real life and deliver it. Creating a positive feedback loop just like a short squeeze.

Lastly, the fundamental case is that government stimulus combined with fed money and reopening economy will cause inflation, and that government debt loads mean dollar debasement. Lest someone say we are manipulating the market (as big banks have literally been doing for decades). We like the stock!

Let’s get GME to the moon and then park all of the winnings in SLV. Could take a couple of months to fully moon as delivery of silver takes time but it really could go to $1000 from $25.  If GME took down a single hedge fund, this would take down JPM. 

Please share, it’s hard to break through right now 

Power and tendies to people!

Melvin and Citron had went as far as spreading blatant lies and having the discord for r/WallStreetBets shut down for nothing more than talking about stocks we like clearly violating our 1st amendment rights.

Apparently it's ok when the big hedge funds get together to plan what to invest in behind closed doors to ruin people's lives but when we the people discuss stocks openly to fight back their shady tactics we are ridiculed as racists and shut down from further being allowed to talk to one another.

Is there any action we can take to fight back the media lies? How can we show that we have done nothing illegal or racist? I'm blown away at the hate we have received from the establishment for playing the same game with the same rules but they can break those rules as they see fit and literally fabricate stories to shut us down.

This is not the American or human way as I believe in it and want to stand up for the community and the future of other communities. This will lay the path for future censorship for all communities if they win here.

EDIT:  I'm heated over this. It wasnt about race color or creed it was about making money from the 1% that's been fucking the rest of the world.

EDIT2: other than Elon he's one of us... Love that guy I about cried when I seen the satellite train."|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212617.csv|StockTicker|['WTF']|[]|['CNBC', 'I', 'I', 'I']|[]

But I have been seeing a lot of posts about ""Oh thank you WSB you have finally given me the money to afford x and my life is changed forever!"" Generally, this is awesome, and I am happy for whoever can finally afford something nice for themselves. You deserve it, king! (Especially if you are paying for a pet surgery or something like that, then you are an amazing person and I'm happy for you.) But, the fact of the matter is, if you didn't have enough money to pay for your rent and you finally can, then you probably shouldn't have been investing heavily in a high risk stock like GME. I am happy for you that you bought at 100 and sold for 300, but please understand that there is a high likelihood one of these days that GME will crash, and you will lose 90% of your investment. I just want to make it clear that you SHOULD NOT INVEST MONEY YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE. And even though it may have worked out this time, it may not in the future. The first one is always free kid.

What we're doing is investing exactly the way that investing should be done. This is the kind of shit that would make the founding fathers happy. 

Any American adult now has access to the stock market on their computer or phone, and can invest for free or close to free depending on your broker. This is true equality of opportunity, a market controlled by the average American.

We have invested in Gamestop for multiple reasons, all of which are logical and beneficial:

1. We see serious short term potential for Gamestop to succeed if their future plans of turning their stores into PC component purchasing and building stations see fruition.
2. Gamestop has been an important retailer for a long time, and is currently entering a phase where they need to innovate. We believe that this innovation is possible and will pay greatly.
3. We like Gamestop, and want the company to succeed. Purchasing their stock gives them a greater opportunity to successfully implement new ideas and plans.
4. We're free to put our money wherever the hell we want.

Anyone who portrays us as market manipulators or ""the bad guys"" doesn't understand the fundamentals of what the stock market should be and already has become. This is proof that investing has become accessible to the common man, and the market can no longer be manipulated by hedge funds and old money  billionaires without possible consequences.

I just started posting here for the first time a couple months ago but had been lurking for almost a year. I honestly don't give a shit if I am unable to post as my first comment was less than 90 days ago. New looks like a fucking Youtube or Twitch comments section. I have seen dozens of comments from people asking how to invest. Something drastic needs to happen because, honestly, I haven't seen the quality of a subreddit drop as much as this sub has the last few days. And it isn't the mods fault at all so far. It has gained an insane amount of popularity and followers and I would have no idea what to do. I just believe it's necessary that SOMETHING happens so that those that want to learn more about stocks can read comments from the more experienced here without spamming bottom of the barrel quality comments and posts.|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212619.csv|StockTicker|['I']|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'THING']|[]

558|l6gye5|Thoughts on the psychology of this battle, from Melvin's standpoint, why GME is so important (maybe to the entire world) possible outcomes, reasoning, and a nice helping of abstract autistic confirmation bias DD|t3_l6gye5|0.98|75|75|hot|2021-01-28 02:00:08.000000|brianfizzle|15|DD|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6gye5/thoughts_on_the_psychology_of_this_battle_from/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6gye5/thoughts_on_the_psychology_of_this_battle_from/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6gye5/thoughts_on_the_psychology_of_this_battle_from/|"Here's my DDD for GME (due dumb diligence), you've heard of r/ELI5 we'll I'm gonna explain this like *I'm* 5 and on ritalin so don't mind the crayons and lines. 




First thought: the groups of people with skin in the other side of this game are obviously panicking, duh, you can see clearly how every price increase or momentum shift gets cancelled out by a feeble attempt to course correct (among other things like limits set at round numbers like 200 and 250 and other shit that's beyond my genetically re-imagined autist monkey brain). This means what most people here say it means, that Melvin and whoever else are trying to scare off retail investors, reverse the momentum, whatever you wanna call it, they want their GME is kil wish to come true so they can make bank. What's troubling me and a lot of new retail investors, and awakening the gay bear is exactly HOW they're doing it. We're fucking winning and it's not even close, we've got these dinosaurs slurpin up the discarded nut juice from the 3 million used condoms per hour from the WSB boys finally being allowed to sleep in the bed with their wives after all these long years of sleeping in the mancave (pillow fort in the utility closet) every night. 🚀🚀🚀🚀



So why is this so suspicious? when has this redistribution EVER fucking happened? We're all baby faced autists throwing shit at the walls and screaming about tendies - how did they miss this possible outcome of their BIGLY risky play in which they would lose BILLIONS if someone caught wind of it? 



Did they get cocky? ""haha yeah we're boomers and we own the stock market no one can touch us so let's basically and then literally do something illegal for the 1squollionth time"" probably. This scenario looks likely. And we get the massive tendies of unlimited fortune III out of it. BUT:



Did they plan for this and we're on the roller coaster they designed to finally say ""you must be this rich to ride or you'll slide out and die""? Is this on purpose, to push retail investors out of the market or incriminate them in shady dealings? Could be. The evidence we have can go both ways. Perhaps they're intentionally making the price slowly climb, only to reveal they performed a reverse porsche maneuver or some shit and profit MASSIVELY off DOUBLED DOWN puts that seemed insane this whole time? 



No. 



We caught these fuckers with their pants down. I mean, *we* didn't. But someone did. And thanks to the speed of information in 2021, in a VERY unique time period where people both need money BAD and absolutely hate wealth-hoarding cock-dragons, a community with hundreds of thousands of ready-to-yolo retards called their bullshit. The bullshit that for decades has succeeded at not only destroying companies and putting people out of work, but profiting from it. Which is truly inspiring, but has really nothing to do with the company we're investing in. 



And that's why it'll work. This will be the last time a short squeeze of this nature happens. This will be the push that serves as a catalyst for more change to the state of the world than we've seen since the dawn of the internet. This is destroying the stock market as they know it, and they're fighting back as hard as they can. 



Hold. Set your limits. This is not financial advice. It will happen. They're on their last legs. They have so few legs that they're borrowing legs from other cum-sucking monsters that don't want this legendary tendie dimension flip to fluop. 




Which brings me to my second thought: how I know we're on the brink. They're pulling out all the stops. After hours today is seeing (so far) highs around 370 and lows around 300. There are an absolutely INSANE number of fraudulent accounts beefing up the amount of morons here and in the discord that could be seen as doing something illegal, distracting us, breaking reddit, or otherwise throwing a wrench into the transdimensional fucking super collider fueled goddamn rocketship that is GME. 



Remember the memes about how your mortgage, wife, kids, dog, and breakfast sandwich would net you $3.69 in-store gamestop credit? Imagine the life cycle of that meme, making it to the facebook accounts of boomers last year, prompting the market sentiment that made them confident that everyone hated GME enough to make them billions by betting they'd go out of business. Imagine that these crab mentality squish-slurpers are exactly as dumb as we think they are. Imagine they thought since the internet is against gamestop there's no way this can fail. This is the turning of the generational tide making its way to the stonk morket. 



It is for these reasons I'm diamond handing the ever loving fuck out of this play. I'm a canadian broke boy, but I put 2000 hard earned freedom points into 41 secret dimension mission gamestonk tickets and their deep fucking value is approaching what I make in a year AT A PRETTY GOOD JOB! this whole SYSTEM' s out of order! This could flip it forever. We'll see in the next few days. 




TL;DR: THE INFINITY SQUEEZE IS COMING. WE ARE THANOS AND WHEN WE SQUAOUAZE OUR ASSCHEEKS AS A COLLECTIVE IT WILL TURN FOES OF MANKIND TO DUST. THERE IS NO DENYING IT. STONK IS UP 134% TODAY AND THEY CAN BARELY MUSTER THE STRENGTH TO PUSH IT BACK DOWN MORE THAN 8% AFTER HOURS. i legally cannot say put your good boy points in or don't, but I'm HIV positive diamond handing this shit will take you to the tendie dimension. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💎✌️"|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212619.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['DDD', 'GME', 'GME', 'HOW', 'WSB', 'EVER', 'BIGLY', 'LIONS', 'III', 'IVELY', 'UBLED', 'DOWN', 'I', 'VERY', 'BAD', 'I', 'NSANE', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'AT', 'A', 'RETTY', 'GOOD', 'JOB', 'THE', 'INITY', 'UEEZE', 'IS', 'OMING', 'WE', 'ARE', 'HANOS', 'AND', 'WHEN', 'WE', 'OUAZE', 'OUR', 'HEEKS', 'AS', 'A', 'CTIVE', 'IT', 'WILL', 'TURN', 'FOES', 'OF', 'NKIND', 'TO', 'DUST', 'THERE', 'IS', 'NO', 'NYING', 'IT', 'STONK', 'IS', 'UP', 'TODAY', 'AND', 'THEY', 'CAN', 'ARELY', 'USTER', 'THE', 'ENGTH', 'TO', 'PUSH', 'IT', 'BACK', 'DOWN', 'MORE', 'THAN', 'AFTER', 'HOURS', 'HIV']|['DDD', 'GME', 'GME', 'EVER', 'III', 'GME', 'GME', 'AT', 'GOOD', 'ARE', 'IT', 'IT', 'IT', 'MORE']

This was during the ""dot com boom"" -- money was flying everywhere.

I hung out with a bunch of traders in one group who once paid my friend $150 just to watch him lick capsaicin off a spoon (the concentrated liquid part of hot peppers) and then all laugh as he had to chug milk. There was money flying everywhere. I was 17. For Christmas that year, I made $1800 in cash in tips from the guys that I worked for.

I would watch these degenerates come in early in the morning after going out all night, doing blow, shit their brains out from drinking, sometimes pass out in a chair, go stand on the trading floors, get in fist fights (I've definitely been knocked in the head in the Dow futures pit), and generally just act like animals.

These are the ""financial markets"" that everyone praises and bails out with our tax dollars. Everyone talks about their ""401k"" and our ""economy is so great"", the ""stock market is at an all time high"" -- let me tell you: none of it means shit, and everyone here figured it out. We finally have a means of communicating en masse, to take back the financial power from these dopes. I saw guys with barely a high school diploma, come in and get rich, just because it's all loaded and manipulated.

Our entire financial market is literally based on the whims of ex-frat boy cokeheads. They deserve everything that's coming to them.

New shorts are pilling in, the “news” are building a narrative that a bunch of millennials - as if we don’t have several prominent boomers among us - are “targeting” Hedge Funds in “chat rooms” (mIRC much?) to create an irrational bubble and that this is a perfectly orchestrated multi-billion dollar operation!

Wanna talk about irrational? Irrational is to value GameStop at $4, with ~$2 in cash per share, a few months before a new console cycle is launched. Irrational is to keep naked short selling well above its available free float (morning start shows the most accurate free float imo) a company that has completed a major share buyback, turning inventory into cash, paying back their 6% LT debt early and attracting a major activist (sup RC? You’ve been quiet lately). 

How come there were no “news” about this? Is everyone sleeping? How come Bank of America has had a price target of $2 for GameStop (sorry, BofA increase their PT to $10 today) for months? And by the way, what has FUNDAMENTALLY changed for BofA to increase 5 fold their valuation of GameStop? What a bunch or crooks.

You wanna know what’s not irrational?

- GME has $7b in sales in the end of a console cycle and amidst lockdowns. 

- Out of those sales +1b is e-commerce that is growing 300% YoY

-+ 50m power up members (amazon prime has 150m members)

- an established and functioning sales and distribution network worldwide

- a healthy balance sheet. 

All that while operating in an industry with a crazy TAM, with growth rates above 30% and with THE MOST DESIRABLE demographic. 


And seriously, a 3x EV/sales is a bubble for this? The e-commerce part of it alone should trade at this valuation. And let’s not forget that the only reason GME has not sold more in Q3 is because there is a shortage of product! Demand is not gonna evaporate. So discount that valuation to this year sales and you have a <1.5x time Sales/EV valuation.


So ask yourself one question:

Would you pay an +80% interest to remain short in this thesis?

We are literally changing people’s lives in here**. We are doing the shit the corrupt, greedy hedge funds claim but fail to do.

These shorting boomer fuckwads want to get rich by selling us their aged smegma, and they want us to spend our whole lives giving them money to do it. They want us to invest “responsibly” so that we’ll earn just enough to outpace inflation, maybe retire with a decent sum. That’s fucking lame, and it’s fucking boring. *I WANNA BE RICH NOW.* You think these hedge fund managers are investing responsibly like they tell their clients to do, hedging their bets, saving their money and living clean? They are balls deep in their 4th hooker and working on their third eight ball by lunch time (if they’re a junior partner). **WHY NOT US. I WANT TO BE RICH NOW.**

WSB is just a subreddit, AND YET IT’S SO MUCH MORE. We are a bunch of fucking retarded autists that have formed an unstoppable nuclear internet hivemind. Nearly 3 fucking million of us thinking, acting, encouraging, nurturing, and fucking HELPING each other.

It’s like every great struggle in history, all the way back to the biblical story of David vs. Goliath. The little man versus the behemoth. Us verses the boomer hedge fund big money shorting assholes who fuck us over time and time again with impunity, always safely escaping with their golden parachutes to numb their emotions with a Tony Montana-sized pile of cocaine in their penthouse suites overlooking Central Park as two hookers spray diarrhea over their faces like oil spewing from the Exxon-Valdez.

AND THEY THINK THEY'RE FUCKING BETTER THAN US. They DESPISE us. For our youth, for our energy, for our love, for our autism. They have nothing. Understand that. They are no better, no smarter than us. Our weaponized hivemind of fearless retardation TERRIFIES them. WE DON’T FUCKING NEED THEM ANYMORE. THEY ARE LYING AND MANIPULATING THE MARKET AND TRYING EVERY TRICK BUT WE WILL ALWAYS CATCH THEM BECAUSE WE ARE FUCKING STUPID BUT THEY ARE EVEN DUMBER. IF LITERAL BLINDFOLDED MONKEYS CAN INVEST BETTER THAN THEM, WHAT THE FUCK DO WE HAVE TO FEAR.

**We stay in this together. We do it for each other. We all win this together.**

We do it for the unknown Redditor who uses his winnings to pay off his student debt. For the anonymous construction worker who downloaded Robinhood and, in one week, earned enough to pay off his debts and buy his family a new Toyota. We do it for our lord and savior DFV who is watching his return vary by the millions without flinching. Who showed us all that if we dare to YOLO like a retard, anything is possible. We all have it within ourselves to accomplish something great, something truly bigger than ourselves, if we just work together.

Remember that one day, we will all be old and gray. Our bodies will grow frail as the years go by and eventually we’ll be stuck reminiscing on the lives we’ve lived. Long after the fires of youth have faded from our eyes, we will remember truly being part of something amazing and changing the lives of MILLIONS of people for the better. As we think back on the $GME era, a smile will creep across our wrinkled old faces AS WE RELAX IN OUR RETIREMENT CASTLES ON FUCKING MARS WHILE 12 MARTIAN GODDESSES GIVE US TENTACLED TONGUEBATH MASSAGES BECAUSE WE RODE THE $GME ROCKETSHIP POWERED BY PAPA MUSK AND BOOMER TEARS ALL THE WAY TO THE FUCKING RED PLANET AND MADE ENOUGH TO FUCKING BUY IT WHEN WE GOT THERE.

I don’t care how much they ripped you off with trade ins. They ripped you off because you were retarded then and still retarded now, but they have paid us back beyond our imagination. What is happening now is a once in a life time event that will go down in history. If GME has benefited you financially at all, please make all your video game purchases with GAMESTOP.

&#x200B;

Yo I gotta say in my 2-3 years in WSB, this is by far the most insane thing I've ever witnessed. Every morning I wake up with cum leaking out of the tip of my dick. Tonight I had a wet dream thinking of Melvin sitting in his $300 robe, bawling out of his mind, while watching his wife pack up her things to leave him - as mine once did. How the tables have turned.

With that, I have a proposal for you baboons. ~~If~~  \- When GME hits 1k,  I propose a celebration of the retardism that brought us together. Many 6 and 7 figure men will be made in the upcoming weeks, so we better start acting like ones. Let's fly ourselves to Cuba and go apeshit - the greatest afterparty known to man. There will be drugs, alcohol, prostitutes,  autism, and most importantly - lots. and lots. of tendies."|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212619.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['GME', 'I', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I']|['GME', 'GME']

1. **Don't spam stocks.** People love to find undervalued/overvalued stocks but spamming them is not going to do shit. Instead, do a well-researched opinion document and post it online so people can discuss/check what YOU saw that made the stock valuable in the first place.
2. **We are not a pump and dump**. For the past days, r/wallstreetbets has been painted as a pump and dump group which explicitly is forbidden in this subreddit. These past days mods have been working tirelessly to remove all content that violate the subreddit rules.
3. **We are not an educational center**. We get it-you're new and don't know where to start, but creating a thread asking for help is not the way. If threads asking for basic understanding were allowed this subreddit would be clogged with questions. You can easily google all your questions, and watch countless YouTube tutorials to learn.

Now, I know what you're thinking, [u/Black-Irish-Bastard](https://www.reddit.com/u/Black-Irish-Bastard/) that's easy; it's obviously infinite - AND THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT TOO - that is until I realized that the symbol for infinity is just a sideways 8 (S C I E N C E) and that's a Melvin-level bullshit number so deeper we go...

The next logical stop was $420.69 - AND AGAIN - I thought I had it - and I may well have, BUT THEN, in our hour of need, **P A P A M U S K** drops Fat Man and Little Boy right into Melvin's asshole with one, glorious tweet and I knew that price would only signify the gravitational sling shot that sends us straight to Alpha Fucking Centauri.

So, while cleaning the cake out of my pants, I decided to watch an educational film on ""How to Stonk"" in a feeble attempt to add even the slightest wrinkle to my perfectly smooth brain. I immediately pass out after trying to walk and count at the same time.

I come to about halfway through the movie and there *HE* is - in all his omnipotent glory - [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/). He beat on his chest and hummed all of the universe's deepest secrets to me and I wept. Then, I heard the paramedic say something about internal bleeding (yeah, idiot, that's where the blood is supposed to be, idiot) and as the blinding light surrounding my celestial guide began to fade, I realized who it was...

# DFV - IS - Matthew Fucking McConaughey.

It really was so obvious and I'm ashamed it took me this long to figure it out, I mean, have you ever seen DFV and McConaughey in the same room???

As that magnificent realization took hold I began to connect the dots. Matthew McConaughey’s filmography at the time of GameStop's peak popularity - 2013/2014 - has already shown us the future!

2013: *Wolf of Wall Street* \- *primo autism* (chef's kiss) and the inspiration for many a [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) drool-bib wearing retard.

2013: *Dallas Buyers Club* \- gets FULL. BLOWN. AIDS from fucking 🌈🐻 like Melvin.

2014: *Interstellar* \- random blue collar dude 🚀🚀🚀 launches himself into a fucking BLACK HOLE and punches a bunch of dumbass books off a shelf with DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS 💎💎💎🙌🏻💎💎💎.

So there you have it with absolutely flawless logic and air tight facts - **THE OPTIMUM EXIT PRICE IS $2014** 🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎🙌🏻💎💎💎🚀🚀🚀.

Now, with my expertly crafted sell limit locked in and my newly wrinkled brain (the doctors are calling it a ""fracture"" which I guess is doctor talk for like a *really* smart wrinkle), I'm just sitting on my front porch in a SpaceX helmet I got from Elon and a hospital gown, waiting for Matty Ice to pull up in that sweet ass Lincoln Navigator so he can pop the back and let the Dino-shaped tendies pour out onto my lawn - then it’s off to the launchpad boys - see ya there. 🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎🙌🏻💎💎💎🚀🚀🚀"|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212620.csv|StockTicker|['THE', 'ONLY', 'GICAL', 'EXIT', 'ATEGY']|[]|['ROUGH', 'AKING', 'EARCH', 'AND', 'EMELY', 'ISTIC', 'EVELS', 'OF', 'IENCE', 'MAGIC', 'I', 'HAVE', 'LATED', 'THE', 'TIMUM', 'EXIT', 'VALUE', 'HEAR', 'ME', 'OUT', 'I', 'AND', 'S', 'WHAT', 'I', 'OUGHT', 'TOO', 'I', 'S', 'C', 'I', 'E', 'N', 'C', 'AND', 'AGAIN', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'BUT', 'THEN', 'P', 'A', 'P', 'A', 'M', 'U', 'S', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'DFV', 'IS', 'I', 'DFV', 'I', 'FULL', 'BLOWN', 'AIDS', 'BLACK', 'HOLE', 'AMOND', 'CKING', 'HANDS', 'THE', 'TIMUM', 'EXIT', 'PRICE', 'IS', 'I', 'X', 'I']|['HEAR', 'OUT', 'S', 'TOO', 'S', 'C', 'E', 'N', 'C', 'P', 'P', 'M', 'S', 'FULL', 'X']

If you think you’re gonna sell GME anytime soon, give your phone to your wife’s boyfriend. Stop being a bitch and remember you’ve got Diamond hands for a reason and these billionaires are moments away from a life they thought they’d never have to live.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g8VPDB6qZA



You heard that right. The Macro Fundamentals are going to shoot GME up. u/DeepFuckingValue is a God and all the other DD is mostly legit, but there’s something no one is talking about: **Money Multipliers.** If you don’t know what it is, it doesn’t matter, but you might as well know why this ship ain’t stopping.

What is a Money Multiplier? Money Makers, Banks, and Institutional Investors create value in the economy that normies like us can’t. They take your money and stocks and instead of letting them sit, those greedy fucks re-invest to turn a quick buck on money that isn’t theirs. But it doesn’t stop there, the next Big Boy that gets their hand on that money/stock re-invests that too. So at the end of the day that $1.00 you invested can become $10.00, even though you get returns on only $1.00 and take legitimate risk.

Now, is this illegal? No. Does this create value in the Market? Yes. It’s called a **Money Multiplier.** Now you know.

For the Normies: this action multiplies the value of money in the Market. 

For the Apes: your 1 dollar becomes 3. They take your 1 dollar and turn it into 3, give you back your dollar at the end, give another dollar to the CEO of COCKHEAD Hedge Fund, and then profit that third dollar. If you don’t understand that, that’s okay, we still accept you.

But Daddy? I want tendies! Strap that belt and listen before I pull mine out.

**All major investment institutions** engage in these practices. It is standard. The degree is variable, but the practice is standard. This means, that all institutions are connected. Why? Because all these institutions are creating value from point of value that traces through all the institutions involved. 

* You invest 1 dollar. 

* Your Broker reinvests that 1 dollar into another security.

* Hedge Fund Dickweed invests that dollar to another Fund.

* Sister Fucker Fund invests that dollar to Melvin.

* Melvin is broke like my dad after we got fucked in 2009 and can’t do shit with it LOL (how’s it feel?).

But what happens when you pull that dollar out? It’s gone. No one gets that value. So in general, there are millions upon millions of investments predicated on Money Multipliers. This creates a giant web, where all banks and Hedge Funds are connected, because if a few big boys go out, so do their values, which decrease the value of the Market and decrease the value of the entire economy. 

If a major player who acts as a Money Multiplier goes out, this means the chain is altered and the total amount of value in the economy drops. I.e. prices go down because there is less value in the economy, which lowers prices everywhere, and finally lowers a Private Institution’s buying power. 

Look at it this way. If 10% of all money got taken out of the Stock Market, what would happen? The fall in prices would be much bigger than 10% because 1 dollar can be used to create the value 5. This would lead to a fall bigger than 10% of value, and people would be spooked, pulling out EVEN MORE real dollars, which would lead to a decrease greater than the cash they pull out because the Money Multiplier effect is also taken away. And guess what that leads to? No. Not tendies, dipshit. That causes more people to pull out and that is a self fulfilling prophecy. This is what it means to be **too big to fail.**

Understood? I know, I know, how do we make tendies off of this? Just wait.

**This isn’t new information.** This is basic Undergraduate Economic shit. The **Big Chunkers,** and I mean **BIG CHUNKERS** (think of your major banks and Investment institutions) know not to get fucked in these webs after 2008. **They know** how fucked everyone would be if they got caught bagholding this because it would reverberate everywhere because they really influence the economy. But they don’t care about you. They know that if they are fucked it’ll affect their values and they don’t want that.

What does this mean? They’ll act like they can continually extend credit and try to salvage their Friends’ shorts, but they can’t. They know that even if they want to, they can’t come to help their poor fallen rich friends because if they do, they’re screwed even more and they’re going to screw all of their other rich friends too if they end up getting caught. We caught them.
The big boys know they can’t come in and bag hold. If they have diamond hands, they’ll have loss porn greater than anything we’ve seen and so will the entire economy. They know they have to **GTFO or stay out.** 

So what happens now? The DD from all the others reign true. The squeeze will come. We can outlast them. What else are we going to do in goddamn Pandemic? I’m here to tell you that Prince John and his chronies can’t come in to save his guards from Robinhood, Little John, and WSB. This is why the squeeze will come, there’s no out. But wait, there’s more information you need to know.

The Big Lie

If you haven’t seen it already, they’re running smear campaigns saying everything from Foreign interference to a new bubble. No. We have to launch our own counter campaign and educate the people around us IRL what is happening. That’s the only way we fight the misinformation. We’re in our echo chamber and we know the truth, but to stop from being regulated into oblivion we have to let people know the truth. 

If you don’t tell your friends and family, then who is CNBC? Usually the first piece of information someone hears dictates their perception of the issue. Please, as much as it is your duty to HOLD it is your duty to EDUCATE. If everyone knows the truth, then what happens when everyone floods their representatives and social media arguing for the little guys? 

We’ve seen the power of the MAGA mob to try and overturn an election. They had the whole Republican Party in their grasp. We’re stronger, we’re retarded and we have the tendies to prove it. We did this. We can do anything.

Don’t forget! Everyone got fucked in 2008. If they know the truth, they won’t bend over and accept this BS from shills like CNBC and the Big Boys. The people have to stand up and make the biggest stink in the world, and that’s how we top this off in the history book. We don’t let them get the last laugh. We don’t let them screw us over in the lawbooks too.

I don’t know about you boys, but I’m going to buy my mom that house we lost 12 in 2009.

625 shares of GME. I’m going interstellar, I don't know about you.


SEC here too? Maybe you can learn something from us and target the people who actually manipulate markets and ruin lives? These people cause generational trauma and incalculable suffering by ridding people who actually add value into the economy into the ground. Please do your job.

TLDR: 🚀🚀🚀Macro market fundamentals ensure Big Players stay greedy and the squeeze happens. We need to tell people what’s happening so we combat the Propaganda and new laws don’t fuck us and future generations. SEC, come on now...

Come down the rabbit hole with me.|t3_l5ws97|0.98|1804|1804|hot|2021-01-27 07:56:25.000000|dwarfboy1717|398|Discussion|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ws97/friday_12921_gme_expiry_date_means_nothing_dont/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ws97/friday_12921_gme_expiry_date_means_nothing_dont/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ws97/friday_12921_gme_expiry_date_means_nothing_dont/|"*Note: I am mostly summarizing the aggregate of explanations currently floating around about the 1/29/21 option expiry date. I don't claim any knowledge. This is not investment advice. Do your own research, don't invest what you can't afford to lose, and if something feels wrong it probably is.* 

**TL;DR: This isn't about options (yet), it's about shares, and Institutional Investors are playing a dangerous game by convincing us (some of y'all have bought in without realizing it) that a magical short squeeze has some 3-day time limit, that Friday is somehow the end game, and are hoping that when investors don't see a $5,000 short squeeze by next week they will fold and take their gains at a ""reasonable"" double-digit stock price. Don't believe them. They can survive through mid-late February before the true short squeeze smashes upward. And I'll be ready.**



**THESIS:** If institutional investors can (1) convince retail investors to sell stock at reasonable prices and (2) convince their lenders to wait, then the 0.01% get richer.



**JUSTIFICATION:** There is so much public sentiment (passion, enthusiasm, excitement, anger, whatever) surrounding short (~1 day) price movements*, and Friday's expiring options (these are also end of month contracts), that it seems like big clever money may be trying to artificially create a sort of bear trap for shareholders. 

Whatever happens in the next week or so (crest to $700? crash to $60?) almost means nothing in the long term, but could fool investors into giving these guys CHEAP ways out of their 140% float short interest positions. Remember, these are people who have been dumping tons of money for a long time, shorting the stock when it was *in the single digits*. They've been hoping for a GameStop bankruptcy, and manufacturing one as best they can. 



**IT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME:** Remember the VW infinite squeeze, where we saw **weeks** of crazy price movement before the actual peak. And that is a mild case, as most of the shares were held by an entity with legal, competitive, and strategic reasons and obligations forcing them to hold shares and **artificially reducing the float, or available shares for trading**. This reduced supply caused the short squeeze. 

However, this time around we've got a huge short interest, much much larger by comparison than that from VW's 2008 peak, to the tune of **140% of shares available for trading (float)**. They've massively overreached, and are going to pay the price for that. **But they haven't yet.**



**SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S A CHANCE:** This time, however, if the big dogs can shake shareholders hard enough, weak links break and paper hands fold and a fantastic long term play starts to seem out of reach. The market manipulation wins. 



**DARE TO BELIEVE:** Unfortunately for the shorts, GME has [real long term prospects](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) to revolutionize the gaming industry for consumers, and now has the attention and potential equity momentum (if they play it smart, which I think the new leadership will) to make this a reality. 

From that link above:
>In GME's case the rise in the stock price itself will likely result in fundamental improvements to the underlying economic metrics of the company. 

I believe. 

However, if the shorts can fight, sneak, manipulate, and otherwise adjust the share price down this week then they start to see light at the end of the tunnel. They make 2-3 week plans for doing the same thing. For them, prices don't have to bottom back out, they just have to convince enough people to sell that they buy thrmselves a few weeks before a short squeeze really takes them all under. 

*Some of this price movement is shorts covering, but much is actual legitimate investment between retail investors and other institutional investors who have seen the light. Remember, TSLA didn't get to where it is because one company made some bad short positions. But if GME shorts can convince everyone that a 3-day squeeze is all they get until GME crashes to some ""normal"" level, then they win. 

Everyone getting hyped about Friday is playing into their hands. Yeah maybe some will need to take gains after a Friday pop, but a smart long-term hold position on GME is what they're really afraid of. And I want to be a shareholder in GME's future, as many wanted to be with TSLA. And sure, maybe if everyone else thinks that way too, there may be an incidental short squeeze that wrecks the uber wealthy in mid-late February along the way. 

**Again, I am not claiming to be knowledgeable or insightful, just commenting my best guesses. Nobody knows the future. This is not investing advice.**

A bunch of Asperger's, WoW playing, poor ""kids"" managed to cause an epic squeeze in $GME. Make no mistake you have the attention of the big boys NOW.

&nbsp;

Now an absolute giant in the hedge fund world has gotten in, and it is against WSB. Ken Griffin (he has a camera in his office that shows his luxury car collection in the garage) may not be a name you know, but he is  a HUGE name in the hedge and quant fund world. After today and likely tomorrow, he is at risk of losing 2 Billion plus in his fund. I repeat he will NOT let this happen.

&nbsp;

These are the type of guys who do insider trading for fun at their country club. They front run clients, put out fake news stories, have direct links to the SEC board, and would literally murder everyone in here to increase their personal wealth.

&nbsp;


**What to expect  from them next:**


1. Convince (strongarm) the SEC to completely HALT trading on GME. They will make up a bullshit excuse, and force the exchange to stop allowing trades on the stock.

2. Hire big name attorneys, and force reddit to shut down WSB   
3. Pressure $GME executives to issue NEW shares at this price, and bail the shorts out. This is pretty easy for them to do. You have to understand almost all the people at this level of wealth know each other. Its a small club. 

&nbsp;



**What can you do to stop this:**

1. Bring attention to their tactics via going to the media (Twitter, NYT, Senator Elizabeth Warren or the like)

2. File SEC complaints that show that NAKED short selling is happening on GME, and is creating an actual organic move. There are more shares SHORT than their are FLOAT (traded in every day trading). This means if they covered their shorts they would have to buy every single share outstanding, and another 30% that are not actively traded.

Not only because this has never happened before, but also, because there are only two scenarios:

1. We sell, the price dips, firms buy the shares they need to fulfill their shorts at a discounted price, everything ends and GME dips into oblivion, leaving countless people with losses.
2. We **HOLD**, and firms have no option but to buy their shares, price SKY ROCKETS, and we all get rich because the **stock price is backed up** by these firms' money.

The reason no one talks about what's next is because they have tried saying it the price will dip, and nothing happened because **we kept holding**; and they won't talk about the other scenario because it would confirm their L and encourage people to **buy more**.

The big firms are absolutely fucked, just think about the shady shit they have tried to do over the past few days, the huge BILLIONAIRE loans they have been asking for and BLOWING IN A SINGLE DAY, and the fucking market halt they tried pulling earlier today.

We are winning. Stay strong, buy and sell GME, it will reach as much as we want it to.

Silver is probably the most (naked) shorted commodity on earth. The bullion banks are doing their best to short this thing into oblivion. 

But this will end now. $AG is essentially $GME for Silver, highest short float in the sector, nice leverage to silver, and just broke out above 10 year resistance too. Already 17% up after hours because people are starting to notice. Get this thing going, and once the people buy in, we take over the whole silver market and force the fuckers out of their short positions. This will be the march to august 2020 bullrun all over again. Daddy Powell is flooding the market with fiat dogshit, and inflation is just lurking around the corner. It's literally free money.

The banks are so fucking loaded, that with every 1$ the price of silver goes up, they are bound to lose around $200 million. Let's get this thing to a 100$ and show the suits who is in charge.

I'm simply sharing my own opinion and research. You are free to make up your opinion and decide to do whatever you want with your money.*

---------------------------

## **Status of GME 1/26. Why buying GME shares is a great idea.**

1. Elon Musk has been tweeting about GME. That brings **TSLA buyers** in, and a huge amount of wealth. What you saw in aftermarket was a glimpse of TSLA buyers.

2. **Wednesday will rally. Thursday will rally. Friday will be even crazier**. The $115 and $200 calls are very likely to expire ITM on Friday 1/29. Maybe even the newer 320 calls. This will trigger a gamma squeeze on Monday 2/1. Similar to the gamma squeeze of Monday 1/25!

3. **Shorts lost $5B today** 1/26 alone. Shares to borrow are rapidly tanking. Fees increasing. They are on their last rope. Older shorts are about to cover. Newer shorts probably just shit their pants. Melvin lost its $2.75B investment from yesterday (retards). Rumors of Melvin considering bankruptcy ahead of the short squeeze coming up -- they are about to lose their whole fund with the cover.


4. Again, the **gamma squeeze happening on Monday 2/1**. It's absolutely happening. Basically, this will force Market Makers to buy more shares of GME in order to cover for the 115$ and 200$ calls. More shares they buy, the less shares available to short. Meaning? SHORT SQUEEZE.

5. **Short squeeze is on the near horizon.** Could be this week/Friday. Next week. Or the week after. But the shorts are on their total last leg. Today was bloody for them.

So! Those 200c 2/19 calls look very yummy right about now. [320 calls](https://optionstrat.com/build/long-call/GME) are being released tomorrow as well. Just my opinion here.


## **tl;dr:**

## **1. BUY SHARES WITH CASH. TURN OFF SHARE BORROWING. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**
## **2. DIAMOND-HANDS ALL THE WAY 💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋**

THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. FUCK YOU.

The short interest on the stock is over 100%. That means Wall Street got greedy, borrowed and then reborrowed shares to expand their short positions with the hopes of cracking the stock.

Wall Street did not expect good news to come from GME, but it did. They decided to react with GREED and INCREASED their short positions to manipulate the markets and force the price down.

Now some simple supply and demand: The demand to borrow the stock is MUCH larger than the supply, so what can you - my fellow autistic tendy hungry cuckholding retard, do? If you buy shares (not call options, or CFDs) you will further restrict the supply of the shares that can be borrowed for greedy short positions.

Demand continues to be huge, therefore the price will sky rocket.

This is not speculation, this is economics. This is George Soros versus The Bank of England.

So say it with me, can't stop, won't stop, Game Stop.

Very simple reason to love BlackBerry or BB in the short term future and long term future.

1. They have a mega deal with Amazon that’s still a go.

2. The future is safety and cyber security. Blackberry entire company direction has switch to software solutions in cyber security. This will cause a huge growth in the short term and long term future.

He kept saying GME had no chance to pass $60 today because of hedge funds and such. I can’t bringing up that a short squeeze was possible. 

Today we argued abt GME. I told him it was going to the moon, talked about the short sellers, shitron and such. He called WSB a bunch of idiot millennials who will go broke, said the same thing about tesla. Today I had the honor of telling him to check GME when the ticker was at +79%. He stared at me pissed off and I said “how are your puts now e-trader”.

Ik the dudes a ton smarter then me on economics I just thought it was funny

This is a big moment. A tug of war between tradition and the future.

Hedge fund managers live in the past, and continue to look down upon the retail investors. They truly believe that we, the average retail investors, don't know anything about finances or the market (which may be true), and we're just gambling our money away.

We don't know any better. WE NEED HEDGE FUND MANAGERS TO TELL US WHAT TO DO! SAVE US!

This is the world they want to live in. This was the past.

Remember that scene from the Sopranos, where Tony's wife calls to buy 5000 shares of Webonics, after she was manipulated emotionally to so?  Institutions and hedge funds want us to be stuck in that world.

They're scared of the future.

They're scared because, so much information is available for free now. THere's no more fees for trading. We have large communities that discuss stocks and trading openly.

We can think and make decisions for ourselves, which scares the FUCK out of old school institutions and hedge funds.

Fuck them all. This affects every single one of you, whether or not you're holding $GME.

TLDR: Fuck hedge funds. This is a crosspoint into the future.

What you're seeing is an annoying amount of shilling of 4 tickers. Sure some of this is us, but most of it is you. The noobs know nothing else but spam. They haven't done any DD, and are just using a herd mentality to spam our sub into oblivion. It will work at first, with sheer numbers, but it's very likely most of you will experience your first pump and dump. You can expect this for GME once DFV post that he has exited his positions entirely.

Here's what I recommend some of you new guys do to stay ahead of this. It wasn't too long ago when the most loved tickers were ARK etfs, TSLA, ICLN, any FAANG, PLTR, PTON, TDOC, SQ, PLUG, ZM, DKNG and so on. You can go back a few weeks to see this for yourself. I have good news for you. Many of these much loved tickers are experiencing a dip that us autist only wished for a few weeks ago. When things go back to normal, and the next memes are being thrown around, one thing will always remain the same, WE LOVE TECH. WE LOVE ELON AND WE LOVE AUNT CATHIE. Yes, we love bald bezo too and all these tickers I mentioned earlier.

Of course always do your own DD, and understand short plays from long plays. Ask around. What LEAPS do you have? This 1990s party wont last forever. Always stay one-step ahead, and buy the fucking dip.

I'm not going to claim I know the exact legal arguments, but if WSB were to be shut down, they would claim it was because it had some negative financial impact on the hedge funds. It would have the implication that people can't gather on an online forum to discuss stock market activities just because the retards at some hedge funds decided to make millions on betting against companies. 

Suddenly freedom of speech would be shut down by the government because the ""peasants"" started to play the market like a casino in the same way the hedge funds have been doing and profiting off of for years. We won't let that happen without a fucking fight.

Now listen up bozos we know you're here. Can you fuckers just do your jobs for once and investigate all of those billionaire hedge funds that over-shorted certain stocks and caused all of this? There is nothing to look at here. We are simply playing the game hedge funds have been playing which has enabled them to screw over the American people for decades now. Example 2008. I'd assume you fuckers know why certain securities are trading higher than normal. Simple supply and demand. They want to cover their 140% shorts which should be **ILLEGAL but it's not because you don't do your fucking jobs**, but we're diamond handing. These hedge funds collaborated with brokers just this morning to halt trading of certain tickers. That is what you should investigate. That is manipulation. It's like playing a game, laughing when you're winning but turning off the console when you're losing. Why? Why is it a problem when the average American can make money in the stock market but elites do it no questions asked **WHILST SCREWING PEOPLE OVER**?

Now to WSB, these noobs who joined 3 days ago are trying to divert our attention from some of our OG ETF stonkz, example PLTR and BB. All I can say is, United we stand, divided we fall.

I am now 37, and of my favorite things to do with my son is grab a JUICY BURGER (that's what he calls fast food) and hit up our local gamestop. There's nothing more rewarding than letting him pick out 2 or 3 games/toys/magazines that he can pick up, examine, smell, or read.

My son would be absolutely devastated if these greedy investment firms were able to manipulate the market and push GME out of business for their own personal gain. I genuinely believe something will be lost if we lose SPECIALIZED retail stores. I KNOW I can buy games from [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com/). I KNOW that it's probably $2 cheaper at Walmart. But it's just not the same.

Not only do I believe in GameStop, but I believe they have the ability to become the Williams-Sonoma of gaming. This whole GME experience has awakened something in me. I fully intend to support more specialized/boutique stores in the future. THANKS WALLSTREETBETS!

I am a man of the people; I have 14,000 Karma and have been active on this sub for well over 1 year. 

\*\* BEGIN BIG DICK DILIGENCE\*\*

This is prime buying szn for Castor Maritime and I would absolutely hate to miss the next goddamn 🚀 to paying off my mounting law school debt. For this reason, I’m going long on 20,000 shares to start. This summer, I’m looking to sink another 40,000 shares in them. 2021 is going to be a big year for maritime shipping.

Why is it a good buy, you might ask? Let me fucking tell you. The maritime shipping industry hemorrhaged during COVID and lost 4.1%. It is on track for at least a 4% gain industry-wide this year. The industry itself is gearing to boom. Freight prices are increasing and importers have signaled their willingness to pay the increased rate. CTRM is going to have unprecedented growth in the next two quarters as a result.

With Biden’s clean energy agenda coming down the pike, reformation of transportation emissions guidelines are to be expected. CTRM operates six dry bulk carriers with one capsize carrier being acquired just last week. The dry bulk carriers are among the lowest carbon-emitting vessels available for maritime transport.  CTRM is already positioned well for this environmental leap.

It’s also stupid fucking cheap at $.45 per share. Most analysts with more than feces in their skull will see the $3+ one year target potential organically. If WSB gets behind them, anything is possible. Look at the lucky fuckers who got in at $.19 a few months ago. I bet life sucks from their sheep's wool jump seat window in their Gulfstream G650. 

Get in loser, we aren’t going to the Moon or Mars. We are going to the motherfucking Andromeda Galaxy 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit: u/floatyfish brought to my attention the fact that their 2005-built dry bulk carrier is called “Magic Moon.” This should be enough DD for most of you.

They had [13.1 bn AUM](https://aum13f.com/firm/melvin-capital-management-lp) as of Mar 2020 (assuming this doesn't change), that's a **loss of $3.9 bn as of Jan 22 2021**.
* During this time, GME increased $46.95 (from $17.9 to $64.85). **AKA for every $11.95 increase in GME price, Melvin loses $1bn.**

GME price as I am writing this is $103.46. That means:

* **Since the $2.75bn bailout, Melvin has lost another $3.2 bn or 25%.**

Keep the pressure coming. We are doing this! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit: **When $GME hits \~$175 it'll be game fucking over for Melvin.** \-100% loss. They can't restart.

""... Short Sellers Down $5B (And Counting) In 2021"" - [https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/21/01/19330873/gamestop-short-sellers-down-5b-and-counting-in-2021](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/21/01/19330873/gamestop-short-sellers-down-5b-and-counting-in-2021)

Apparently, Citadel knows best and they can just manufacture shares. But not to worry, because these large banks will just get a bailout on tax payer money just like they did when they were selling credit default swaps and fraudulently manipulating the housing market. So while now it's $5B, it could very well be $10B next week or even $20B because they just have free money from the Fed.

Highlights of DD:

* With at least 71.2M shares shorted as of Dec. 31 and now likely at least 78M (a 10% increase), this means that deep pockets are ready to play and play big (e.g. willing to go up to -$20B).
* With only -$5b in losses, it would require another 500% increase from what it is today to push the shorts out, that's $1,000. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
* With so much equity growth, it has enough capital to do eliminate debt entirely, reinvest in a newer and better business model, and prove that they can actually earn this money back plus some allowing it's fundamentals to increase to the value it's been raised to. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
* I would be utterly shocked if it did not split at $400 back down to $50 to allow more ramp up. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Here's a graphic summary (couldn't embed in post):

🚀🚀🚀[https://i.redd.it/nkbmyfj8dtd61.png](https://i.redd.it/nkbmyfj8dtd61.png) 🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

**Clarify - What is a Stock Split**: Stock split doesn't mean that you lose value. If the stock splits at $400 at an 8:1 ratio, that means for every 1 share you have, you will now have 8 shares. So if you buy 50 shares tomorrow at $200 for a total of $10k and the stock rises to $400, you still have 50 shares with a value of $20k. But then it splits at 8:1, you will have 400 shares (50\*8) and the price will be adjusted to $50 still keeping the same value of $20k. The shares shorted will increase as well so the shorts will have the same outstanding obligation and will have to buy back the same amount in $$$ to cover their position. Options holdings are adjusted and strike prices adjust so you control the same amount of $$$ too. This just makes it easier for more retail investors to get in adding more 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.

Everyone is making A LOT of money. I am one of those people. I have a great feeling that there is going to be a substantial shift of wealth distribution, and this comes with some considerations.  

No matter how small, we should all use some of this money to help fix our destroyed economy. Whether that means donating to important causes, investing strategically in areas that need it, or taking steps to use the capital to support small business - we are taking a lot of power from the hands of people that have actively and repeatedly drove us into the ground. We are taking over the market in a big way. Dont allow yourself to be blinded by greed and reincarnate another generation of boomers. Take ethical responsibility and focus, and see this as the historic upset this is. We have the power now, we can fix the mess we were handed, and we can secure our economy and fix the gigantic wealth disparity.   

I'm not going to tell you how to specifically spend your money, you earned it and that's your right. But please, reflect on this for a minute.  

One of the first purchases I make after this is the new XBOX, through GameStop. Hell, I'll pre-order some shit too; i hate that concept, but for fuck sake its the least I can do for a company that was at the right time and place to influence a big change.

Wall street wants to call what we the people are doing ""unnatural."" They rage in the media about how awful we are. They are afraid of this ability we have to participate in the market. They fear that we can have a slice of the pie. They fear losing control of OUR financial destinies.

The little kids that have been bullied by the big boys are finally saying enough is enough. But that is not what this post is about. 

This post is an appreciation and a thank you for saving a part of my childhood. I remember when I was only a little autist of young age, my excitement to visit the mall had always been to rush towards the little Gamestop they had next to the foot locker and nike store over at the end of Hall B. Id drag my mom over and what I was entering wasnt a store full of fat hairy nerds in sweatpants but a fantasy land full of bright colors, every game imaginable for sale, gaming magazines with demo discs, console stations to play for hours on, anything that a simple autistic boy like me would be into. While Im older now and rarely get the same hype as I did back then, I still visit a Gamestop once in awhile and enjoy the nostalgia. I know many kids continue to experience the same thrill of entering a Gamestop with their parents (which are probably you guys now) today as I did back at a young age. I’m in tears knowing that we are saving an important part of our childhood and allowing the potential for Gamestop to evolve into a 21st century Cultural Spot where everyone that enjoys games and collecting can gather. 

These Hedgefunds that bully the weak and manipulate the markets to profit off of making companies go bankrupt and job losses should be ashamed of themselves. They are attempting to destroy a piece of history in our childhoods and those in the making, we are saving it. Stay strong 💎💎🚀🚀💪🏻💪🏻.

In 2008, VW had a short squeeze, when short sellers found out that only 6% of the float was available they scrambled to buy stock. VW soared to over €1000 per share. GME is 136% shorted, the squeeze will make history. It’s not about market manipulation, or hive mind thinking. It’s a chain reaction of events that will probably lead to regulation on shorts.

Edit: just to clear some common questions up. Yes the price can be anything we want. With 136% of stock shorted. That means more stock has to trade hands than there is available in a very very very small amount of time.

It’s not too late to get in as I say 136% of stock still HAS to trade hands at MARKET VALUE.


Edit#2: simple explanation of a short.

Firm owns GME stock (let’s say 100,000)

Hedge fund asks to borrow the stock to sell and agrees to pay interest the longer they borrow it. 

Hedge fund sells the 100,000 shares at market value (let’s say $10) and has that $1,000,000 suspended. 

If stock goes to $5 market value, they close their position by buying those 100,000 shares they borrowed at $5 ($500,000). The money for that is used by the $1,000,000 that was suspended, leaving $500,000 left. 

Hedge fund gives back the 100,000 shares to the owner and pockets the $500,000.

If the price were to go up though to say $15 then the hedge fund has their $1,000,000 suspension taken and they owe $500,000 on the difference.

This is why Melvin capital is facing bankruptcy, if it was true they bought shorts at $20. Then today opening at $244 dollars means they would have to pay $224 per share to close.


Edit#3:  you will know when the squeeze happens. Trust me you will know. The stock will rocket so high in a second. Trading will be suspended to allow people to set sell prices. Then rinse and repeat until all the shares owed are paid back. 

People who sold on the first spike are probably regretting it now. Diamond hands are going to make millions."|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212623.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['VW', 'VW', 'GME', 'I', 'HAS', 'ARKET', 'VALUE', 'GME']|['GME', 'HAS', 'GME']

So far, the following have worked out quite well (in order):

1. AMC  - Bought at around $5 (currently at around 17)
2. NOK - Also bought at around $5 (currently at around 7.5)
3. HIBB - Bought at 53 (currently at around 55.5)
4. BB - Bought at \~20 (Currently at 27)
5. NAKD: Bought at \~0.6 (currently at around 0.9)
6. EXPR: Bought at \~6 (currently at 10)

**Just bought 5000 SNDL stocks at 60 cents,** just based on a random unverified tweet that said it's among the top traded stocks today. Cheap stock, given the past trends, I don't think there's too much downside. Who knows if it gets pulled into the current trend and goes to double digits. Every dollar gained will mean $5K profit (I am not a seasoned investor, so just random logics)

Other longer term bets: Twtr, GM, Uber (currently losing), Salesforce (bought at 220), CPLP, Zoom, SCU

I do believe Nokia and BB can bounce back as businesses too, the rest I've invested mostly based on the chatter. AMC turned out to be a good decision. High hopes on NAKD and EXPR because I've bought a decent amount (by my own standards).

Any other stocks would you recommend, or any of the above you'd recommend exiting?

PS: Attached the screenshots a bit later when some of the stocks went down..hence, 22K gain reflected instead of 25K mentioned in the heading

I think the large players are starting to realize they need to take the retards on reddit seriously. I think they're attempting to astroturf the investing subreddits by giving awards to tickers they have a vested interest in. And at this moment, that's anything that isn't GME. They know that once the prevailing enthusiasm subsides they'll have the opportunity to close.

Stay wary and stay vigilant my comrades. This is a war of attrition.

I don't have direct evidence of this yet, but when I saw [https://downdetector.com/](https://downdetector.com/) today, it made me wonder if the Hedge Fund SOBs were funding DDoS attacks against the retail investment sites?

The economics of DDoS are pretty simple.  For $10,000 you can effectively bring nearly any site to its knees for a period of hours. So, if we assume that the retail investment sites like Robinhood, et. al. are down for most of the day, it could provide a window for the HF SOBs to cover their shorts because orders cannot be processed.

Imagine you're a HF SOB, you're looking at potentially billions in losses, what would a few hundred grand be to throw at keeping the retailer Robinhood crowd from placing trades long enough to bring GME down from the stratosphere? Get it down into the double-digits, save your hedge fund from a bailout or leverage from the big Wall Street bosses...

Again, no direct evidence yet, but the crowd I run with in my day job watches DDoS events pretty closely, and there is something phishy going on today."|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212623.csv|StockTicker|['S']|['S']|['I', 'K', 'I', 'I', 'S', 'S', 'HF', 'HF', 'SOB', 'GME', 'I', 'S']|['K', 'S', 'S', 'HF', 'HF', 'GME', 'S']

If you like the company hold, if not, sell.


I, like many of you, really like this stock.  I’m thrilled to see the future for GameStop and think Cohen is going to do amazing things.  I grew up in the generation that bought their games from GameStop so it’s a bit of nostalgia for me.  I want to see GME do big amazing things as a company.
I’m a Machiavellian so I immediately recognize manipulation when it’s happening around me.  As if it isn’t obvious, the money is opening doing everything they can to manipulate this stock downward.  It’s so obvious that my 93 year old grandma, who has fallen for the fake virus popups, can see its being manipulated.  

Recap for those of you who have missed it:

-Brokerages restricting trades to reduce volume and upward momentum
-Major talking heads trashing the company with DD that would fail a high school economics class
-those same talking heads accusing retail traders, most who are lower to middle class individuals, as somehow magically being capable of manipulating the market
-Major taking heads trying to bully retail traders by threatening SEC action and new regulations
-Major news organizations pushing potential lies about shorters closing their position with no obvious proof and serious lacking of volume
-Etc, etc

The questions you need to be asking yourself right now if you’re considering abandoning ship, is why are they fighting so hard?  The answer is they believe there is still room for GME to grow.  If this was it, if this is the top, if GME is so stupidly overvalued and we’re all about to become massive bag holders, they would just let it go., laughing their rich fat asses off as we plummet.  The market would fix itself in time and it wouldn’t be a big deal.  But there is room to go and that’s why they have to stop it in its tracks.  The market manipulators can only manipulate for so long.  Hold through and let’s see where this goes in a few days.

The solution is simple: if you like the company hold, if not abandon ship.  I like it, I’m holding my 900 shares."|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212623.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'DD', 'SEC', 'GME', 'GME', 'I']|['GME', 'DD', 'GME', 'GME']

Helllooooo Autists! It's me, ya boy. Back to talk some more about my favorite play right now, Microvision! **I have used this dip opportunity to more than double my previous position. Positions at bottom.**

As you all know from my [post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5hwiu/microvisions_macrovision_the_story_of_an/), Microvision is unbelievably undervalued in the marketplace right now. They have not only have **best in class LiDAR** for consumer and automotive (TWO verticals!), but they also have **best in class MEMS** displays (MSFT Hololens 2 and IVAS display, another vertical and **MSFT with a gov contract!**)!

# WHY I'M BACK AGAIN

Mainly for two reasons then we can jump in

1. **A POTENTIAL MAJOR CATALYST COMING TOMORROW**
2. The current formation of the chart looks **IDENTICAL TO THE LAST RUN FROM $3 TO $9+**

# Reason 1 - System Plus Consulting full Hololens 2 teardown and report available tomorrow

This is could be a **MAJOR** catalyst tomorrow when this [full report is released](https://www.systemplus.fr/reverse-costing-reports/microsoft-holographic-lens-from-hololens-2/). As we already know, thanks to the guys over at r/MVIS [(LINK TO THREAD)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/l61w3p/microsoft_holographic_lens_from_hololens_2_system/), the Hololens 2 **IS CONFIRMED TO USE MICROVISION MEMS DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY -** [SOURCE 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/gm1i2f/hololens_2_teardown_the_hunt_for_mvis/)(8 months ago) **+** [SOURCE 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/kxf2to/microvision_mems_mirror_in_the_hololens_2_the/)(12 days ago)**. This should finally lift the veil on Microvision and start getting more institutional and retail investors jumping in.**

&#x200B;

# Reason 2 - Crayon drawings look IDENTICAL to last 300% pop!

**Please forgive me for my awful crayon drawing, I had to use an old box because I ate all the new ones.....but check this out!**

[🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/ufmg7qbwfwd61.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=789b3ba55ccf39d855024c41039eabd31b5e2902)

Wow! What a chart! If you want a **more in-depth look,** [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck7IvrgglDw&feature=emb_title). But Look at all those circles! I've even color-coordinated them, to help our smooth brains. All I'll say is, compare the circles. See how each one looks like it is setting up to be identical?

1. Green circles - The first one is the first 3 days of upwards movement towards the boom, looking like we have the first few bars of that setup already
2. Red circles - the second one looks like it is going to finish today with a lot of indecisiveness in the direction and suppression from the resistance line right there. **This is playing out the same exact way as last time**. Last time we fucked with a heavy resistance then broke it and started the major run the next day.
3. Blue circles - Check out those increasing volume trends. If you can see the faded brown circles in the blue ones, check out the low ass volume coming in on those days followed by a **BOOM**
4. Black circles - RSI, you probably haven't read this far but looks like we can run up and out of the purple again

**IF HISTORY HOLDS TRUE, WE CAN SEE A 300+% PRICE MOVEMENT IN THE COMING DAYS.**

&#x200B;

# CONCLUSION

To wrap this up, let's take another quick look at the LiDAR competitors in the market...

**Luminar (LAZR)**

* **Stock Price - $39.39 (+$3.07, +8.25%)**
* **Market Cap - 12.731B**
* **Float - 177.19M**
* **Shares outstanding - 218.82M**

**Velodyne (VLDR)**

* **Stock Price - $26.23 (+$1.08, +4.22%)**
* **Market Cap - 4.433B**
* **Float - 55.52M**
* **Shares Outstanding - 168.71M**

**Wow!** Look at those market caps! Now let's see how Microvision compares...

**Microvision (MVIS)**

* **Stock Price - $7.79**
* **Market Cap - 1.02B**
* **Float - 145.69M**
* **Shares outstanding - 151.31M**

Just looking at the pure numbers and math of how this works out, **MVIS SHOULD SEE A PRICE TARGET OF AT LEAST 3X, IF NOT 4-6X!** And that is just looking at the **ONE AUTOMOTIVE LIDAR VERTICAL**. **If you add in their other verticals? Holy shit can this baby start to FLY**🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

**TL:DR - MICROVISION IS STILL EXTREMELY UNDERVALUED BY AT LEAST 3X, CHART LOOKS IDENTICAL TO LAST 300% RUN, THEY ARE BEST IN CLASS IN MULTIPLE VERTICALS**

**TL:CR - $MVIS**  🌙🌚🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

No one needs to block entrances to buildings or risk their bodies. These past few weeks of gains, donations, life-changing posts, camaraderie, and forcing the hand of a corrupt system needs to be the wave. When there's money involved, more people are willing to take risks because they see the benefits. Everyone isn't going to win, but more of us winning, means more of the everyday person winning. More hedge funds winning, especially after last year, means a recession. 

Keep retail alive. Keep small businesses open. Keep main street alive. Keep small towns flourishing.  Keep jobs on the market. Invest. Create. And prosper.

[I was one of the first to come out with a NOK DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l23du0/nokia_dd_one_way_trip_to_bonerville/) and I want you to listen closely. NOK is not the next GME. NOK is not the next TSLA. NOK is NOK. I gave a conservative PT of $10 EOY and I still stand by it, not what you gaylords translated to $10 EOW or some shit. Keep in mind, that’s still over a 100% gain, so tendies are there.

Looking at my previous DD, here’s how you should REALISTICALLY, and qualitatively, value $NOK:

&#x200B;

>5G infrastructure giants… with little Chinese competition thanks to Daddy Trump (RIP) banning Huawei, Nokia is in an oligopoly when it comes to 5G infrastructure.

* It takes a long time to build infrastructure, infrastructure that won’t pay out until later

&#x200B;

>Which means…. they are the world’s 3rd largest telecoms equipment manufacturer

* 3rd largest, but still in a fiercely competitive landscape

&#x200B;

>Nokia does a lot of patent licensing, meaning steady cash flow

* Nothing to say on this point

&#x200B;

>Beyond telecommunications, they also work in imaging, sensing, Internet of Things, all the buzzwords

* These are all growing industries that show a lot of potential

&#x200B;

>Recently new management

* They will be doing some cost cutting and strategic positioning. Cost cutting is immediate but strategy takes a while to materialize.

&#x200B;

>Government contract are also a sticky biz, and this is the coolest of them all:  
>  
>\- Motherfuckers signed with NASA a $14M contract to install 4G on the moon. The company is going to the atmosphere, boys

* Let’s talk about gov’t contracts. NOK has a lot of them globally, they are usually paid out in installments They’re sticky business that provides consistency over the long term.

&#x200B;

To address other concerns that have come up since:

* “tHe fLoAt iS tOo BiG tO pUmP” Yeah no shit dude. WSB has such little influence to actually pump anything, plus if you want to dump it, it becomes illegal.
* **GME and BB Gang**, we are not trying to divide you. We are seeing opportunity elsewhere. Shut the fuck up and I’m rooting for you.
* **NOK Gang**, also shut the fuck up. Stop spamming and shit, actually present good arguments as to why NOK.
* Other DDs have been great and have done supplement research/brought up other points. Props to them.
* I jacked off before posting this and it was red. Mental note to see a doctor later.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Still a BULL but  you retards need to ground your expectation, now everyone hates NOK because it didn’t throw up two days of 15% returns in a row like you shills said. Very bullish on NOK, but it is a LONG TERM play. I’M NOT FUCKING SELLING. Suck my willy.

They fear that their model, their traditionalist way of thinking, their place in society will become irrelevant. 

u/benaffleks summed it up beautifully: “This is a big moment. A tug of war between tradition and the future.”

Think about it. Why aren’t YOU a hedge fund manager? What makes Gabe Plotkin any more deserving to be a hedge fund manager than YOU?

He was born into the wealthy family, he was invited to the grown-up table in his early 20s, he placed a few massive bets, got mega lucky on one, made a few billion, and now he’s made to look like a genius. 

Yet, the thousands and millions of WSB retail investors have shown that investing doesn’t belong in the hands of a few. Instead of these mega companies and mega hedge funds, you have can millions of more efficient, more empowered smaller companies and investors who are deploying their capital (however small) in a manner that befits their worldview, not the worldview of a select few.

This is happening to just one stock. And look at its effect. We are upending traditionalist thinking. We are making front-page news. This GME bull run isn’t incredible for the gains over the past week as it is for how we are literally redefining how things currently work into how they should work in the future. 

The implications of this are mind blowing.

Education, climate change, healthcare, environment, personal finance, pensions.

These are the most important issues confronting us. But today, the decisions affecting these areas are made by a few elite. Can you imagine the kind of strides we could make in these sectors if we were to democratize decision-making? The kind of world we could live in? 

Chamath’s philosophy is to mobilize his capital to get us closer and closer to that. That’s why he’s dropping $10 mil on this experiment.

EDIT: The $10 million is referring to his Twitter reply, not the 115 February call options he bought! (Which was also poated on Twitter). He essentially said he would fund 100  WSBers with $100k EACH to go be a mini hedge fund managers with Chamath invested as a LP."|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212631.csv|StockTicker|['WSB']|[]|['A', 'YOU', 'YOU', 'WSB', 'GME', 'EACH', 'LP']|['GME']

As you all well know, Michael Burry is a retarded genius with dead eyes who basically prints money. After daddy Burry gave us GameStop when he initiated a very large position in early 2020, he also gave us another brilliant undercover idea in Q3 2020: CVS. 

Take a look at Scion Asset Managements 13F disclosure showing daddy Burry degenerately buying CVS Call Options. The fact Burry is holding shit tons of calls in addition to shares indicates a high level of conviction to me. 

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761920019679/xslForm13F\_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml

Similarly to Gamestop, CVS is a shitty looking chain of seedy feeling stores, where you go in to pick up your Chlamydia medication and leave sad. It is however undervalued!!!

So what does Burry know? The general outlook for healthcare spending is positive and on an accelerating curve, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating US healthcare spending reached nearly $3.5T in 2017, a dollar increase of 4.6% from 2016 levels. CMS is projecting healthcare spending to continue to grow at an even faster pace over the next decade, drive by expanding insurance coverage, an aging population, and increasing prescription drug costs. Specifically, CMS is expecting an annual growth per year of 5.5% between 2017 and 2026, with HC spending projected to reach 19.7% of GDP in 2026. 

The CVS acquisition of Aetna closed in November 2018, with the goal of creating an integrated healthcare platform to better position CVS from competitive threats. The concept is unproven and will take time to develop. From a cost perspective, management sees cost savings totaling at least $750m by 2020, with $350m coming in 2019. 

Let’s look at the money. Most of you morons prefer companies that lose money yet have fancypants PowerPoint presentations, so please avert your eyes looking at a cashflow positive balance sheet:

CVS basically does $6 billion in net income a year, and has a market cap of $97 billion, so it trades a Price/Ebitda of about 15 and an Enterprise Value/Ebitda of about 10 -- which in this market is FUCKING CHEAP. CVS is massively accelerating its rollout of minute clinics, and will continue to absorb all the fallout from private doctors and hospitals closing in the wake of Covid19. 

This is a list of over 500 rural hospitals that are facing closure due to Covid. CVS will absorb a lot of the demand for primary care that hospitals meet – remember most Americans are retarded and treat hospitals like primary care doctors.

Additionally, the complete and total death of most retail stores, and the decimation of mom & pop stores, will only be a tailwind to CVS. This is sad but true. 

Lastly, the implied volatility on CVS options is CHEAP!! Basically, this is not a stock that generally makes sharp moves, nor does the market expect it to – meaning that you can buy options very very cheap. And IF the market or WSB figures out that daddy Burry wants us to buy this too – expect these options to EXPlODE!!!

In addition to being nearly entirely out of food, I had a super long day of classes/projects  (who are we kidding I was refreshing Robinhood from 9:30 - 4:00) and I only ate twice today. This guy swoops in and buys me like $20+ worth of Taco Bell which is a TON of food. I asked for a box combo and he sent me that plus a ton of food I didn't even ask for. I was dreading doing legs tomorrow morning on an empty stomach but now I'm chock full of carbs, grade E beef and Baja Blast and I'm going to crush my deadlift PR thanks to this guy. All that money sitting in hedge funds is now going out to charities and college randos like me instead of being used to short stocks and make life worse for people and I love it. I could lose everything tomorrow and I wouldn't even blink. The experience alone has been worth everything I've put into GME.

TL;DR:  u/Ok-Championship5727 is the real wsbgod, Melvin's tendies are better off in our pockets (we know how to spend them better). This is flaired as gain because I gained Taco Bell

I just wanted to post some information about Gamestop next to additional information.

Right now as of 09:36 CET, Gamestop ist up 109% in German trading. The price usually corresponds to future prices and aligns with US pre-market trading once available.

Interesting: short sellers of Varta AG, German battery manufacturer who was in the past heavily shorted, reduced their positions strongly. For example Melvin Capital reduced its position by 15%, Maplelane Capital reduced its position by around 16%. These are relative values. Current shorted stock is ca. 8% shares outstanding. Varta shares rose ca. 25% in the past 5 trading days.

This means that shorts fear similar situations as is the case with Gamestop for their other positions. Keep that in mind when hunting for other short squeezes. The shorts are cautious now.

Keep at it, but be careful

Edit 1: This is no intent to boost Varta. I would not do it personally, since as stated, shorts have retreated and numbers of shares shorted is nowhere near GME.

My position in GME: no position right now. I sold my shares after German market open and am waiting for US market open to look at initial trading.

Update 1: Now that US pre-market trading has opened, share price in Germany has aligned. This does not mean, there has to be a bad performance on NYSE today. The intent of looking at German prices early was also to see if Elon's tweet drew additional buyers, which could be argued."|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212632.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'CET', 'US', 'AG', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'US', 'US', 'NYSE']|['AG', 'GME']

For all you know, they reversed it and are riding the wave now.

&#x200B;

This ""math"" that $12 up on GME is $1b down to Melvin is complete, total, and utter bullshit. While it *could* be true, it's also just as probable it's not true. The amount you don't know about their books would probably astound you. They also can buy OTC options that you would *never* know about - meaning options that are entirely bespoke (over the counter), made just for them by their lovely PB and only they and their PB are aware they even exist. A bit unlikely, but not impossible.

&#x200B;

With that said, hope they get nuked tomorrow and learn a valuable lesson in managing your downside tail risk. Never short a stock without buying a way OTM call! If that pair has a bad risk/reward profile, move on.

&#x200B;

Source: used to work in a managed account platform for hedge funds as a market risk analyst focusing on equity derivatives where even we only knew about trades on a T+1 basis (i.e. 1 day delayed). Not even Melvin's investors would know their live positions unless it's Steve himself.

[Blackrock increases positions in GME](https://sec.report/Document/0000834237-21-001340/)

Here's some observations for us autists on this. This is not as *bullish* as it seems. Why?

When Passive funds get into a stock - there's evidence that they *usually* allow a significant portion of their position to be borrowed against (see below). By doing this, they extract returns from capital appreciation & interest from the Shorts. **For GME longs, this is bad in the sense that there is an increased amount of shares available to short.** 

In my opinion, a big passive fund like Blackrock could care less about returns on 1 singular stock, so this brings up the question. **Why did Blackrock increase their positions?** 

Probably will get an answer like 'market cap increase led to increased size of tracked index, so we got in'. But this is some cookie cutter shit. What if they're working with the Shorts to increase borrowed supply? Funny how this happened in tandem with Melvin's capital infusion. 

If someone less retarded than me were able to connect the dots, this looks like *fraud-ey* to me. Someone with more vested into GME should definitely look into this. This type of activity looks like the beginning of a wider onslaught by the Shorts ahead of this Friday's options expiry

For less autistic retards - index funds allowing their shares to borrowed, is in a weird way how they 'sell' their voting rights. **This actually happened to GME in the recent board meeting & it looks like the Shorts were trying to prevent Ryan Cohen & Co. from taking too many of the Board seats**:

[See here for full post](https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2021/01/19/the-index-fund-dilemma-an-empirical-study-of-the-lending-voting-tradeoff/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+cls-blue-sky-blog+%28CLS+Blue+Sky+Blog%29)

>We examine funds’ incentives through an empirical study of the lending-voting tradeoff after the Securities and Exchange Commission’s 2019 guidance on funds’ fiduciary duties. The guidance departed from prior practice by encouraging funds to take into account “opportunity costs” of share lending when making their voting decisions. In the past, SEC staff guidance required that funds recall shares they loaned when material items were on the ballot to ensure that voting would occur. ...  
>  
>More share lending means less voting – regardless of whether the shares are borrowed in the end. Because shares can be borrowed at-will from the lending agent or broker, and then voted by the ultimate holder as of the record date, shares put on loan do not carry voting instructions. Hence, shares made available for loan but not borrowed are not voted – making share lending a significant contributor to non-voting. By one estimate, in 2010 alone, 60 billion shares went unvoted, with 15 billion shares on loan.  
>  
>**With no fiduciary constraint on share lending, corporate elections can have surprising results. Most notably, in June of 2020, a proxy fight at GameStop surprised the investor and corporate community when activists with only 7.3 percent of shares won board seats despite opposition from large institutional investors that collectively owned around 40 percent of shares. This was possible because nearly 40 percent of GameStop shares (nearly all the shares held by institutions) were on loan, most of which were presumably borrowed by short sellers and other investors with goals contrary to the funds and similar long-term investors.**

Every action one takes in a financial market potentially manipulates prices.  Thus references to ""manipulation"" in this context means specifically actions that violate SEC regulations.  Despite all the scare tactics and vague claims, I have yet to see anyone actually mention a specific potential violation.

Please school us.  Rocket rocket rocket, rainbow hedgehog, chicken tenders.  (Sorry, not from around here.)

[Edit: You guys really are retards and mostly missed my point.  Everyone is here defending the actions of WSB by saying ""what others do is 10x worse"" or ""they deserve it"" or ""they can't go after all of us"" or ""we like gamestop, that's all there is to it.""  It is legal to buy a stock *even if you don't buy it based on the fundamentals underlying company.*  You could think GME is trash and still buy just because the short interest is high.  That's not illegal.  It's not illegal to try and convince others to buy it for that reason.  Markets are complicated and they can't be ""morally"" regulated like this.  (That goes for all the retards suggesting that short selling should be banned too.)

When people say ""this isn't financial advice,"" that legal disclaimer is to note that they are not a ""financial advisor"" which is a very specific role, wherein the advisor has to act in the fiduciary interest of their client.  It is perfectly fine to give, receive, and act on financial advice and public information.  It would be illegal manipulation to knowingly lie about GameStop in order to induce others to purchase the stock.  Even then, *intent* is essential, and it's not simply a matter of being wrong or retarded.]"|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212634.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['SEC', 'I', 'WSB', 'GME']|['GME']

Many of us retards have been buying high short interest stonks hand over fist (myself included...)

Be aware that there is about a **two week lag** in the date reported and the date the information is sent. A lot of sites are **still reporting numbers 12/31**.

The next settlement date recorded is **1/15**, the next release date is **tomorrow at the close.** This will reveal how many of you flaccid dickheads have paper hands.

Here is the full release schedule from FINRA: [https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest)

From the NASDAQ site:

>FINRA member firms are required to report their short positions as of settlement on (1) the 15th of each month, or the preceding business day if the 15th is not a business day, and (2) as of settlement on the last business day of the month.\* The reports must be filed by the second business day after the reporting settlement date. FINRA compiles the short interest data and provides it for publication on the 8th business day after the reporting settlement date.

&#x200B;

Melvin Capital claims to have closed out its short position on Tuesday afternoon which most of you probably have already read. I'm not going to even link that article. DON'T BE FOOLED BY THEM. No hedge fund is going to come out and announce not only to their investors but the ENTIRE PUBLIC that they have been retarded with the money entrusted to them unless there was an incentive. Remember: these funds make money not only by outperforming benchmarks but also on management fees on the assets they manage, juicy 2% fees. Why on earth would they spook not only their current investors but potential investors as well? They would see massive withdrawals if that was the case. 

For proof:

[GME 2 day chart 01\/25 & 01\/26 \(Operating on Asia time so AM is PM\)](https://preview.redd.it/nf4h7y34qvd61.png?width=1398&format=png&auto=webp&s=917cfa8fe653dab622de0f3f4012a34031c8bb50)

(https://imgur.com/gallery/L9EO2CN)

Notice how the highest volume of shares clustered around 12noon to closing at 4pm? Melvin conveniently selected the time period with the highest volume to disguise the fact that they are still perma-bear short GME. For a fund with Melvin's position, we would at least have seen a hulk green dildo at least somewhere in the day's trading session where those shorts were covered. What did we see instead? A slow steady grind upwards even with 5m shares traded at the day's peak. The spike only occurred after-hours on significantly lower volume at 1.3m shares. 

Think about it, Melvin was short GME when it was at least below 30 and if all of that 1.3m volume was from them, that would've been a $39m initial position for a hedge fund with $13.5 billion in assets back in early Jan or 0.289% of the entire fund which is too small to consider as a trade for their size. Even at the covered value of \~$230, that would have amounted to just 2.2% of their entire portfolio. A 0.289% or even at best, 2.2% trade driving a significant portion of their [30% year to date losses?](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/steve-cohen-ken-griffin-invest-3-billion-gamestop-short-seller-2021-1-1030003305) I don't think so. Financial news outlets once again serving as a mouth piece for billion dollar hedge funds - see what they do, not what they say.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** Don't trust every piece of financial news you read or watch, do your research first. Bill Ackman cried out Armageddon is coming on national TV at the bottom of the 2020 crash and went long immediately afterwards. This is no different. The GME war is still on. DO NOT SELL. 💎 ✋

WSB has loved its $GME calls and shares since November/ December. Many of us are gamers, so when we heard our spot was having a hard time, we bought some shares to show our support. This had nothing to do with you -- many of us didn't even know you existed (not Gabe at least, some folks knew about Andrew). We were happy that $GME picked up a little (to $20 then $30). 

And then you guys had to go and short $GME. We didn't make that decision for you. You decided to tweet (Andrew, looking at you here) that $GME was worth only $20. We decided you're wrong. We don't want to sell at that price. We didn't even want to sell at $40. Many people still don't want to sell at $250.

Recently, Andrew released a video and Gabe called to CNBC. Both of you claim you got out/ closed your positions. That's nice -- we don't believe you, but that's nice. One of our many sources report there are still 44.79 of the 47.93 million shares on loan, and only 1.9 days left to pay it back. ([GameStop Corp., NYSE:GME | Short Interest | Flagged Changes | Largest Shorts | Cost To Borrow - ORTEX](https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts)). This doesn't square with your statements. 

So don't take it personally. Yes, it sucks to lose billions when many wsb folks are cheering their unexpected gains -- gains that will help them pay off their student loans, buy their first house or car, help their aging and ailing relatives put food on the table, or cover healthcare costs incurred during the pandemic. It's not about you. It's just that we like the stock.

We were discounted and disrespected without anyone actually reading our DD. Was it our fault institutional money shorted over 100% of the stock? Hell no. But we were there with baskets ready to catch all the falling tendies from the sky when the institutional thesis fell apart? Hell yes. Who wouldn't?

These are my take away lessons from recent events:

1. Place bets on what you can afford to lose. Know this number before doing anything.
2. Watching the ticker throughout the day has no value. If you know what you've bought, be confident in your DD.
3. Beware of your sources of information; recognize their biases.
4. Don't make decisions based on price gyrations.
5. If the psychological pressure of a position is too much, it is OK to sell. There are always new plays that will be there in the future. Greed will always be present and money will be made.
6. Money managers on tv and on websites aren't there to help you. They are pushing always pushing an agenda. These agendas can be benign or malignant. That is up to you to figure out.
7. The narrative can be more important than the truth. We learned this the hard way. We were painted with a broad brush, characterized unfairly and wholly blamed without any evidence. This is important to recognize especially if manipulators need a narrative out there to help their cause.

This is my list so far.

Like to hear some thoughts.

Positions: none to disclose.

Specifically the prisoner's dilemma.


The prisoners dilemma was a game crafted by John Nash (see A Beautiful Mind). The game goes like this:


Two prisoners who we will call Aaron and Bob are picked up and brought into separate interrogation rooms. They are told their friend is ratting them out. They know the cops don't have enough to get a good hearing without one or both of them confessing. The cops say that if they rat on the other guy they will get reduced sentences. The cops offer to take 2 years off the sentence of anyone that talks.


The prisoners do not know if the other guy is talking. This leads to 4 possibilities: both dont talk; Aaron talks and Bob doesnt; Bob talks and Aaron doesnt; or, they both talk.  If neither talks, the cops can only put them away for 5 years each since they dont have enough hard evidence for the crimes. If only one talks, the person that talks wont have enough evidence against him so he will get 5 years minus 2 for talking. The other person will get 10 years. If they both talk, they will both get 10 years minus 2 for talking. In chart form it looks like this:


/                   |  A Talks |  A doesnt |


| B talks.   |  8 , 8.       |  10 , 3


| B doesn't|  3 , 10.      |  5 , 5


The interesting part about the game is that no matter what your best option is always to talk. It always takes 2 years off your sentence. However, the cumulative best outcome (the lowest jail time) is for both parties to act against their self interest and not talk and to hope your opponent does the same.


This theory flew in the face of Adam Smiths notion of unrestrained self interest. It won Nash the Nobel prize and is the reason cartels like OPEC are successful.


What does this have to do with GME? Holders of GME are in the same boat. Their own self interest says they should sell now and get out with their winnings. If they dont sell and the other guys do, they are fucked. But if everyone holds the line and acts against their self interest, they can have the best result.

I get that they have been at the center of this and we all want to stick it to them. However, it doesn’t matter if they did or not. All that matters is where the overall short interest is at. According to another user who found SI data on GameStop this morning. It’s still well over 100%.

This can go A LOT further if the cards fall the right way. There has never been anything like this. I’m certain there will be books written about this and more than likely some additional regulations around short interest as well. 

Stick to the data. Fuck what CNBC says and any other hedge fund. They’re scared. This is an opportunity of a life time and you should recognize it as such and capitalize on it to the best of your abilities. Because chances are we won’t see anything quite like this again.

I am the $ALLY guy.

There is so much going on right now. The market is broken. And guess who broke it? WSB. Love it. But there is more to this sequence of events than meets the eye.

Yes, everyone is up big on $GME. Yes, 20 year old millionaires are being made overnight. Yes, the market has been shaken up and deep-pocket investors are scared. All of this is great, but there is something bigger going on here, whether you know it or not.

Since the inception of the NYSE: market makers, insiders, and institutions have used the market as a medium to siphon funds from retail investors.

All of us are retail investors; we are fighting an uphill battle. Market makers/insiders/institutions exploit news releases in order to manipulate retail sentiment. By doing so, the market makers are able to orchestrate the price moment of the market, and even individual stocks.

The market makers do this by operating what is known as the ""accumulation phase"" and the ""distribution phase"".

During the accumulation phase, market makers influence bearish sentiment. As the price of the market or an individual stock decreases, the market makers buy MASSIVE amounts of shares. Once the market makers accumulate a predetermined amount of shares, the market makers will then influence bullish sentiment. As the price of the market increases significantly, the market makers will set a price target. Once the price target is met, the market makers will begin the distribution phase. In the distribution phase, market makers offload nearly all of the shares they have accumulated. Guess who buys all these shares while bullish sentiment is strong? Retail investors. Once the market makers have sold a sufficient amount of the shares they accumulated, they will then influence bearish sentiment and prepare for the accumulation phase. Guess who incurs heavy losses while the deep-pockets make money? Retail investors.

This is BS. How is this justified? Because retail investors never did anything about it. We never stood up for ourselves. Whether you know it or not, that is exactly what we are doing r*ight now.* We are standing up and saying ""Fuck you"".

Sure, the market makers probably aren't concerned with $GME, but who fucking cares. What is happening right now is symbolic of the power that retail investors have. It's more than power, we are fucking sick of institutions, deep-pockets, and market makers exploiting retail investors for money! FUCK THAT.

It is time. Time to deviate from the norm. Time to shake up the market. Time to scare the shit out of some very powerful people. Most importantly, it is time to change the world.

WSB is not about pump-and-dump schemes. Sure, we all bought into $GME and it is up nearly 8000% on the year, but this is still *not* a pump-and-dump. My interpretation of justice is to receive what we are owed. Let me fucking tell you, **this is exactly what we are owed**.

So, why stop at $GME? We pissed a lot of people off, and the same people we pissed off are the people exploiting our ""naivety"" for money. We aren't naive at all, we just aren't billionaires! This movement should not and will not stop with $GME. It's time to stand for something, and we will *not* stop until our ambitions are realized. Let's say the SEC comes knocking. So fucking what. What admirable person has ever achieved anything without a tremendous force actively oppressing them? As foolish as this may sound, doing **exactly** what we are doing **right** **now** may be the most important thing we ever do in our lives.

There is no reason to stop. We must keep going, we must be heard. After $GME, we *have* to move on to something else. I, personally, would willingly accept any punitive measures taken against myself if it meant pissing off some powerful people and changing the world.

We must produce inordinate buying pressure on $GME until the media hype dies. Once that happens, we move on and do it again. Make the deep-pockets conform to us. Never again will we conform to them.

Wishing everyone in this sub the best. Whether this post is hated or loved, just know that we are making history here boys and girls. Time to sack up and own it. Consequences? Fuck em'.

THESE ARE FUDDERS TRYING TO GET IN CHEAPER OR EXIT POSITIONS. THE HYPE IS REAL**

Nokia is now a market leader in networking and enterprise level technology, essentially providing infrastructure for all types of networks. They also manufacture telecommunications equipment and engage in licensing. The most exciting opportunity in their current business model is 5G, which could be the main catalyst for this seemingly boring stock to finally break through resistance and become a valuable asset in portfolios. I'll give some key updates and price targets below. 


Partnerships and beneficiary of 5G rollouts


For starters, it's been a common thesis that 5G will be the greatest investing opportunity of the decade, yet Nokia remains in a flat/downward pattern on the chart. They've recently earned several contracts that will give them a stronger moat in the 5G domain as well as steady revenues and growth opportunities. Recent contracts come from a very diverse group of partners, including: 

-A 5 year deal with T-Mobile, in which T-Mobile will power it's 2.5GHz mid-band spectrum using Nokia's AirScale Radio platform. In addition, Nokia will facilitate T-Mobile to upgrade it's mid-band LTE network to a 5G network. 

-Secured a government contract via the National Cybersecurity Center for Excellence. Nokia was selected as the tech provider and collaborator for the 5G Cybersecurity Project. The federal agency plans to utilize Nokia's technology for the transition to 5G from 4G. The project intends to identify 5G use cases to highlight the efficacy of the components of 5G architecture against security threats as part of a government initiative to beef up it's cyber security and anti-spying tools.

-Partnership with Google Cloud in which the 2 firms will work in unison on businesses' digital transformation at the network edge through both 5G connectivity and cloud-native applications and capabilities. The partnership's purpose is to develop solutions for communication service providers to modernize network infrastructure and ensure smooth transitions to cloud-native 5G-core. This will likely build an ecosystem of services that deployable anywhere, from network edge, to public clouds, private clouds, and carrier networks. 

-Nokia has also recently announced partnerships with M1 for 5G solutions in Singarpore, as well as TeleZ to deploy key infrastructure solutions for TeleZ subsribers in Sweden, Lativa, Lithuania, and Estonia. They were also awarded a contract by NASA for $14.1 million to build 4G infrastructure on the moon. 


Nokia has more than 220 large enterprise customers across industries worldwide, of which at least 30 have deployed 5G. They were also in a geopolitical battle in which the U.S. expressed interest in owning a piece of the company, and in response Finland built it's stake in Nokia via Solidium Oy, the state's equity-asset manager, to 1 billion euros($1.2b usd). Nokia also intends to repurchase 500 million shares in the coming months, so demand for the stock is picking up on all levels. 


In addition to infrastructure, licensing is a huge part of Nokia's business model that will benefit from 5G. The ""Nokia Technologies"" Arm handles patent licensing, technology licensing, and brand licensing. This includes an industry-leading patent portfolio including ~20,000 patent families including ~3500 5G standard essential patent families. 


So why is a company with so many valuable assets and recently announced deals/partnerships still trading flat and so seemingly undervalued? The short answer is the former CEO made several bad choices which gave Nokia's competitors an upper hand on the current 5G landscape and put NOK share price in a long term downtrend which has gave it a reputation as a boring stock with an ugly chart. However, with new CEO Pekka Lundmark's expertise in driving returns to shareholders, as well as the scrutiny and subsequent bans of Huawei opening the door for competition, Nokia now has a much needed breath of life and a chance to gain market share to become the biggest beneficiary of the 5G revolution. The new CEO is determined to get Nokia to the top and pull in solid returns to shareholders, as evidenced by the slew of recent contracts/partnerships along with his plans for spending aggressively on R&D, as well as developing a leaner business model by cutting unnecessary expenses and unprofitable endeavors. 


Nokia is primed for growth as they plan into several emerging, high growth markets including 5G, IoT, Edge computing, Network Encryption, Cloud Radio Access, Software Defined Infrastructure(SDI), Cloud Managed LAN, Optical Communications and Networking, as well as established high growth markets such as Smart Wearables, Defense/Security, and LTE. 



Despite the slew of positive news surrounding Nokia and their partnerships/contracts, the stock is still very undervalued, even at today's price surge. 

That may soon change, as the stock's chart is beginning to signal incoming volatility. The implied volatility(IV) and volume for NOK call options are indicating big moves in the coming months. Open interest is on the rise as well. 




NOK is trading at a Price/Book ratio of 1.3x, compared to it's peers average of 4.0x and the sector average 2.2x 

NOK is also undervalued in terms of Price/LTM sales. It has a ratio of 0.9x, it's peers trade at an average of 3.9x, and the sector average of 1.8x

To establish the Fair Value Estimate, we'll use 2 models taking input from previous NOK financials, as well as data from competitors. (Competitors include: CSCO, ERIC, MSI, MSFT, and AAPL.

P/E Multiples: $14.94 target 

Earnings Power Value: $15.64 target 

The average for the 2 models imply a Fair Value Estimate of $15.29 




These estimates are based on historical data, therefore are fair values for the current price and past performance, not taking into account the market share and recurring revenue recently secured. I believe over the 3 months ad beyond the fair value will be much higher as earnings begin to reflect the value and growth from 5G contracts and recurring revenues. 


Even currently, those estimates are a bit low as Nokia's closest competitor, Ericsson, has a market cap that is nearly 70% higher than Nokia, despite the two having very similar financials and even trailing Nokia in several key metrics. 



At NOK's current share price of, it remains undervalued as ERIC is only ahead of NOK in 2 key categories, EBITDA and Profit Margin, and ERIC is only outperforming NOK by a slim margin in these categories. I believe NOK should be valued much higher, than ERIC since they are gaining contracts MUCH faster than ERIC and also Huawei, which would imply a share price of $7.11 before any buybacks place shares into the treasury, which would increase the price even further. 


Nokias Fair value is over $25

$GM is going all ELECTRIC BABY, 30 new EVS by 2023. They also own Cruise Automation which recently got a $2bn investment from Honda and Microsoft. Don't forget Buffet's recent $1.7bn investment that has grown significantly.

Send it boys, I need me a megamansion.

Ben Carlson and Michael Batnick discussed the GME trades at length, and Ben seems pretty sure that something actionable by the SEC has taken place. The podcast is below.

[https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/its-very-different-this-time/id1310192007?i=1000506734250](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/its-very-different-this-time/id1310192007?i=1000506734250)

""Downtown Josh Brown"" says, ""If you're a young person posting on these message boards, and you're new to trading, you realize that market manipulation is illegal, and if there are records of you manipulating this stuff, the Tendie Man is not coming, the Feds are coming. And it's not going to be fun, even if you're 25 years old.""

Actual question: Masayoshi Son was clearly manipulating the market last year with his monster options moves. How would a group of traders sharing ""memes"" but not actually working together ever be worse than what Softbank was doing?

&#x200B;

today i want to introduce you to Nokia #NOK. 🚀

The year is 1865 in Finland – NOK was founded. Our beloved God Elon didnt even exist as a sperm back then; nor did your boomer grandpa. NOK took vegetables and made paper out of it. Then they decided to make phones and computers. 

In 2014 NOK sold their phone business to Microsoft for billions. Microsoft sold it to HMD global. NOK still receives royalties for their name. So NOK is not a phone company anymore (do not confuse the 2 when researching). 

Today, NOK is far more advanced than making paper from paprika or selling undestructable phones. By taking over a joint-venture from Siemens in 2013, Alcatel-Lucent in 2015 and continuous work, aquisitions and research, they now pose as a major player in hardware and software for critical communication technology. More about this later.

In August last year (2020), NOK hired one of their key phone infrastructure employees back. He was there from 1990 – 2000. And now he is back as CE fucking O. 🚀

In between 2000-2020 he did some random shenanigan CEO stuff. His name is Pekka (#CoC) Lundmark. NOK have 2 other new executives, very capable.

5G - The economic future outlook is looking very juicy compared to NOK’s share price: 

NOK has a market share of 22%. Sure, Ericsson has 26, Huawei has 28.5%. But Huawei is kicked out of Europe, North America, and now many more.The list of countries banning Huawei is growing fast. Who is happy to take over, even in asia? (look at Singapore, partly Thailand f.e.) NOK, Samsung, Ericsson. NOK will have a pie of it. 🚀

[https://www.channele2e.com/business/enterprise/huawei-banned-in-which-countries/](https://www.channele2e.com/business/enterprise/huawei-banned-in-which-countries/)

EV with autonomous driving will need 5G to be connected perfectly. Also autonomous traffic such as drones will rely on this heavily. Guess who produces infrastructure for this, and offers safe communication infrastructure solutions already tested? NOK. 🚀

The finnish, norwegian and swedish governments already bought into NOK. 5G with secure critical infrastructure is a big deal.  

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-08/finland-is-building-its-nokia-stake-in-response-to-u-s-interest-ketqcpo7](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-08/finland-is-building-its-nokia-stake-in-response-to-u-s-interest-ketqcpo7)

What else? NOK is involved in cyber-security slightly similar to #BB BlackBerry. 

Nokia Smart Grid for securing power stations; Network security in general; IOT security and Railway infrastructure security.

5G will be developed faster than you think. According to Ericssons 2020 mobility report, 40% of all mobile internet subs will be 5G – 3.5 billion users in 2026. You might think thats 6 years still, but remember that its 40% of all mobile subs, and where are 3.5bn of subs? Except EU and NA – think China, India, South america, africa, south east asia. Massive numbers.

With one deal, NOK managed to secure 2.2bn$ in 2018.

Research & Development: 

NOK is the flagship for 6G research in the EU. 

[https://www.rcrwireless.com/20201207/5g/nokia-lead-european-commission-6g-research-initiative](https://www.rcrwireless.com/20201207/5g/nokia-lead-european-commission-6g-research-initiative)

NOK is working with NASA to put 4G and 5G on the fucking MOON. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

[https://www.satellitetoday.com/telecom/2021/01/04/bringing-lte-to-the-moon-nokia-exec-talks-nasa-tipping-point-contract/](https://www.satellitetoday.com/telecom/2021/01/04/bringing-lte-to-the-moon-nokia-exec-talks-nasa-tipping-point-contract/)

I didnt look to far in research and development; NOK has claimed some 3000 patents for 5G, but Huawei is the leader right now. What seems interesting though is that NOK is ahead in confirmed patents. 

https://preview.redd.it/0m0suzawnwd61.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&s=635e3eeb409ada0404f6caae272b77066224c523

&#x200B;

The discussion about the patent leaders are diffuse. TwoBirds said that Ericsson was leading, with Huawei questioned as to if their numbers were legit. Qualcomm is also a major player. 

**My point though is that NOK’s stock is still flat,** while Qualcomm and the others significantly gained. (Except Huawei, political risk)

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

NOK is worth a buy IMO. Traffic of tomorrow will rely heavily on secure 5G infrastructure. NOK’s basic revenue is solid, cash flow positive. They will pay dividends, and are a big competitor in a growing sector. They will need their time though, they wont skyrocket next month. 

This is not a YOLO play. As u/ST_McD pointed out, NOK is not the next GME. I see good upside on this stock though, around 100% until next year. 

For 2 other good DD's on this, check u/ST_McD and u/zepherance. Special thanks to u/zepherance, I used some info from ur DD. 

&#x200B;

Position: long 4000 @ 3.85 Eur. Looking to get calls soon - 8c Jan 22. 

This is not financial advise, I'm not a bot and this is not distortion of GME - im holding. 

&#x200B;

TL;CR: NOK go boom. NOK build Internet for Moon with NASA.

Guys, GME has shown what power this community has. I have been following this subreddit for years, and have made decent profits with you guys. Finally its time to pay back the community for those profits, great laughs and memes. 

Let's use our power, bring GME to the moon, force the squeeze and then go into the next stock. CNBC calls this a 'crisis', they call us 'foreign powers' who manipulate markets. But we are ROBIN HOODS, we take back the power and the profits to the every day autist. WE ARE GOING TO THE MOON. 

Lord Elon is on our side, DDTG is on our side, Michael Burry is on our side and the SEC will be too.

THE BIG SQUEEZE IS COMING, RIDE IT TO THE MOON.

The short squeeze continues to crush short sellers while EVs & Hydrogen are on the move. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw all 3 major indexes finish the day down, with both the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/PspccJG) and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/rwB8b2z) losing .07% while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/qg7hSBb) dropped by .15% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/NYVtHtF) remained pretty flat in a build-up day for today as the stock market is going to be hit with numerous economic data and big earnings reports from [Apple](https://ibb.co/kqJ38mj) which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Boeing, Facebook, Tesla & many others.

We saw almost 60% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/7kH7Zjv) advancing with some companies dropping below the 50-day moving average as only 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/x6pRR2P) finished in the green, with Communications & Real Estate gaining more than 1% while Energy was the biggest laggard dropping more than 2% despite being the leader of the bunch in the early morning.

We also saw large-cap growth [companies](https://ibb.co/3svx5md) leading the way while the rest of the groups were lagging behind as you can also see in the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/S3ChnhR) from yesterday, with most of the small & mid-caps losing ground while the FAANG, Tesla, Microsoft and some other big companies were keeping the markets steady.

In terms of economic data, we saw the November housing price [index](https://ibb.co/dG3FNCJ) coming in as expected with a 11% increase y/y, which was also supported by the Shiller [Index](https://ibb.co/5ndWrBz) which indicated a 9.5% increase over last year, the biggest increase we have seen in this economic data in more than 6 years.

We also saw the January [consumer](https://ibb.co/vxdYwYy) confidence coming in better than expected at 89.3 with most of the increase coming from the expectations that consumers have of things getting better in the near future as the re-opening goes along.

Meanwhile the Richmond FED manufacturing [survey](https://ibb.co/F6PzgFL) came in at 14, lower than the 19 we saw last month as we saw a decrease in shipments, capacity utilization & volume of new orders.

In some other stock market news, we saw a lot of highly shorted stocks rise yet again🚀🚀🚀, with the forbidden one rose by more than 90% for the day and continuing with an additional 120% in after hours, while [Beyond Meat](https://ibb.co/rtQccJB) rose by 33% in early morning after announcing a partnership with [PepsiCo](https://ibb.co/wRL5s66) which is one of the biggest food companies in the world, as they will develop snack & beverage products that are plant-based.

We also saw the pot stocks rise again, with [Tilray](https://ibb.co/wpZGYPD) 🚀 leading the way after some national agencies from France tagged them to supply products for experiments in France. Tilray has been on a huge run since the Aphria merger news, and the company still has a lot of upside potential left especially if the Biden administration manages to push some sort of legislation, even if it isn’t a full-legalization in the US.

The same hopes of future help from the current administration were also seen in the EV & Hydrogen [sectors](https://ibb.co/3TwmFNC), with a lot of names like WorkHorse, Lordstown, Nikola & many others rising significantly yesterday

Some big companies also reported yesterday, as we saw General Electric [beating](https://ibb.co/0jpB660) most of the estimates in early morning and giving better than expected guidance on future free cash flow, which is a very big thing for a dividend paying company which has been struggling in the past years, while [JNJ](https://ibb.co/vQwJh52) also beat expectations and guided for even better revenues and earnings for next year as they are expecting vaccine results by next week, which could be huge for the hole stock market.

We also received a couple of big earnings reports in after hours, with [Starbucks](https://ibb.co/x3jzxHb) reporting pretty much as expected, but this high valuations for the stocks don’t really allow for OK quarters, everything needs to be exceptional for the most of the stocks to grow into these big valuations.

On the other hand, we saw [Microsoft](https://ibb.co/z8htnJC) crushing expectations, beating by almost $0.40 and a beat of more than $2.5B on revenues hitting over $40B in revenues for the first time due to the big demand in cloud revenues with Azure growing revenues by 50%, even better than the 48% in the last quarter. Microsoft also [guided](https://ibb.co/FYkGRSw) for upside in the next quarter, as this was a sleeping giant just like most of the big FAANG names which were underperformers for the better part of the end of 2020.

Meanwhile the other big tech name that reported was [AMD](https://ibb.co/fnB4Zvw), which also beat expectations due to big growth in all-areas of their business. I’ll be making a Due Diligence in AMD probably later today as I really want to see what growth they have ahead as they continue to battle with Intel

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/ZhwtrgB) are mixed, with the Nasdaq leading the way as we also await MBA mortgage applications in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/3yGpYRj), but mostly expect to see what the FED announces later in the day, as they end the two-day meeting and it is very likely Powell & The FED will keep the interest rates close to 0% and remain very dovish, probably continuing the monthly $120B assets purchase program for the foreseeable future.

There’s a few contenders here, the criteria for all of which is a high % short position. 

Top contenders: Virgin Galactic, Bed Bad and Beyond, AMC, BlackBerry, Palantir

The next short squeeze coming is AMC. AMC is only $.75c away from hitting a gamma squeeze level and we all know that this is what started the original rally in GameStop. It’s already up over 200% today, but don’t be fooled, if we see similar action, this stock can easily go above $50 and even beyond. 🚀🚀🌙🌙🌙

Of course brokers like TD and the CNBC reporters are trying to discourage us from getting into these positions, but who are they to tell us to stop? 🚀🚀

Congrats! But there's something critically important you need to know.

After the dust settles from these squeezes, after GME comes back down from 1000, after the retail sector stabilizes a bit--you need to either hold onto your profits, or LEARN about stock trading!!!

I'm seeing so many people say ""well if I was interested in stocks before I could've done this earlier, clearly it's been going up the entire year, this is easy.""
And seeing those posts makes me sad, because those people are later going to take all of their GME winnings and put it on the trusty weekly OTM calls that have given them success....and then the money will go straight back to the hedge funds writing options.


TL;DR: If you're a first-time investor, LEARN about options and trading BEFORE buying options/shares after the short squeezes end. GME at 350 is nice. But it took a long time, many red days, frustration, and disappointment to get here. HOLD ON TO THE PROFITS after this all finishes, and DO NOT RUSH to make other plays afterwards thinking you're going to multiply the money easily and be a millionaire.

TLDR:  


 

**Press Release** 

**Nokia and Elisa push network boundaries with world’s first 1T deployment** 

* Nokia raises the bar on next generation IP networks with a commercial trial to prepare Elisa’s networks for the future   

* Elisa  turbocharges its Nokia 7950 XRS routers with terabit interfaces to keep  IP network capacity ahead of the curve as new applications and access  technologies push network capacity to new limits

Like  kinda obviously you wanna take $$ profits as hedge funds are covering  their shorts. But how would I even know if this happened?  Have any  hedge funds already done this / is that the reason for the postmarket rise?

Bonus question: Would it make sense for them to cash out during or after market?  
If you do it after, retail investors can't cash out, not sure how that affects the equation.  
I would think after, but I'm kinda retarded and don't really have a good opinion on that.

I’m joking, mostly. We should dance, this is an amazing time to be where we are. Anyone on the long side of Gamestop is going to make at least life-easing money, if not life-changing money. 

In March when shit went crazy someone posted a thread with the same title when we were all gay bears shorting $SPY and anything else that was traded. People lost all their retirements, their emergency savings, everything, just regular Joe’s. Most people here promptly lost all those gains because their diamond hands were just too strong. 

This is different. This is a transfer of wealth not to Wall Street, but from it. This isn’t draining an average Joe’s retirement account, this is holding hedge funds accountable for their shitty practices, suppressing prices and market flow, handicapping companies, and preventing them from succeeding. This time, however, the math didn’t work out. Think about that, in a room full of 500 quants telling Melvin Capital what to short, they caused a cascading effect that is coining new millionaires right here. 

I have never been on the short side, but I have never liked it, shorting a company to me feels inherently evil, but profit is profit. Being long makes me feel a lot better though. GameStop is an American institution, where else can you go to get ripped off as much besides Subway? It teaches people about the depreciation of goods as soon as they leave the premises. And Melvin wanted to destroy that. 

When you are beating your chest in excitement, hooting, and hollering, remember someone is on the other side of this trade, if it is the hedge funds, fuck them, but if it is other autists or theta-gangers, that sucks, it does, because Options trading really is a zero-sum game. To make money, someone loses money, usually all of it. 

To those retail traders on the short side of this, I’ll pour one out for you, but fuck guys, what the fuck?

I know this isn't a GME post but it may be a great place to roll some tendies when GameStop hits $1000 on Friday. GME could actually hit $1000 Friday.

First, check the chart. Today CRSR is up 5% even while the broader market ate shit at open. Buyers came in hot.

After peaking at $51, The stock pulled back smartly. Since then, CRSR has been consolidating while setting higher highs and higher lows every couple of weeks.

$CRSR had a non-dilutive offering last week at $35 per share. This didn't add shares, just gave their initial PE firm a chance to cash out. With 7M shares sold at $35, this built a solid new ""floor"" for the stock on high volume at $35. Corsair easily digested this move and broke out to $40 before pulling back a bit today. Personally I used today as a chance to sell $25k in puts and buy $25k in calls for Feb 19. Will add more calls on any weakness for the rest of the week.

What does this have in common with GME? Corsair has 36% short interest (obviously lower than GME), but the main IPO lock up period doesn't expire til March. Corsair's current available float is only 20% of total shares outstanding while short interest is 36%. Not a lot of shares available for shorts to cover if the stock starts moving against them.

Last week LOGI crushed earnings, and I fully expect CRSR to do the same. I'm planning to sell the calls pre-earnings if CRSR runs $45+, but won't be buying to close the puts until near expiration. Assuming CRSR outperforms, it could break out above $50 and beyond. Worth a look imo. Always GME TO THE MOON, but this could be the next play.

Not investment advice, just my opinion. Long calls and short puts."|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212642.csv|StockTicker|['CRSR']|[]|['CRSR', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'CRSR', 'CRSR', '$CRSR', 'PE', 'M', 'I', 'GME', 'IPO', 'LOGI', 'I', 'CRSR', 'CRSR', 'CRSR', 'GME', 'TO', 'THE', 'MOON']|['GME', 'GME', 'PE', 'M', 'GME', 'LOGI', 'GME']

This company took a completely unwarranted nosedive from $6 to $3 in the 12 months prior to my purchase. Why? They halted their (very nice) dividend to conserve cash. This was not a bad thing but US boomer investors are pussies. Nokia wants to run the business like an actual business not like a ponzi scheme like Tesla. They accrued a lot of debt in the 2010s - they are Finnish, they hate debt. Why do they have debt? Massive investment in 5G infrastructure all over the world. Nokia is now positioned to be an absolute goldmine for the next generation of mobile networks. 

[https://investorplace.com/2019/11/nokia-stock-dividend-cut/](https://investorplace.com/2019/11/nokia-stock-dividend-cut/)

Since March, NOK has crept up nicely, touching $5 in Summer (no pump needed). It's currently < $7, which is basically FMV for this company going by traditional standards. Forget about the little run-up it had this week so far, that doesn't even scratch the surface of the potential here. 

So here is the deal: You want to go back in time and invest in GME at $5? Now is your chance. Nokia is at a new floor and the short squeeze has not even begun. There is no reason NOK can't get to $15+ on the basis of modern market fundamentals alone. Apply retard logic, and you can even see it hitting $100+ if the entire short bus that is WSB goes full-GME on it.

This is not an anti-GME post or some attempt to distract. Fucking diversify you idiots.

Media pushing the story of hedge funds being victims to “Reddit traders.” Of course it’s our fault they lost money - just like it’s their fault every time we lose money. 

Ever go long just to wake up to some bs report downgrade from some nobody analyst at a big firm? A random event completely unrelated to your stock forcing you to sell for a loss? A short selling firm announcing opening a position on stock you own? The examples are endless.

The fact that these hedge funds are literally crying and complaining over the major media networks is absolutely satisfying af. 

They forget they don’t control the markets - greed and fear controls the market. 

Unfortunately, I’m sure this will lead to some sort of change to help the hedge funds from incurring losses like this again. 

Still, a small victory for the little guy. And I can’t help but laugh at these old hedge fund execs going on media promoting regulation and trying to influence the sec to “hall these speculators to jail.”

I had about 20 of them over time thanks to little bits I could sneak away from the bills. 

Made me a cozy $330 this morning, all thanks to some greedy sleazy fucks who wanted to short millions of stocks to fuck companies already struggling with a changing market and a pandemic crushing their bottom lines. I had no idea what WSB even was until I saw the fallout this evening. 

Fuck GameStop, but they’re just trying to make a buck with a product. Fuck these manipulative funds that just act as billionaire cash vaults - invest in property or actual physical shit with real-world value.

EDIT: I own shares of UCO’s ETF that I bought when oil bottomed out in the negative, so I’ll see your $5k/share (that likely won’t happen because the government will fuck you over) and I’ll take my $8k-$10k/share when the Biden presidency causes oil to skyrocket (like it did when it passed $10k in 2014).

Outages Continue to Plague Online Brokerages
Mentioned:	AMC GME SCHW
By Geoffrey Rogow and Dawn Lim

Outages and interruptions rattled investors using some of the largest online brokers on Wednesday.Charles Schwab Corp., Vanguard Group, Fidelity Investments and several other online brokerages reported service disruptions, either to clients directly or on their social-media accounts. The new technical issues come after brokerage customers already encountered brief delays executing trades this week or temporarily lost access to vital account information.The service disruptions have come during a period of frenetic trading, with shares of companies such as GameStop Corp. shooting wildly higher. The volatility has been largely driven by individual investors and unmoored to the fundamentals of the underlying companies. The rising prices have prompted bearish investors to buy back shares they had sold short to cut their losses, pushing the stock higher still.None of the brokerages commented on the reason for the issues. Some surprised customers by imposing new guardrails on trading.On Wednesday, TD Ameritrade told customers that the firm was blocking some trades on GameStop, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and certain securities.""We made these decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors,"" read a notification to clients when they logged into their accounts.Schwab, which recently bought TD Ameritrade but runs an independent brokerage for now, also restricted certain transactions in GameStop and other securities. ""It is not uncommon for Charles Schwab to place restrictions on some transactions in certain securities in the interest of helping mitigate risk for our clients,"" a Schwab spokeswoman said.Schwab clients have been barred since Jan. 13 from using GameStop as collateral for a margin loan.More broadly, several of the firms have sent notices about the larger outages to customers.""Due to a technical issue, some clients are experiencing issues with online trading. We're working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. Please do not place trades again, as duplicate orders may be created. We apologize for any inconvenience,"" a notice on Charles Schwab's Twitter account read Wednesday morning. The firm told users on social media later in the day that ""access has been restored to our platforms.""A spokeswoman for Fidelity said Wednesday it was ""aware that some clients have experienced issues this morning and we are working on a resolution. We apologize for the inconvenience.""Later, the spokeswoman said the issue had been resolved, without elaborating.A spokeswoman for Vanguard said: ""We understand some Vanguard clients experienced difficulties accessing their accounts this morning. The issue has been resolved and we thank clients for their patience.""Individual investors have driven a surge in trading volumes for many online and retail-focused brokerages in the past year. Devin Ryan, an analyst with JMP Securities, said individual trading volume hit a record last year, with many brokers and wealth managers adding two or even three times as many new accounts as in 2019.Still, most trading is controlled by institutional investors.""These brokers are not systemically important players. They aren't critical to the functioning of markets. But they do speak to investor confidence,"" said Paul Rowady, director of research for market research and advisory firm Alphacution Research Conservatory.David DeKok, 67, a nonfiction author who lives in Harrisburg, Pa., said that when tried to trade Monday on his Schwab account, he got a message that he entered the wrong ticker even though he hadn't. On Wednesday, he tried to sell out of an investment that was fallingâ??and gave up after receiving that error message.""I take it in stride,"" he said. ""If this keeps happening, I'd consider changing platforms.""A Schwab spokeswoman said the company ""will work with all clients to ensure their situations are made right.""Write to Geoffrey Rogow at geoffrey.rogow@wsj.com and Dawn Lim at dawn.lim@wsj.comOutages Continue to Plague Online Brokerages

&#x200B;

Nokia and AMC are doing well! Congrats to the retards who got in early, but I would be wary. I'm not hating on the gains, but doesn't anyone find it odd how these two stocks traded over a BILLION in volume today? Sure, AMC's 900m debt relief might be a plus but I'll suck off my wife's step-boyfriend if that's the reason it shot up 300%+ today.

&#x200B;

And what's up with NOK?? They might have decent long term prospects, but there's literally no good reason for all this volume today. By \*pure\* chance, a good number of the bigger stock brokers all had some ""issues"" when it came to trading GME. \[TD claims that the problem was volume\]([https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-amc-trading-is-now-being-restricted-at-td-ameritrade-11611769804](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-amc-trading-is-now-being-restricted-at-td-ameritrade-11611769804)), but how could this be the case when GME only traded 90m volume today, not even a tenth of AMC?

&#x200B;

All of this happening while we have bots FLOODING this sub with low effort garbage about buying these stocks? What are they hoping to achieve? Are they trying to \[artificially link WSB to these stocks?\]([https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/27/gamestop-amc-reddit-short-sellers-wallstreetbets/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/27/gamestop-amc-reddit-short-sellers-wallstreetbets/)) Are they trying to deceive new subs to buy these stocks? Are they doing their own pump and dump to offset some of their losses? I don't know.

&#x200B;

\*What I do know\* is that I'm ALL IN on GME, and I don't plan to sell before next week. CNBC can try as hard as they want to spread misinformation, I can't hear them anyway from inside my 🚀. Every day we hold is another day the short interest burns. They're not getting shares from these 💎🙌.

Long time user that recently got back in the game.
I was wondering, would this attention and popularity not be a great opportunity to kick start some good in this world? GME is a great company but can we not support GME whilst also investing in a company that makes cheap insulin, or cost effective electric batteries, or advanced PVs etc.

I’m not going to suggest a ticker up here, I wouldn’t give the SEC and MMS the satisfaction. But I would love to here some suggestions for world helping companies we could invest in as a team below in the comments.

We already reset the status quo in terms of who decides if a company succeeds in the market, could we now reset who is seen as valuable?

Going to bed now, I look forward to reading suggestions in the morning over coffee.

Before you autists get all frothy at me, I'm not telling anyone to give up their 💎🙌. The beauty of stocks is that you can own more than one.

AMC opened today at 4x the price, after trending up for days. It bounced around half its ATH of $35, before closing at 300% gain for the day.

GME hit $380 today, up six times its all time high of $63. The current GME price scares away non-autist retail investors, and at that price, new buyers will be expending multiples more capital for the same upward pressure.

If you don't believe me, look at the numbers. As GME is hitting mainstream and is the big hotness on this sub, AMC also outperformed GME by 165% by close today.

Also, #saveAMC is already trending as it gains traction across social media. People are actively looking for a new GME they feel they missed the boat on.

https://twitter.com/reddittrading/status/1354479260363354117

Despite how low the price already was, it has a record number of shorts: over 38 million. This means another short squeeze isn't just on the menu - it's already starting. It's the third most shorted stock out there, despite its clearly viable future. This doesn't distract from GME's slaughter of hedge funds because it's the next wave of their an hero.

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/

AMC has raised a billion dollars to weather out coronavirus, amid an ongoing ""Safe & Clean"" push. Some studios like WB are moving to parallel releases on HBO Max, but AMC is already throwing out deals to get people in the door. Meanwhile, Hollywood has been sitting on blockbusters after watching Tenet and WW1984 eat shit on streaming:

https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean

https://screenrant.com/tenet-box-office-failure-warner-bros-2021-movies-impact/

Their debt/equity ratio has also been trending positively, even as coronavirus has intensified. Just a return to the mean suggests ridiculous gain, even ignoring the likelihood of pent-up demand. AMC has legs not just for the next week, but for the next few quarters.

https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMC/amc-entertainment-holdings/debt-equity-ratio

Coronavirus, the main cause for AMC's big downturn, is on the way out as vaccines will be available to all by spring, just ahead of summer blockbuster season.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-biden-anyone-spring/

In the long term, after hedge fund shorters lose their ass on GME, brick and mortar game stores will have less of a future, with or without coronavirus. It's easier to digitally download games, and hardware can be bought online and received the next day from any number of retailers. There's no way to mount a 20 foot screen in your house. Unless, of course, you buy AMC stock now.

People view $AMC the same way they view $GME - just another brick & mortar Mall company that is essentially being destroyed by $AMZN Prime, HBO Max, and Disney+. Fair enough, but I enjoy watching a new release in IMAX with a flatbread pizza in one hand, and a flavored Coke in my other. I think many others do to.

To address everyone who doesn't care about IMAX or going to theaters, $AMC has to simply do ONE VERY SIMPLE THING that will literally blow the minds of the un-imaginative analysts who are predicting doom.  All $AMC has to do is rename ""**AMC Theatres On Demand**"", the program they started in 2019, to **AMC+**.

AMC+ will be a studio-independant platform for movies, documentaries and TV shows. No monthly fee, but rather an revenue-sharing a la carte pricing system. Of course I'd love to see $AMC poach some talent from $NFLX or $DIS when they announce AMC+. One can dream!

TL;DR- $AMC can pivot hard by simply relaunching their existing ""AMC Theatres On Demand"" to AMC+.

AMC Theatres On Demand is mentioned on page 47 of [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000141157920000074/amc-20200930x10q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000141157920000074/amc-20200930x10q.htm)

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, why do I want to see AMC be the next GME? 

Because I'm from the 90's (which indeed makes me an old fuck). The reason I loved the idea of pushing GME is because it reminds me of my childhood. I used to love going to EBs (which merged with GME), browsing games, buying them and looking at the booklets.

It's the same reason I love AMC. The movie theaters were an escape for me growing up. I'm not going to give a sob story because no one gives a shit... in fact, I'm sure no one gives a shit about anything I just said.

&#x200B;

**DD:**

1. BBBY is one of the highest shorted stocks following GME with a 84 short percentage of float
2. The CEO who turned around Target joined BBBY in Nov 2019, since then, he had kicked out and replaced all original C-Suite
3. BBBY has been transforming and selling all non-core business for profitability and better liquidity
4. The company announced a $675 Million share buyback in the next 3 years, given current share price, that will reduce the amount of shares by 15%, which essentially making BBBY another more than 100% shorted company
5. Guess who also shorts BBBY? Yeah fucking Melvin. Read their 13F, as of Nov 2020, the $ amount of their BBBY short positions is actually higher than their GME short positions. When they are forced to liquidate their positions, BBBY will be short-squeezed as well

BBBY is like the little brother of GME. There is no conflict between buying BBBY and GME, it is another way to fuck Melvin without paying extreme high premiums on GME calls.

1) Nokia has 5.5 Billion shares outstanding. GameStop has 65 million and amc has 150 million. The 3 million poor autists here aren’t gonna be able to push up the price for nok because the people who own the other 5 billion shares will just sell.


2) NOK has a market cap of $37 billion which means it can’t rise so much. GameStop started at like a 4billion market cap and now at $350 a share is $35 billion. If NOK went to 350 a share it would be the biggest company in the world. Not happening retards

I've been here since 2016 and I've seen some fucked up shit. I have even been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stonk Disorder (PTSD).

Some of you are up 200, 300, 400% on your GME positions right now, and still holding. I commend you for your diamond sacks, but lets not underestimate how evil, greedy, and cunning, big money can be.

Short interest is around 98% last I looked at the Ortex data a few hours ago.

#NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH OF THE CURRENT SHORT POSITIONS WERE OPENED AT THESE NEW LEVELS

At this point, all of the original shorts who were deeply underwater, have covered and gotten out. There is no doubt about that. Why does it matter?

These new shorts which were opened at current levels ARE NOT GOING TO MATTER AS MUCH UNLESS WE GET ANOTHER HUGE MOVEMENT UPWARD. And at this point, honestly ask yourself, what is the catalyst? Every retail investor has already heard about this and bought in, if they were going to. It's not like millions of normies are going to be pouring in to help push the price up to fuck the next level of shorts and cause another squeeze. 

I hate to break it to everyone, but the squeeze people were talking about 2 weeks ago ***HAS ALREADY HAPPENED***.

Is it possible another squeeze on these new short positions could happen? ***ABSOFUCKINGLUTELY***, However..

At this point, what is going to set this thing off? The Ryan Cohen news combined with a swarm of retards on here going all in is what triggered the first squeeze. Then we had news coverage, Elon and Chamath tweeting as the cherry on top. Is it possible that Ryan Cohen drops some big news within the next week or so to pop off short squeeze round 2? Sure. Is it possible some big whale comes along and decides to pump it and fuck the next round of shorts? Sure. But what im saying is, we already got a round of catalysts that were highly unlikely. It is not likely to get any better than we already got. 

#IF YOU ARE UP OVER 100% IT MAY BE TIME TO CALL IT. THERE IS A VERY GOOD CHANCE THAT WE WILL NOT GET ANOTHER BIG CATALYST TO SET OFF SHORT SQUEEZE ROUND TWO. Big money is doing shady shit, there is all sorts of manipulations going on, and just like we saw with the VW squeeze, this will come back down to earth, eventually. If you think GME is still going to be over 300 in a few weeks, you are fucking high. 

I don't know what else to say at this point. There's almost no DD going on here at this point. Every normie and their mother knows whats going on with GME. It's no longer a secret, you aren't getting in early at this point, and some of you are going to be surprised when it comes out that this big short squeeze you hoped for isnt coming because MM, big banks, and big money hedge funds LIED and did shady shit behind the scenes to prevent it.

I guarantee you Chamath closed out his small position already. Michael Burry also has and he even tweeted yesterday about how current levels are concerning. Last but not least, some of you seem to be under the impression that u/DeepFuckingValue is still holding because he thinks it's going to keep going up to 10k. ***He's holding still because it's been his baby for over a year now, he already pulled out a life changing amount of money so he probably doesn't care if it goes back down to 60, and lastly, he's holding as a fuck you to Melvin and company.*** This guy has balls of steel, I wouldn't be surprised if he held until expiration just to prove a point. I don't think this is about money to him anymore, and I don't think its wise or appropriate to interpret his refusal to sell as a sign of conviction in the current price levels, let alone a future price level of $1000.

Lastly, for those of you who have made 100+% returns in just a few days, do you really want to risk it? You realize this is a once in a lifetime event. You will never get this chance again, and if something happens and this thing comes back to earth, you will ***NEVER FORGIVE YOURSELF FOR NOT WALKING AWAY WHEN YOU WERE UP 300% on fucking SHARES ALONE***. ***YOU WILL HATE YOURSELF FOR BEING GREEDY, JUST LIKE MELVIN GOT GREEDY.***.

#SOME OF YOU HAVE WON THE GAME! YOU WON! NOW YOURE JUST TRYING TO RUB DIRT IN THE LOSING TEAMS FACE. EVEN IF THEY DESERVE IT, (WHICH THEY DO) WE NEED TO CONSIDER THAT THIS ISNT GOING TO LAST FOREVER, AND IT MIGHT BE TIME TO CALL IT IF YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO MAKE A 100, 200, 300% RETURN IN 2 FUCKING DAYS.

#No, I am not a bot you fucking idiot, look at my post history.

#Yes, I got out of my GME position earlier today. My total return on GME since last week is 460%. I am happy with that and I am not going to be DUPED into holding by bots and 500k new traders who have no experience and are just bandwagoning space ship emojis. I know better. When the normies flow in, I flow out. 

Good luck and god speed brothers."|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212651.csv|StockTicker|['T', 'BE', 'TUPID', 'IT', 'MAY', 'BE', 'TIME', 'TO', 'CALL']|['T', 'IT', 'TIME', 'CALL']|['I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'OBODY', 'KNOWS', 'HOW', 'MUCH', 'OF', 'THE', 'RRENT', 'SHORT', 'TIONS', 'WERE', 'PENED', 'AT', 'THESE', 'NEW', 'EVELS', 'ARE', 'NOT', 'GOING', 'TO', 'ATTER', 'AS', 'MUCH', 'NLESS', 'WE', 'GET', 'OTHER', 'HUGE', 'EMENT', 'PWARD', 'I', 'HAS', 'READY', 'IF', 'YOU', 'ARE', 'UP', 'OVER', 'IT', 'MAY', 'BE', 'TIME', 'TO', 'CALL', 'IT', 'THERE', 'IS', 'A', 'VERY', 'GOOD', 'HANCE', 'THAT', 'WE', 'WILL', 'NOT', 'GET', 'OTHER', 'BIG', 'ALYST', 'TO', 'SET', 'OFF', 'SHORT', 'UEEZE', 'ROUND', 'TWO', 'VW', 'GME', 'I', 'DD', 'GME', 'MM', 'LIED', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'NEVER', 'RGIVE', 'RSELF', 'FOR', 'NOT', 'LKING', 'AWAY', 'WHEN', 'YOU', 'WERE', 'UP', 'HARES', 'YOU', 'WILL', 'HATE', 'RSELF', 'FOR', 'BEING', 'REEDY', 'JUST', 'LIKE', 'ELVIN', 'GOT', 'REEDY', 'SOME', 'OF', 'YOU', 'HAVE', 'WON', 'THE', 'GAME', 'YOU', 'WON', 'NOW', 'YOURE', 'JUST', 'RYING', 'TO', 'RUB', 'DIRT', 'IN', 'THE', 'OSING', 'TEAMS', 'FACE', 'EVEN', 'IF', 'THEY', 'SERVE', 'IT', 'WHICH', 'THEY', 'WE', 'NEED', 'TO', 'SIDER', 'THAT', 'THIS', 'ISNT', 'GOING', 'TO', 'LAST', 'REVER', 'AND', 'IT', 'MIGHT', 'BE', 'TIME', 'TO', 'CALL', 'IT', 'IF', 'YOU', 'HAVE', 'READY', 'BEEN', 'LUCKY', 'NOUGH', 'TO', 'MAKE', 'A', 'ETURN', 'IN', 'CKING', 'DAYS', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'DUPED', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'AT', 'ARE', 'HAS', 'ARE', 'IT', 'TIME', 'CALL', 'IT', 'GOOD', 'BIG', 'TWO', 'GME', 'DD', 'GME', 'MM', 'FOR', 'AWAY', 'FOR', 'GAME', 'NOW', 'IT', 'IT', 'TIME', 'CALL', 'IT', 'GME', 'GME']

2) Ongoing discussions over market regulations are happening behind closed doors between lawmakers, the SEC, and top brokerage firms/money managers

3) The current narrative is that GME is a story about ordinary Joe Retail taking on Wall Street greed and corruption- the Chamath interview solidified that. The public is on the side of Retail at this moment. Any attempts to introduce regulations to limit the activities of retail traders would receive significant public backlash.

4) An effort between top lawmakers and mainstream media is fomenting to change the narrative. 

5) Mainstream media outlets will begin solely blaming wsb for the GME debacle, they will begin to paint us as a “fringe group”, they will dig up whatever posts they can to try and portray us as radical, alt-right, racist, etc. They will accuse us of coordinating an effort to deliberately destroy hedge funds, although they will not say the word hedge fund, they will say we have caused major losses in the pension and retirement portfolios of retirees, veterans, police and firefighters, teachers, etc Public perception will flip on wsb. 

6) regulations will be introduced. The general public will accept these regulations and blame wsb for them. 

7) Wall Street greed and corruption thrives while our meme stock gainz languish 

Please pass the message! If you have ever posted anything on WSb That can be used by the media to falsely paint us as a group of radicals or undesirables, delete it!

We all need to continue this fight. GME is a company that has a plan and a new face in Ryan Cohen. If GME can make it out of this, this share price is here to stay. Look at the valuations of other retail companies with significant e-commerce revenue, GME has significant room to go up from here! Hold strong.

AMC’s issues are 100% the result of COVID. They were at peak revenue in 2019. The vaccines are here, the movies are coming out, the people can’t wait to go outside and socialize again. Theatres are one of the places where people socialize. It will come back. This value is good.

It's still under $15, less than half its ATH of $35.

GME hit $380 today, up *six times* its all time high of $63. That ridiculous price jump is going to scare away non-autist retail investors, and at that price, new buyers will be expending multiples more capital for the same upward pressure. I'm willing to bet that most of the diamond hang gang are in GME up to their tits and now going through their mothers' purse for more capital.

Also, #saveAMC is already trending, while people are *actively looking* for a new GME they feel they missed the boat on.

https://www.thestreet.com/investing/amc-shares-outerspace

Despite how low the price already was, it has a record number of shorts - over 38 million, meaning another short squeeze is on the menu.

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/

AMC has raised a billion dollars to weather out coronavirus, they have a ""Safe & Clean"" push, and they are going to be throwing out deals to everyone for them to come see the blockbusters that Hollywood has been sitting on after watching Tenet and WW1984 eat shit on streaming:

https://variety.com/2021/film/global/amc-raises-debt-financing-1234891278/

https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean

Coronavirus, the main cause for AMC's big downturn, is on the way out as vaccines will be available to all by spring, just ahead of summer blockbuster season.

Brick and mortar game stores *will* have less of a future, with or without coronavirus. There is no way to mount a 20 foot screen in your house. Unless, of course, you buy AMC stock now.

Alright fellow Autists and Autits - here's the nitty gritty: **Wall Street is scared SHITLESS** today with all the retail buying in **NOK**. This may very well be GME 2.0 - *not* because of the short interest, but because of the blatant manipulation attempts by using Halts. Here is why they are scared...

**530 MILLION shares traded**

As of the time of this post, 530 MILLION shares have traded today compared to a meager 65 million shares traded daily on average. That's nearly 10x the usual daily volume!!! This volume shows our WSB army is strong and they are scrambling in fear!!!! (Hope they wore their brown pants)

**NOK making new highs at $8.81**

At the time of this post, NOK is currently trading at $6.67, down from the ATH of $8.81! It would be trading higher if it weren't for the volatility halts - MM's attempts at keeping price low. But we will not relent!!!

**Gamma Squeeze Incoming!**

\- Here's where things get extra extra spicy!!! Jan 29 Call Options only go up to a $8 strike. This morning, Open Interest was a staggering 150,345 contracts - of which 127,301 contracts are currently ITM!!!!

\- In ADDITION to the Open Interest, 278,065 moar contracts have traded today!!

\- As of right now, it is estimated that if price hits $7 by Friday, 408,777 contracts will be IN THE FUCKING MONEY which translates to an additional **40,877,000 SHARES that will need to be bought for option holders this FRIDAY**.

**tl;dr NOK looks very very ripe and tasty for a Gamma Squeeze this Friday which may drive shares up even further!**

**Obligatory:** I am but a fellow Autist and thus not an investment professional, and this is not to be considered investment advice.

**EDIT:** Shares needed to purchase by Friday corrected. I'm an obvious autist and shouldn't be trading but wtf do I know?!?!?"|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212653.csv|StockTicker|['NOK', 'RIDAY']|['NOK']|['S', 'DO', 'OUR', 'PART', 'PVOTE', 'FOR', 'OUR', 'ELLOW', 'TISTS', 'TO', 'GME', 'LLION', 'LLION', 'WSB', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'ATH', 'ITM', 'ITION', 'IN', 'THE', 'CKING', 'MONEY', 'HARES', 'NOK', 'I', 'I']|['S', 'DO', 'FOR', 'GME', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK']

HOLD THE ROCKET 🚀 .

&#x200B;

# DID Papa Elon approved AMC? NO

# DOES AMC has Papa Ryan Cohen? NO

# First of all, FFL is just 68, not even close to GME 100+.

# Secondly, it is really really cheap to borrow. It is just so cheap to borrow that big boys can hold them like forever without even think about covering...

# Last, the SI dropped significantly, so buy at your own risk, yes you are holding long. But without shorts compete with you, you are just playing offline.

&#x200B;

# Then again, we are creating history, we are saying NO to this rigged system only works for manipulators. Do not get distracted by shitty posts and DDs.

AMC is the largest movie theater chain in the country. The pandemic has hurt small business, movie theaters included. The pandemic has concentrated market share on the biggest players, meaning AMC now dominates more of the pie. 

Theaters aren't going away anytime soon. Nicholas Christakis predicted in Apollo's Arrow that we will see a Roaring 20s after the vaccine. The Roaring 20s will see theaters and movie industry boom just like it has historically. Media companies will release a floodgate of movies and demand will be sky high for a while. 

AMC is poised to capture most of that demand and growth, especially given its recent investments into upgrading theaters. Imagine the hype coming from higher demand, tons of stimulus money, and backed up releases. 

300 shares $AMC @ 5.10

TLDR

The largest theater chain in the country will gobble up the remains of the weaker business that couldn't survive the pandemic. AMC will gain a greater share of the pie for greater long term growth. Roaring 20s will see business boom. AMC to the moon. 

And buy the dip! Going right back to $23.

I have better data supporting this, just on mobile right now. Will update with figures. BTW, check Google trends today, AMC tops the results!

Never posted because I just like lurking the sub. All of this talk of GME recently has left the sub feeling one dimensional and seems to discourage other potential winning stocks. 

People seem to think everything is a comparison to GME. It isn't. Some people want to invest in BB because it looks more promising with it's tech and pivoting market strategy. Some people want AMC because it tanked due to a pandemic and they want to keep the largest movie theater chain alive or see the potential in recovery. (AMC was over $30 pre-COVID.)

There are many posts discouraging or dissuading people from investing in other companies, but particularly those 2. Yes I'm on the GME rocket 🚀🚀🚀. But that doesn't mean I can't make other healthy investments that have potential too.

In March of 2020, small biotech —Inovio Pharmaceuticals—announced that they designed THE COVID vaccine within 3 hours. Their CEO (Dr. Kim)—while on national TV and surrounded by big pharma execs—told Donald Trump that they had developed the vaccine in “Warp Speed”. Soon after, you have “Operation Warp Speed”

Since then, INO has been MERCILESSLY attacked by big pharma and cronies like Andrew Left/Citron (27th most shorted stock on Wall Street)—it has frankly been a nightmare and stolen a lot of money from retail investors, but also robbed the world of THE vaccine.

Brief background:

• INO is the ONLY company to EVER produce a successful coronavirus vaccine. INO-4700 for MERS which gained EUA in 2017 in South Korea. Because of their YEARS of developing this vaccine (when working on a coronavirus vaccine was boring), they are YEARS ahead in what was required to formulate a vaccine to combat COVID.

• INO-4800 is the SAFEST (HANDS DOWN) COVID vaccine with not even a single recorded instance of even moderate side effects, let alone the abundance of SEVERE side effects that ALL of the others produce!

• INO-4800 can be stored at room temp FOR A YEAR. Anyone familiar with the MAJOR issues occurring with the extreme cold temp requirements for Pfizer and Moderna?

• INO is the ONLY ONE to prove LONG TERM PROTECTION. This is done via CD8+ T cells. Compare the data across animal trials. INO proved over 17 weeks of protection (and counting) in their primate study. NONE of the other prominent COVID players produce CD8+ T cells at a measurable enough level to make any impact. Their antibody protection wanes within a few months. The long term protection elicited by INO-4800 is consistent with their other coronavirus vaccine which has proven protection for over 38 weeks now.

• MUTATIONS—INO specifically engineered their vaccine to be very broad in order to combat the mutations and effectively be a UNIVERSAL COVID VACCINE. The others are too narrow in scope and did not account for this. Due to INO’s YEARS of coronavirus development, they accounted precisely for this.

• CELLECTRA DEVICE—INO has a patented device to administer their vaccine which allows ALL of their vaccines to not only be supremely safe, but to extremely OPTIMIZE vaccine intake. They do this through electroporation which they’ve been working to perfect for DECADES. We have FINALLY reached the future they have worked towards. CELLECTRA will revolutionize the entire field of vaccines.

I could go on and on, but my point is that if there’s going to be a short squeeze; there would be NONE sweeter than to roast the shorts who are attacking the company creating the SOLUTION to COVID and MANY OTHER DISEASES. The SEC has stood idle, the FDA is complicit in doling out senseless delays/halts, the medical journal that published phase 1 data delayed it MONTH AFTER MONTH until Pfizer and Moderna came to market.

Guys, if there was ever a stock to galvanize behind to force a short squeeze, it’s for INO"|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212658.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['BIG', 'HARMA', 'HORTS', 'INO', 'THE', 'COVID', 'CEO', 'TV', 'INO', 'ESSLY', 'THE', 'INO', 'ONLY', 'EVER', 'MERS', 'EUA', 'YEARS', 'YEARS', 'COVID', 'AFEST', 'HANDS', 'COVID', 'EVERE', 'ALL', 'FOR', 'A', 'YEAR', 'MAJOR', 'INO', 'ONLY', 'ONE', 'LONG', 'TERM', 'CTION', 'T', 'INO', 'NONE', 'COVID', 'T', 'INO', 'ERSAL', 'COVID', 'CCINE', 'YEARS', 'ECTRA', 'INO', 'ALL', 'IMIZE', 'CADES', 'NALLY', 'ECTRA', 'I', 'NONE', 'UTION', 'COVID', 'MANY', 'OTHER', 'EASES', 'SEC', 'FDA', 'MONTH', 'AFTER', 'MONTH']|['BIG', 'INO', 'CEO', 'TV', 'INO', 'INO', 'EVER', 'ALL', 'FOR', 'INO', 'ONE', 'LONG', 'T', 'INO', 'T', 'INO', 'INO', 'ALL']

Of course, the target price might move in phases (33.10, 331.0 and 3310) but the final goal (3310) is clear and inevitable.

If TD Ameritrade and Robin Hood can’t handle a few sell offs now then how are they going to handle it when it goes nuclear? I mean this completely genuinely as a kid who has been in with you guys from the beginning of this run with not a lot of money if I can’t exercise it then it’s all just been numbers on a screen. 

Since I was unable to sell I’m kind of stuck for the long-haul but this is as serious a question I have ever asked on wsb because I really feel like a lot of us are going to get screwed when selling."|2021-01-27 21:26:04.929435|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_212659.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'TD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['TD']

Based on technical fundamentals and the hard lesson I’ve learned from WSB after at some point betting against GME and learning to be a bull. 

Reasons why to invest in AMC:

1) DON’T bet against 💎🤲🏻 ppl because you may have small wins but will suffer big losses like I did by betting against them. 

2)GME ppl may be upset at this but I believe AMC actually offers a service you can’t get anywhere else unless you’re willing to wait months or a year to watch the latest movies. 

3) PRECOVID ppl were still going to the movies and spending money at the theaters. PRECOVID guidelines destroyed the stock price

4)PRECOVID the stock normal price was about $30-35. I expect as the states open up and COVID becomes the next flu and actors start making new movies, people will flood back to the movie theaters after being away for so long. THUS, AMC will start making money and the stock price will KEEP GOING UP

5) Even with offerings and 🌈🐻, AMC is a established company and BANKRUPTCY BEING OFF THE TABLE, make this a  STRONG LONG HOLD 🚀🚀

6) I don’t believe this will have that many 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 as GME because it’s not shorted over 100%

Has not increased much compared to the other popular heavily shorted stocks (GME, AMC, BBBY, FIZZ, FUBO...). Seems cheaper relative to its heavily shorted peers.

Good income and growth. Actually making a profit.

High ""earning per share"" ratio.

Is profitable today, seems profitable in the future. Analysts are optimistic.

I am not capable of doing a financial analysis myself but from what I've seen, seems like a good stock for now. At the very least for the next month or so. For the long term, I have absolutely no fucking idea.

Their stock has dropped from a 1-year high of $35 when their acquisition by Cineworld was announced, and steeply dropped as the pandemic worsened. Their current share price is $11.50 Canadian dollars, or $8.98 US dollars. Their stock was pushing $55 CAD until mid-2017. They hold a majority of the theatre market share in Canada with 175 theatres and 75% market share. They’re also a short-seller’s favourite, with 2.2 million of 62.34 million shares held by short sellers. 

They mainly operate typical movie theatre screens, but they also offer an increasing number of premium VIP theatres. They have diversified their income streams, owning “The Rec Room” eats and entertainment experiences, with nice restaurants, VR experiences, and more. They should be opening a new 40,000 sqft Rec Room in Burnaby, BC once vaccination rates rise. They additionally have stakes in esports through Player One, and own two advertising companies named Cineplex Media and Cineplex Digital Media.

However, there is potential risk, particularly regarding their botched deal with Cineworld going to court, but I personally don’t think Cineworld will come out on top as their claims don’t hold much water (they’re upset Cineplex didn’t “operate as required under the acquisition deal” as a result of closing under public health orders during the pandemic, but their deal allows for “emergencies and acts of God”.)
