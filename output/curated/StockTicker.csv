And was asked to post this as a discussion.

The most important thing is actually **until Friday there** will be another **price** battle in which the short sellers will try to keep as many calls as possible outside the price so that they cannot be executed and the broker does not have to buy them on the market to cover them .  
It is particularly critical because **monthly and weekly calls** expire, as far as I know the highest monthly call was **60c 1/29** and **115c 1/29** (left out the new 200c).

The MM will try everything to push the course **below 60** , **our goal to get to 115** . Until then, **expect massive short attacks** , it will probably be even more blatant than yesterday. Since a price limit is harder to keep higher up, don't be surprised if there is a red tag up until then or the lower limit is 60-80.  
For those of you who don't know what is meant, 100xLimit orders at $ 60 are $ 6000 <$ 11500 100x at $ 115 and easier to hold or buy from autistic people.

And almost most importantly **, put your stop loss out** , the **shortsellers try** to trigger as many as possible with their short sales in order to trigger **a chain reaction of panic selling** .

Remember **yesterday we saw exactly that** , price dumping at its finest, although almost no short position was powered.

Should we be **able to hold the $ 115 by Friday** , the banks (! Not the shortsellers) would have to buy an additional 8 million shares to cover the demand for the calls. To achieve this there is really only the possibility üöÄ‚úãüèªüíéü§öüèª,

**Don't be a paper bitch!**

All figures relate to estimates and information or assumptions and observations from DD from here and the Angelsachen forum. Due to the high trading volume, it is not possible to say how the share is currently distributed !!

**This is not a financial advice, but an autistic one.** **Always invest wisely and make your own decisions.**

And now relax America won't open for another 4 hours anyway.

Keeping holding and relax.**

With a lot of chatter going around and some excellent DD being shared with lots of technical analysis there still seems to be doubt as to 1) If the squeeze is happening, and 2) How to capitalize on it.  Please spend a few minutes reading this so you're more informed as a trader (even if this is your first time being a trader).  This is not a technical analysis but more a plain English guide:

1. **Crazy price volatility:** I think this one is self-explanatory but if you're wondering what price volatility looks like go check out a Google chart from the past week or so.  A stock moving up 20%+ day after day after day is not typical.
2. **Those who stand to lose the most go on the offensive:** At this point it is fairly well established that WSB has many user accounts being used for a variety of purposes, but at the moment many of those accounts are trying to drum up emotional responses to counter the short squeeze.  People hyping new tickers with far less short-term upside, saying that the facts are not true (remember kids: you're entitled to opinions but not your own facts).
3. **Those who stand to lose are taking MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR life lines:** Again, this so self-explanatory but yet still not all of us believe that a squeeze is happening.  During the 2008/2009 crash there were MAJOR US BANKS that were getting $2-5BN in bailout money to prevent the entire economy from collapsing.  Yesterday a relatively small hedge fund posing ZERO systemic risk took a $2.75BN bailout that without it would have likely seen them disappear from the system with ZERO impact to our greater economy as a whole.
4. **Confusion:** Have you noticed that some of the ""smartest guys in the room"" can't seem to agree on television and in the media as to what is going on??  If you actually believe that there is some debate going on amongst the experienced and elite Wall Street types then there may be no hope for you in life.  Con artists prey on the gullible and you will be a slaughtered sheep soon.
5. **Just f-ing hold if you like money!!:** If the above four bullet points haven't convinced you then nothing will so just sit back, relax, and let the men do our work.  If your wrists get weak and your paper hands get so feeble that you sell at these low prices then we (the real men of this sub) are better off without you owning the stock anyway.  AND STOP BUYING OPTIONS YOU STUPID IDIOTS! Calls were great to have bought in 2019, even into mid-to-late 2020, but the price you're paying for them now is a rip-off.  AND, the volatility on the price means your chances of losing money have never been better!

Warren Buffett has famously said at multiple shareholder meetings that he doesn't want people owning Berkshire stock if they're the type of *investor* that trades in and out of positions.  He wants long-holders, people that believe in the mission of the company, believe in the management, and want to get wealthy, NOT RICH.

**You might be in the middle of something that will not happen to you again EVER in your investing life, or perhaps only a handful of times from now until you retire.  Don't screw it up by thinking that jumping off the fastest moving train, and one that is unique and a statistical anomaly, is going to happen again on some other ticker that has gotten the unfortunate meme status that the elite are trying to trick you into right now.**

NOK, BB, and others may all go up in the future and if you want to invest in them then you should wait.  How long??  Who knows.  And who cares?!?!?  You're probably in your 20's or even teens, you have plenty of time to invest in many good companies in your lifetime but quite likely NONE will go through this kind of movement over a period of a few weeks and if you sell now (you paper handed p-ssy) you will never forgive yourself.  HOLD, be patient, let the shorts bleed themselves to death, and in the meantime go focus on something other than Reddit!

Good luck to all.

***EDIT: I somehow forgot to add positions.  In keeping with the suggestion of others not to broadcast exact holdings (don't show the enemies your positions!) I will just say I have a high six-figure position of SHARES ONLY and I haven't even thought about selling for a moment.  This is not my biggest holding and my life won't be changed whether it eventually settles at $50/share or $500/share and YOURS WON'T EITHER SO BE STRONG.***

***EDIT II: Stop calling it a ""Loss"" if you bought at $X and it is now below $X.  An actual loss has not occurred until AFTER you sell, and if you don't sell then you won't lose.  It is not more complicated than that.  Seasoned investors (which are on the other side of every trade that you do) rely on you being emotional because they are using a computer with no emotion at all.  Don't be the sucker and don't actually lose money when instead you could actually have a gain!***"|2021-01-26 13:30:25.666589|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_133025.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['RMENT', 'DD', 'I', 'A', 'WSB', 'LLION', 'OLLAR', 'MAJOR', 'US', 'BANKS', 'BN', 'ZERO', 'BN', 'ZERO', 'AND', 'STOP', 'UYING', 'TIONS', 'YOU', 'TUPID', 'DIOTS', 'AND', 'NOT', 'RICH', 'EVER', 'NOK', 'BB', 'NONE', 'HOLD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'HARES', 'ONLY', 'I', 'YOURS', 'T', 'ITHER', 'SO', 'BE', 'TRONG', 'EDIT', '$X', '$X', 'AFTER']|['DD', 'I', 'A', 'EVER', 'NOK', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'T', 'SO', 'X', 'X']

Wow - what a week. This is an extension of my DD series on GME. If you haven‚Äôt read them and have time, they will provide some background on my previous predictions, some of which have already come true. 

# Previous Important Posts

* [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) (DTC Infinity) covered the short positions, the float, and potential snowball impacts of increasing prices, and argued that part of the reason that shorts haven‚Äôt closed was that it was pretty much impossible for shorts to close 
* [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) covered Cohen, fair market cap analysis, and potential investors, in which I talked about the amazing mid-to-long term potential for GME. 
* After the Citron tweet, I shared this [fan fiction on what looked like blatant market manipulation by shorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) on the day of the tweet, and offered some education on strengthening your position. This one got buried and is worth reading. 

# What‚Äôs happened thus far

### Why did GME go up on Friday? 

The story here is more complex than paid media articles would like you to believe. GME has been driven up by 3 different forces: 

* Organic buying
   * There is a mixture of growing positive sentiment in the investor world (not just WSB) about GME‚Äôs future
   * There‚Äôs been a lot of good due diligence shared not just on WSB but even outside (for example, see gmedd.com)
   * The Citron Backfire
      * Shorts were on the ropes and kept looking for hail mary‚Äôs. They went to Citron and [coordinated a dump](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) to try to bring the price down.
      * However, this backfired. Citron is so disliked in the industry that new wealth poured into GME in the face of Andrew Left‚Äôs pleas. Even when Benzinga brought Andrew Left on air, **minutes after he left** [they bought shares live on their show](https://youtu.be/mFiFWBrE5DE?t=5104)**.** 
      * The next day, our very on u/Uberkikz11 [was on Benzinga](https://youtu.be/GLzTU87MJMM?t=837) and more shares were bought. 
   * Larger investors piling in
      * In my [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/), I hypothesized that we‚Äôd soon see larger investors pile in. Then, on WSB, we saw posts from a [venture capitalist](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/) as well as a [hedge fund investor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/)
* Gamma squeeze
   * Once the organic buying started, we rolled into a gamma squeeze. Many people written about the gamma squeeze so I won‚Äôt repeat, see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/) for an example. 
* Ultra low liquidity - In EndGame part 1, I talked about how the actual actively traded shares are much lower than the reported float, and **share availability has been reducing** driven by lots of diamond hands, not just among smaller guys like us but the larger folks too. 
* I believe there were some short covers on Friday, but Ortex was still estimating 71M shares short at the eod. 

However, not many people have talked about why it **went down**

### Why did GME come down? 

Here‚Äôs where things got interesting for me, and something I think happened again today (Monday) when GME climbed up over 100% but then had a rapid reversal, closing 20% above yesterday but closing below open. 

So Friday looked like a slam dunk - gamma squeeze, no shorts available to short, puts were getting exceedingly expensive as a short tactic. What happened?

This is my fan fiction, based on what I saw.

**I believe** [**market-makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) **took a non-neutral stance and began actively shorting the stock after the second halt.** 

Market-makers are responsible for maintaining liquidity and functioning in the stock market, but they also have abilities that others don‚Äôt - for example they are legally allowed to naked short for ‚Äúliquidity purposes‚Äù. They also have the ability to halt trading. 

There were two halts in the day on Friday: First, when GME was up 69% (heh heh), and then a few minutes later when it kept climbing after the first halt was relaxed. Note that at the time of the first halt, the **bid-ask spread was $10 on the underlying** a huge signal that there just were not enough shares to buy.

However, after the second halt, something strange happened. Whereas a few minutes prior, there were no sellers willing to sell their shares below $75, **within 15 minutes** after the halt there were sellers at 70, 65, 60, and 56. Where did these sellers come from? 

&#x200B;

[Incredible momentum reversal on Friday 1\/22 to push the price not too far above the 60c strike price. ](https://preview.redd.it/tt5zodp6pkd61.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa22980543213227bf5b3d17166129ac6cb65a65)

My speculation? This was a coordinated **naked short ladder attack**. In this type of attack, short seller A sells to short seller B, who then turns around to short seller A at a lower price, etc. and with a **very small amount of capital** you can wreck the momentum of a stock and make people think that others are running for the exits.

Notice how the stock dropped from a high of $75 on Friday to below 60 - the highest expiring SP for the 1/22 options, and stayed tight in range for the rest of the day. Now, for compliance reasons, MM are required to be neutral by EOD, so 20 minutes before close, MMs had to buy back all their short positions, which led to the strong close above 60.

All this led me to believe that the **real fair market price for GME was above $65.** Without the market makers interference, GME would have closed higher. 

### A repeat on Monday

The short ladder attack repeated on Monday. 

GME opened strong above $90, and quickly climbed to **a high above $155** before it was halted, immediately after the halt, a **short ladder attack again** drove the price down

[Dejavu - Incredible Momentum Reversal after trading halts. ](https://preview.redd.it/qm81rd0dpkd61.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b4563e7dd2e626fb09dca69668c24631932e707)

Both days, there **were rapid and significant reversals in momentum.** 

Now, I kept wondering - why would MM‚Äôs take the side of the shorts? What‚Äôs in it for them? One theory was that they were not adequately hedged, with the low liquidity of the stock meaning that the price was moving up too fast for them to acquire the shares they needed to. 

But then the news hit today: 

# A new opponent enters the ring:

&#x200B;

That‚Äôs right, the **same Citadel** [**listed by the NYSE as one of their designated market makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) is now invested in Melvin‚Äôs hedge fund and has a financial interest in the direction of GME‚Äôs share price. 

**Hey media - you want a manipulation story? You‚Äôre missing the big one.** 

# Now what? 

Shorts have pulled new dirty tactics each time they‚Äôve been pushed to the edge. Paid media attacks, Citron‚Äôs fluff tweet + coordinated shorting, and now they‚Äôve got the **actual people who get all the order flow on their side.** 

On the other hand, GME is still up over 20% and now trading at $88.00 after hours, which is well above the previous day‚Äôs high. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rr5qet4ipkd61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=96d28bf446a714906712503726f5903a681d5368

What this tells me is that GME‚Äôs **true price is still being suppressed**. They are using every tactic possible, even changing the [bid-ask spread rules](https://thefly.com/permalinks/entry.php/id3233043/GME;IRBT-NYSE-changes-bidask-differentials-on-options-for-GameStop-iRobot) on options to specifically target retail‚Äôs buying of options. 

We‚Äôre now playing the game against the folks who write the rules of the game. 

Some shorts may have covered today - with prices below $60 at one point they had some great opportunities to. However, there is **no way all of the shorts who need to exit covered today.** 

The short position still lost 20% from yesterday. They‚Äôve got more fingers in the dam, but it‚Äôs definitely cracking. Also, **every call option purchased prior to 1/25 is ITM and profitable,** while **every put option purchased prior to 1/25 is OTM.**

And, for some reason, the SEC still doesn‚Äôt want to enforce the threshold securities list for GME, where it‚Äôs now **been on for more than 30 days in a highly covered ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù.**

&#x200B;

# Margin impacts:

Note that at this point, most brokers have increased margin on GME. This means that people that are long or short on margin will need to put up capital to hold their positions. 

This also means **puts will get more expensive** as people who sell puts will have to maintain 100% of the notional in their accounts to secure the put, so MMs will have fewer retail sellers of puts to absorb the demand. 

That means it‚Äôs not a bad idea to sell puts to acquire shares if you‚Äôre aiming for the long-term and not the squeeze, but keep in mind you‚Äôll need the exact same capital as if you‚Äôd bought the shares, so it‚Äôs up to you on this. 

For shorts, a margin increase while the price is moving against you (even with retracements) is no good. 

# My speculation

* Cohen and the GME board have been strangely silent this entire run. It‚Äôs possible they can‚Äôt say anything at all during the pre-earnings quiet period, but I‚Äôm sure they can see what‚Äôs happening. 
* MMs will continue to play dirty, but at the same time they will need to continue to need to buy GME shares to delta hedge 1/29 and later ITM options as we get closer to expiry. 

# Things to be careful about

As you can see, this is no easy win. I've been in GME for a few months but I've seen almost every trick in the book. In addition to the [suggestions I wrote about in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/), here‚Äôs some things to be careful about. 

* **Be careful about swapping ITM calls for OTM calls:** it can be tempting to trade-up your options for higher return, but be mindful of the delta impact. You may actually be driving the sale of shares by MMs when you don‚Äôt mean to. For example, if you sell a .5 delta call for 2 .2 delta calls, that‚Äôs net reduction of 10 shares that MMs have to hold long as leverage. 
* **Be careful about being short any calls this week:** Not only do you limit your upside (which is dumb in the prospect of a squeeze), you could end up in a nightmare scenario. A call that ends OTM on Friday could end up ITM after hours if you didn‚Äôt sell it, and you may get assigned while the underlying continues to go up. 
* **There are a few other dirty tactics shorts can play.** I‚Äôm not specifically going to share them here because I don‚Äôt want to give the ideas circulation, but 
   * **Choose your own limit sells based on personal sell points.** Don‚Äôt copy others and don‚Äôt try to be memey. Make your own decisions. 
   * **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it‚Äôs an **attack vector** for you. 
* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn‚Äôt resume for the rest of the day? **All your 1/29 calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you‚Äôre taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration. 
* **Be careful about buying on margin.** Brokers are rapidly increasing margins. If you bought on margin with 2:1 leverage, and the stock went up 100%, you‚Äôd be in margin call even without a margin change. If the broker moves margin against you, you‚Äôll get to margin call faster. 
* **Don‚Äôt bet more than you can afford to lose.** I‚Äôve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing (remember last Monday with the short sale restriction?), you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I‚Äôve held through multiple 30-40% drawdowns in the underlying; and **held through a 50% drawdown today**, so you need to be ready for the volatility. 
* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It‚Äôs common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you‚Äôve set a stop loss, be really sure about it.

Someone bought around 6000 calls of FUBO 42 strike and then others joined in on the 43 strike. FUBO is a highly shorted stock but one of the main shorts is Kerrisdale Capital, an underperforming fund that is not highly regarded on wall street. Another short seller is Lightshed. Both are probably still in this position even though FUBO actually has long term prospects as a valuable company.

As opposed to Melvin Capital that is somewhat well respected on the street (not sure given how retarded they are for going against WSB), these guys are actually full blown retarded even by wall street standards. They've been underperforming heavily and none of the firms are ever gonna step in to save them. 

I think we'll see a heavy short squeeze because these calls are massive. They bought 6000 calls at around 3 premium so that's around 1.8 million in premium paid.

Now, I know past success is not an indicator of future success, but I have found a company that I believe will be an even better opportunity than GME was in the coming months.

What if I told you that there was a streaming company that is like ROKU before it ran up?

How about a lesser known sports betting company which can run up like DKNG or PENN?

For everyone else, what if there was a company with insane short interest like GME, which unlike GME, has not even begun to squeeze?

  
**What if these were all the same company, ready to run up massively?**

  
This company is FUBO, or fuboTV. Let‚Äôs go over the reasons why.

&#x200B;

**1: Cutting the Cable**

More than 60% of people in the US still have a cable subscription. Why don‚Äôt people just use Netflix, Amazon Video, or something like that? The answer is that they want live TV. This created a demand for streaming services such as Youtube TV, which are cheaper and better than cable. Among these, fuboTV has the distinction of providing the best channel/price ratio, 113 channels for $65 a month. Don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good price? Well, their customers do, at least. FuboTV‚Äôs paid subscriber count, revenue per user, and hours watched increased dramatically in Q3, by 58%, 14%, and 83% respectively. Total revenue rose by 71% that quarter. In addition, Fubo just increased their Q4 guidance, saying they expect $94-98 million in revenue this quarter instead of the prior $80-85 million. They also expect paid subscribers to reach 545,000 at the end of the year, instead of the prior guidance of 500k-510k. Also, they expect to increase the amount of money they make from advertising.

**2: Sports Betting Fever**

Sports betting is becoming legal in more states than ever before, and the industry is projected to reach $155 billion by 2024. Companies like DKNG and PENN have already capitalized on this growth, and FUBO also wants in. FuboTV is no stranger to sports: they started out as a company mainly focused on sports streaming, and they cover many sports games that other services miss out on. FuboTV recently completed two acquisitions of sports betting companies, Balto Sports and Vigtory. They plan to create an integrated sports betting environment where their sports fans can watch games live and bet on them. Through Vigtory, they already have a deal for legal sports betting in Iowa and are in talks with other Eastern U.S. states to begin operations there.

**3: Actual GOOD Analyst Coverage and Price Targets**

Now, I know what you‚Äôre thinking. Analysts are monkeys that set arbitrary targets for stocks and often make worse recommendations than if you just picked stocks randomly. However, some have results that speak for themselves. FUBO was recommended by Luke Lango, the #1 financial blogger on TipRanks. He has an average success rate of 84%, or 420/499 stock ratings, and an average return of 60.3% per rating. Compared to the average analysts which boomers call ‚Äúgood‚Äù getting an average success rate of \~60%, this man is a genius. Luke thinks FUBO can tap into the live TV market and grow by 2000% over the next 10 years, or about 35% each year. But whether you believe in his recommendation or not, boomers love price targets and worship analysts. When they see the stock hitting the price target, they will get on board. And the analyst consensus price for FUBO right now is 43.50. Just above where we are today.

**4: SHORT SQUEEZE!!! üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

For all of you who can barely read and are just looking for the next GME, this is the place for you. If somehow you can tell what this is saying, FUBO last checked in with a short interest of 65% as of December 31. Two üåàüêª firms decided to short the stock and spread FUD about them not being able to make profit or succeed in sports betting, advertising, or subscription revenue when they saw it had run up. Well guess what, they are already showing growth in subscribing user growth, completing sports betting acquisitions, and the rest is soon to follow. FUBO is way down from the high of $60 and is just looking to run with a positive catalyst. FUBO üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

**Positions: FUBO $50C 3/5, $50C 5/21.**

(before reading, note that they are reporting earnings on the morning of the 26th, I will be taking advantage of the IV crush to open a LEAP position)

To start, I see an awful amount of praise for ETF's when playing this sector. However, while ETF's offer greater security in individual investments, the true risk and reward of playing this sector becomes apparent through the lens of comparison. The three ETF's I concentrated on for this DD are:

* **ICLN**
* **TAN**
* **FAN**

While these are all popular, none of them have weighted NEE anywhere near its capitalization potential. Just the next two years alone will nearly certainly double the stock's market cap. They have over $50B in infrastructure investments planned through 2022, and you can be assured that they will have an advantage to this [in the form of tax credits and subsidies.](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/nee-stock-is-ready-to-soar-under-green-biden-administration/)

That's right, Uncle Sam is going to skullfuck this company with tax credits and subsidies to the point that this thing could have a TSLA-esque potential. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, how does this company look when lined up among some competition?

The particular interest with NEE is that they seemingly do it all. This shit is like the Chic-Fil-A of the energy sector. It could honestly not give less of a shit about saving the world, its only focus is cash flow, which in terms that WSB is accustomed to, is just fuel reserves for its inevitable moon mission. I analyzed 3 different companies in the renewable energy sector, and those were

1. Plug Power
   1. slowing of net income in Q/Q growth.
2. Enphase
   1. already boomed. the party for this one got busted pretty fast. imo just a shitty boomer pick
3. First Solar
   1. This one is a legitimate competitor in my view. 
   2. I would honestly invest in this if its revenue sources were more diverse.

So taking these into account, NEE seems as if its obligatory duty is to take the throne of the renewable market (if you're for some reason doubting it even slightly)

# TLDR: EZ CASHFLOW, ECO-CONSCIOUS, and *bigly* expansion with tax credits incoming to help assist.

*ignore the +100%. f¬¥ing boomers sold this shit in premarket.*

# TLDR:

Company established a groundbreaking drug, Voclosporin. It has many benefits (more efficent, orally given, less side affects). They have the patent until 2037(!). The company expects 65K$ per patient - at least 200K patients in the US \* how many are actually treated = 1.3B $. They have 400M $ cash on hand + an aggreement for licensing the drug in Japan + EU for 100M $ + various milestone payments + 10-20% of revenue.

In total:

1.8B $ alone for the first year in the US, 1.3B $ is recurring revenue + 10-20% of revenue once EU/Japan approve the drug. Market cap? Only 2.3B $ Buyout? CEO and Chairman are open for it + have created comps which were bought out in the past by major pharm players.

# Establishing Voclosporin

SLE ( Systemic Lupus Ery. ) is an autoimmune disease. Various stages, various form. One of the worst is Lupus Nephrithis. In this form the functional units of the kidney, the nephrons, are attack by the bodies own immune system. The functions of the kidney fall off a cliff. Untreated the diagnosis is death.

[pretty shit to suffer from this](https://preview.redd.it/fgxut51hfmd61.png?width=1595&format=png&auto=webp&s=34e84cdf5ae2653cb1053711f60794d68bded1fe)

Current SoC / standard of care is the major use of steroids and using drugs to depress the immunesystem. This SoC is pretty shit as it is suboptimal and only helps few ppl improve. The target according to guidelines is:

*TLDR: decrease the secretion of protein*

Enter Voclosporin / Le blockbuster

It is a member of the Cyclosporin fam - so called calcineurin inhibitors. As I had to suffer through human physiology in this semster: they inhibite this molecule which turns on various immunological pathways.

With Voclosporin they are faster (only need 50% of the time), better, can be used on more classes of LN, can cut down on steroids and all it takes is a pill.

They have been prepared for the liftoff. They boost a variety of people to influence all parameters of the equation: physicians, patients and insurance

# Tendies

The company owns the IP until 2037. This is incredibly bullish. Only one competitor exists: Benelysta by GSK (actually GSK bought the comp and did not develop it themself). They are inferior in every aspect + it¬¥s not an orally given pill but and injection - yikes.

The *CEO was kinda retetarded* during the webcast yesterday. Well he had to be. So this part is a bit hard.

As LN is a rare disease the number of ppl affected is only roughly known. Therefore yesterday was kinda shit with the analysts as they were expecting a precise number on the revenue. The CEO was only able to provide the lower bound on the revenue.

https://preview.redd.it/brsuo5yrmmd61.png?width=1586&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cc001092a8a0c5e773f683b42169b4eeabe3503

AUPH provides patients with the pills package - called a wallet. This wallet contains around 60 pills. The patient takes 6 pills daily - i.e. this package lasts 10 days. Now here I¬¥m a bit retarded BUT the CEO said they price the wallet to be 65K $ meaning a patient will receive the drug for 30 days will net the comp around 3x 65K. However the slides say 65K $ so I¬¥ll leave it at that. => 65K $ per patient

Now, conservative estimates for the number of ppl suffering from LN is 200K - 300K. In my TLDR section I already did some math to figure out that the combination of those low estimates yields around 1.3B $ in revenue. 65K \* 200K \* actually treated patients = 1.3B

Add the 400M $ cash on hand + the licensing agreements and we have around 1.9B $ while the market cap is only 2.3B $. Once the real numbers and not just the low estimates are starting to pile up they will improve the share price.

This disease affects women and people from ""minority populations"" more often. These groups are the prime target of political actions taken by the progressive politicans.

Having this disease be common in those populations the real number of patients to be treated may be higher. On a humanitarian note, ""minority populations"" suffering from a disease and society not giving a damn is pretty bad."|2021-01-26 13:30:25.666589|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_133025.csv|StockTicker|['A', 'GME']|['A', 'GME']|['TLDR', '$AUPH', 'I', 'DD', 'K', 'US', 'B', 'M', 'EU', 'M', 'B', 'US', 'B', 'B', 'CEO', 'D', 'ST', 'W', 'DD', 'SLE', 'C', 'C', 'I', 'LN', 'IP', 'GSK', 'GSK', 'CEO', 'LN', 'CEO', 'AUPH', 'BUT', 'CEO', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'LN', 'K', 'K', 'TLDR', 'I', 'B', 'K', 'K', 'B', 'M', 'B', 'B']|['AUPH', 'I', 'DD', 'K', 'B', 'M', 'M', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'CEO', 'D', 'ST', 'W', 'DD', 'C', 'C', 'I', 'IP', 'GSK', 'GSK', 'CEO', 'CEO', 'AUPH', 'CEO', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'I', 'B', 'K', 'K', 'B', 'M', 'B', 'B']

I think this is going to get a bunch of downvotes because it's not bullish. But someone else recently posted on here that they werent seeing two-sided conversations anymore and it seemed as though there were at least some people who upvoted him. I have enjoyed the actual DD posts I've found on here and thought that this was a good read so I thought I would pass along.

I emailed one of my best friends who runs software for his HF and asked what he thought about BB / whether I should hold onto my shares. I edited / redacted some lines to help protect his identity, and bolded a few for emphasis. His fund was up almost 100% last year and as you'll see in his comments, they were / are long a number of other WSB stocks, which I thought definitely added some credibility.

Anyways, take it for whatever it's worth, but thought I'd pass along. I am going to sell my BB shares at open and buy more GME + the other names he recommended to me, which I'm going to start doing some reading on.

\-----------

Hey man, you should take whatever I say with a grain of salt as nothing I say should be considered investment advice. But to give you a sense, **our biggest winners last year as a fund were TSLA, CRWD, and two companies who sell vertical software into the auto ecosystem (so I'd say we know both the security and auto tech space very well). We also currently own GME shares, which I think this still have room to run.**

**But from my vantage point, the BB move does not reflect fundamentals and the fair value of that stock is materially lower, ie. somewhere in the $7 range, and most likely lower.**

Yes, BB is a cyber security company now, not a mobile phone company. But that's nothing new. You can think of the company as having 3 parts: (1) non auto security (endpoint management + endpoint security), (2) QNX (autos), and (3) IP licensing.

**(1) Non-auto security:** UEM (unified endpoint management) and endpoint security (Cylance, what competes with CRWD). These businesses are getting absolutely smoked. This year was the first year that BB did not appear in the top right Gartner quartile, and MSFT has been eating their lunch bc their offering (InTune) is basically free. Churn in this segment is probably \~20% / year, and has been declining in revenue for multiple years now. Meanwhile, endpoint (Cyclance) has been a disaster. This last year, while the big endpoint companies (Crowdstrike, Carbon Black, Sentinel One) grew close to 100%, Cylance was flat / slightly down y/y (during the biggest endpoint boom in history). Everyone from that team left post acquisition ([https://www.crn.com/news/security/cylance-founder-ceo-stuart-mcclure-exits-months-after-blackberry-deal?itc=refresh](https://www.crn.com/news/security/cylance-founder-ceo-stuart-mcclure-exits-months-after-blackberry-deal?itc=refresh)) and they are falling way behind competitors. This blended segment is going to continue to fall in revenue y/y.

**(2) QNX:** this is probably the best situated segment on a relative basis, but still struggling. The hype around the AWS announcement is way overblown. QNX is not going to be on 100% of cars because of this. MSFT and GOOG both have auto OEM offerings that do the same thing. There is no way AWS is going to get 100% market share, because no one ever gets 100% market share in anything. And in particular, auto OEMs are never going to want a single supplier to have 100% market share, their entire supply chain is built around ensuring that doesnt happen. The only reason AWS partnered with them is because they needed someone who already sold to auto OEM's to get their foot in the door. GOOG already has auto relationships from Android Automotive, while MSFT has a number of auto partners already signed on to their platform ([https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-connected-vehicle-platform-trends-and-investment-areas/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-connected-vehicle-platform-trends-and-investment-areas/)). So this lets AMZN cross-sell with someone and gives BB a reason to choose them. Right now BB has about 30% market share of cars that on the road. Even if that doubles in 6 years, you'd only be up to $8-$10 in value, because as they add ADAS customers, they are losing all their infotainment customers that make up current base. Also, AMZN is not going to ""share"" any of the recurring revenue with BB. BB has said they ""hope"" to cross sell their own new services as part of IVY, and when we talk to auto customers about this they laugh at the idea that they'd rather buy those services from BB over AMZN. Finally, QNX will not ""be needed on every single EV"" as some people claim. I think the bigger market there is rather than have the security built into a proprietary OS like QNX, you'll see cars start to include endpoint agents themselves (ie. from Crowdstrike or Sentinel One). CRWD is piloting this program today with a few OEMs.

**(3) IP Licensing:** this is effectively their mobile division that has transitioned from being in house to sold to 3P's. Mgmt has said this is going to be flat on a forward basis and will start declining in a few years (avg patent life of 10 yrs, no new R&D). If you assume this is currently a 90% gross margin business, then IP currently makes up 100% of the firms profits (software is not yet profitable).

Two final notes - BB's business does not generate ""recurring"" revenue. This is pretty easy to tell bc every quarter, the ""recurring"" ARR goes down, and quarterly revenue is not = at least 25% of the disclosed recurring revenue amount. Also, this is no longer a company at the cutting edge of technology, despite what people are saying. Again, easy way to tell this is that R&D has been falling every quarter since they made the Cylance acquisition two years ago. How many co's do you know that are investing for the cloud / new products that are spending less on R&D every quarter?

**So at the end of the day, you have a software business that has declining revenue and is not yet profitable, an auto product that is losing share on its legacy infotainment business, and an IP business that is going to fall off a cliff in a couple of years. Aggregate revenue is going to be rising low single digits and EBITDA growth after next year will be flat.**

In terms of valuation, dont forget to dilute the share count by 60mm shares for the convert they just issued last quarter. **If you give the company a generous 20x fwd EBITDA on out year bullish numbers the upside case is $10/sh, while the base case is more like $5-7.**

**If you really believed the upside case, then I could see rationale for buying at $6 to play for the $10 of upside.** That's fair. But The idea that this is a $100bn or even $20bn mkt cap is ludicrous. We arent short the name, but I would strongly advise you not to put a significant portion of your money in the stock. It very well may go up bc there's no telling how high stocks on these momentum moves can go, but at some point you have to be the one holding the stock and I dont want it to be you. Stock's can only maintain their value in the multi-billion valuation range at the end of these runs if there is institutional demand to buy the next share (which is what happened in TSLA), and I dont think that exists for BB north of $10.

**I think there are much better things to put your money into.** We still own **GME** (which I know is a a favorite among your friends), which I think has a much better setup. If you want security software exposure, I would tell you we're bullish on **PANW, CRWD, and ZS**. If you want auto tech exposure, I'd say you should look at **LPRO**, which recently SPAC'd and isn't yet followed / understood by the street. A couple other random longs I like right now are **BABA** and **PENN**.

Feel free to lmk if you have any follow up questions. Glad to see you're focused on the fundamentals."|2021-01-26 13:30:25.666589|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_133025.csv|StockTicker|['$BB', 'DD']|['DD']|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'BB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'HF', 'BB', 'I', 'I', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'BB', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'TSLA', 'CRWD', 'GME', 'I', 'BB', 'BB', 'QNX', 'IP', 'UEM', 'BB', 'MSFT', 'AWS', 'QNX', 'MSFT', 'GOOG', 'OEM', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'GOOG', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'BB', 'BB', 'ADAS', 'AMZN', 'BB', 'BB', 'IVY', 'BB', 'AMZN', 'QNX', 'I', 'OS', 'QNX', 'CRWD', 'IP', 'IP', 'ARR', 'D', 'D', 'IP', 'BITDA', 'BITDA', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'BB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'PANW', 'CRWD', 'A', 'I']|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'HF', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'TSLA', 'GME', 'I', 'IP', 'MSFT', 'MSFT', 'GOOG', 'GOOG', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'AMZN', 'AMZN', 'I', 'IP', 'IP', 'ARR', 'D', 'D', 'IP', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'PANW', 'A', 'I']
