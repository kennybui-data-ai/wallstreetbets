While I hope you all make tons of money today, remember that is important to also give back. As a commitment to this I pledge that if PLTR reaches $40 by the end of the week, I will donate $500 and upload proof (obviously). I'm not rich (yet), or I would happily donate more. I hope you guys enjoy your day and make lots of tendies.

Thank you,

On the eve of this great day, I think it's important to say that it's always best to understate/undersell your winnings to friends and family. I, for instance, will only tell when asked, and then give a figure around 50/60% of the real figure.


**There are a multitude of reasons for doing this:**

1. People do not understand the hard work and risk you have taken for these gains, and so will expect them for free

2. Manipulative people will come out of the woodwork

3. You may have taxes yet to pay (I know it sucks)

4. You may lose all of this money yet (I am taking an investing break after this insane ride) 

5. The money is not a running tap, and is lump sums, so don't build a lifestyle around it 

6. Money is so much easier to spend than to make, please be sensible

That's all I have to say. Have a quiet cigar or champagne when you do cash out (above $1000 of course), or come up with some other excuse as to where the money came from.

On the eve of this lamentous day, I think it's important to say that it's always best to overstate/oversell your winnings to friends and family, I, for instance, always tell without asking, and then give a figure around 50/60% of the real figure after reversing the signs.

**There are a multitude of reasons for doing this:**

* People will otherwise, understand the little work and effort you have taken to lose your entire savings, bosses will expect you to start working wage-free

* You will need to go back into hiding from friends and family whom you've also ruined

* Can't pay taxes when you're dead (that's a plus)

* You can still gain it back buying the dip (I am taking out a loan on my wife's house and ring and going on an investment binge after boyfriend finishes her insane ride)

* The money was a running tap and your dumb ass blew it.

* Money is so much easier to make than spend so please be stoic

That's all I have to say. Have a quiet cry and jerk when you do cash out (below -$1000 of course), or come up with some other tale about how you totally sold at a vastly more opportune time than you really did.

Now, I know past success is not an indicator of future success, but I have found a company that I believe will be an even better opportunity than GME was in the coming months.

What if I told you that there was a streaming company that is like ROKU before it ran up?

How about a lesser known sports betting company which can run up like DKNG or PENN?

For everyone else, what if there was a company with insane short interest like GME, which unlike GME, has not even begun to squeeze?

  
**What if these were all the same company, ready to run up massively?**

  
This company is FUBO, or fuboTV. Let‚Äôs go over the reasons why.

&#x200B;

**1: Cutting the Cable**

More than 60% of people in the US still have a cable subscription. Why don‚Äôt people just use Netflix, Amazon Video, or something like that? The answer is that they want live TV. This created a demand for streaming services such as Youtube TV, which are cheaper and better than cable. Among these, fuboTV has the distinction of providing the best channel/price ratio, 113 channels for $65 a month. Don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good price? Well, their customers do, at least. FuboTV‚Äôs paid subscriber count, revenue per user, and hours watched increased dramatically in Q3, by 58%, 14%, and 83% respectively. Total revenue rose by 71% that quarter. In addition, Fubo just increased their Q4 guidance, saying they expect $94-98 million in revenue this quarter instead of the prior $80-85 million. They also expect paid subscribers to reach 545,000 at the end of the year, instead of the prior guidance of 500k-510k. Also, they expect to increase the amount of money they make from advertising.

**2: Sports Betting Fever**

Sports betting is becoming legal in more states than ever before, and the industry is projected to reach $155 billion by 2024. Companies like DKNG and PENN have already capitalized on this growth, and FUBO also wants in. FuboTV is no stranger to sports: they started out as a company mainly focused on sports streaming, and they cover many sports games that other services miss out on. FuboTV recently completed two acquisitions of sports betting companies, Balto Sports and Vigtory. They plan to create an integrated sports betting environment where their sports fans can watch games live and bet on them. Through Vigtory, they already have a deal for legal sports betting in Iowa and are in talks with other Eastern U.S. states to begin operations there.

**3: Actual GOOD Analyst Coverage and Price Targets**

Now, I know what you‚Äôre thinking. Analysts are monkeys that set arbitrary targets for stocks and often make worse recommendations than if you just picked stocks randomly. However, some have results that speak for themselves. FUBO was recommended by Luke Lango, the #1 financial blogger on TipRanks. He has an average success rate of 84%, or 420/499 stock ratings, and an average return of 60.3% per rating. Compared to the average analysts which boomers call ‚Äúgood‚Äù getting an average success rate of \~60%, this man is a genius. Luke thinks FUBO can tap into the live TV market and grow by 2000% over the next 10 years, or about 35% each year. But whether you believe in his recommendation or not, boomers love price targets and worship analysts. When they see the stock hitting the price target, they will get on board. And the analyst consensus price for FUBO right now is 43.50. Just above where we are today.

**4: SHORT SQUEEZE!!! üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

For all of you who can barely read and are just looking for the next GME, this is the place for you. If somehow you can tell what this is saying, FUBO last checked in with a short interest of 65% as of December 31. Two üåàüêª firms decided to short the stock and spread FUD about them not being able to make profit or succeed in sports betting, advertising, or subscription revenue when they saw it had run up. Well guess what, they are already showing growth in subscribing user growth, completing sports betting acquisitions, and the rest is soon to follow. FUBO is way down from the high of $60 and is just looking to run with a positive catalyst. FUBO üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

**Positions: FUBO $50C 3/5, $50C 5/21.**

Why can't Melvin capital just uninstall the Robinhood app and reinstall it to restore their save game and get their money back?????

Reading between the lines, I think Melvin got a margin call that would have wiped out the hedge fund. That would have caused Citadel and Point72 to have a portion of their portion go to $0 which would have hurt their returns. They decided to pump more money into it to prevent bankruptcy. 

Sounds like these hedge funds are vultures coming in to feast on the carcass.

Who is going to bailout Citadel and Point72 when they get squeezed too?

**Citadel LLC and Point72 Asset Management are investing $2.75 billion into hedge fund Melvin Capital Management, which has been hard hit by a series of short bets to start the year.**

The influx of cash is expected to help stabilize Melvin, which has lost 30% for the year through Friday, said people familiar with the firm. Melvin started the year with $12.5 billion and had been one of the best performing hedge funds on Wall Street in recent years. The losses stem from Melvin‚Äôs array of short-bets against companies and have stunned clients and other traders.

Citadel and its partners are investing $2 billion and Point72, which already had more than $1 billion invested in Melvin as of 2019, $750 million. The investments are for non-controlling revenue shares in the hedge fund. Melvin founder Gabe Plotkin was a top portfolio manager at Point72‚Äôs predecessor firm, SAC Capital Management before he left to start Melvin.


It couldn‚Äôt be determined how much of a revenue share Citadel and Point72 would get.

Shorts recognize that we're almost all into our positions now. The outstanding float that isn't held by us is in their possession minus a few defectors on our side and 5-10% held by others. They are going to do EVERYTHING in their power to bring this down. ""Like what?"" you may ask...

1. Bot brigade negative sentiment on social media, reddit, etc. (this has yet to be common and could be more prevalent soon - though I have seen some new made accounts posting negative sentiment on GME)

1. Buying up the shares we don't have, driving up the price... 

 a) Hoping to create more liquidity for them by reducing our shares (more defectors as price goes up). 

 b) So they can accumulate shares and manufacture large sell offs on volume to create what we saw earlier today

1. Persuade investors on reddit, social media, etc. that there are other better things to buy that will fuck shorts. Yes, there are plenty. But they want to spread us thin. BB, AMC, etc. are just the beginning. If we sell some of our shares to allocate to these and more that will be mentioned over the next couple weeks, we will lose. We will lose not only our strength in GME, but our strength in any focus of any short squeeze.

This is a war. We won the first battle and now they know we mean business. But we haven't won the war. They are going to pull shit that we won't see coming. We will be tested and this will not be easy. But we need to understand that if we persevere through this, we will not only come out rich for our early endeavors (because it's still early in this squeeze) but we will have power in bringing about actual change in the way large funds manipulate prices and how they manage risk. It sounds cliche, but this literally is the turning point. This is where we make history.

From the dizzying highs to soul-crushing lows. I even bought a bit more at the midpoint prices of today. From my observations, this is how the institutions conspired to crush the longs in order to give the shorts breathing room to cover.

1. The beginning of the day was intentional. They let fomo run GME all the way into the sky with almost no resistance whatsoever.

2. However, at around 10-10:30 AM EST, something odd happened. The brokers suddenly jacked up their margin requirements for GME. My portfolio previously had a lot of buying power, which suddenly disappeared.

3. We were intentionally allowed to break 150 (which is the highest option strike available) in order to make everyone fomo even harder. Then, the dump came, and it was vicious. At the same time, CNBC started an hour-long segment bashing GME nonstop. Only Cramer provided a bit of token resistance. Every other analyst was calling this move unwarranted and warning that tons of people will be bagholding.

4. As a result, everyone who chased in on margin got fucked. Even my sizeable portfolio was margin called. Fortunately, while I'm retarded, I'm not the most retarded and was not all in GME and was using only a little margin. I was able to cover easily. The unfortunate morons who fomo'd in on margin above today's open were not so lucky. I imagine a lot of retards got liquidated on the way down.

5. The cascading effect let us fill the gap completely and even a little past. However, the important point is that we closed above Friday's close at +18% for the day. I see this as very bullish. So keep holding and don't fucking sell into the fear the other side tried to create. Going forward, stop buying GME on heavy margin. Use cash accounts if possible. Don't let yourself be set up as a domino piece for the shorts to knock over into everyone else.

**TLDR: MMers, brokers, and shorts conspired to screw us. They let us run price up, then jacked up margin requirements, and finally dumped. Despite that, we defended Friday's close quite well so DON'T FUCKING SELL.**"|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093238.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'GME', 'AM', 'EST', 'GME', 'CNBC', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'T', 'CKING', 'SELL']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

We all know the story of $GME and the very real possibility of a substantial short squeeze, the likes of which we have never seen before.  Predictably, retail investors, with a laser focus on /r/WSB, are taking the blame.  CNBC can‚Äôt stop talking about how /r/WSB is ‚Äúcausing‚Äù the short squeeze, trying to characterize a community of random, anonymous, degenerate primates with a legally cognizable entity that can be regulated.  The narrative so far has been that the short squeeze in $GME will cause market-wide sell offs, as we saw this morning when the stock price hit $150.  (They want you to ignore that the market recovered and $GME went from red to up ~20% into close without negative impact to the market at large.)

The facts here are clear.  Shorting GME has been free money for awhile now, but the shorts got greedy and got caught with their pants down.  It is unquestionable that if someone is to ‚Äúblame‚Äù for the short squeeze, should it occur, the blame is solely on the shorts for putting themselves in such an incredibly risky position‚Äîafter all, don‚Äôt they say to ‚Äúinvest at your own risk‚Äù?  Also, no one here in WSB is rich enough to be buying $GME at $100 per share in the thousands.  The other hedge funds smell blood in the water and are eliminating their competition. 

It is also clear that the shorts are bleeding. (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4wh03/we_fucking_did_it_bois/)  

They are going to get desperate. It seems likely that they will infiltrate our freedom of speech haven in order to spread misinformation about $GME. 

First, in the beginning I was concerned about the risk of the company doing an offering and diluting ownership.  However, as I looked into it more, I discovered that even if $GME does an offering, it would be limited to $100M, which is miniscule in relation to GME‚Äôs fair market cap. (See, e.g., https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4coy2/how_likely_is_a_gme_offering/). In other words, if you see headlines or posts talking about a GME offering, they can be ignored as inconsequential.
Second, if you did your research, you will find a bullish PT of $169 as set by GMEDD.com et al. (see https://www.gmedd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GMEdd-GameStopValuation-20Jan21.pdf)   However, you need to bear in mind that the same report set a base PT of $80, which is where we are right about now.  The shorts aren‚Äôt donkey brained, so they will send their peons to infiltrate /r/WSB to try convince people that the ‚Äúbig dogs‚Äù in the GME short play are getting out at this price target and that you will end up being the bag holder.  **THIS IS ALL BULLSHIT THAT SHOULD BE IGNORED** Although I respect the team at gmedd, we all know that a conservative bullish price target is $420.69, and no one with half a brain should consider selling any sooner.

This is not the first time I've had >50K YOLOS and gain/loss porn removed.  
I believe my posts are the epitome of what WSBers are looking for.  
FD YOLOs, GAIN/LOSS, DD (most of my solid DD has been removed).  
My posts are also all legitimate with clear images of my position and cost basis.

Messaging the mods only yields sarcastic dumbass remarks.  
It's ironic how the mods act like they're trying to protect the sub, yet they're manipulating their own stocks by allowing/disallowing posts at will.

The mods embody the very things we retailers are fighting against.  
Now, they're no better than Citron Research.

I've said this before and I'll say it again.  
The spirit of this sub is getting killed.

The mods are self serving pieces of shit and I caution any of you members to realize what is going on and act accordingly.

I'm sure this post will either get removed, or some dumbass mod will count how many posts have been removed on just this user name and try to call me out as overtly sensitive for only a few posts.  
This has been going one for a while, although not to the same extent or degree as of late.

Either way, It's been fun everyone; take care and good luck.  
Don't let these jackasses pull the rug out from under your feet.

EDIT, there seems to be a lot of retards with zero reading comprehension.  
Here's a response from ZJZ the last time I inquired about a large yolo post getting removed.

https://preview.redd.it/982au9eqjkd61.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cadf269d0a2f9795ab00e6125fc37a6f482096

The other mod ( I can't find the message or remember his name) simply told me my ticker was gay (another near 6 figure FD YOLO).

As you can see, this was 5 months ago and it has been going on for a while.  
Keep sucking off the mods you bottom feeding donkeys, you deserve to be here and lose your money.  


EDIT 2, I literally posted another YOLO under this username 3 days ago. Once again, zjz claims his lies and the sheeple believe everything he says.  
He likes to deflect and blame it on something else, such as the case of auto mod the last time someone called him out.

I'm just a dumbass with some life experience to share.

**First, buy some goddamn personal umbrella insurance.** It's cheap af, like I pay $400 a year for mine. And it's easy af to buy. What is umbrella insurance? It's something poor people will never have to worry about, so be glad it's in your life now. **It protects you from lawsuits by parasites by adding million(s) of dollars in personal liability coverage above and beyond the policy limits of your auto, renters or homeowners insurance.**

Your shitty auto/renter/homeowners policies have limits of a couple hundred thousand bucks max. If you hit somebody's car, if someone slips and falls in your house, if someone accuses you of sexual assault, odds are there they will want to sue you. Any plaintiff's attorney worth half a fuck that they hire is going to do their research on you and when they do their DD and find out you have tons of assets now, they are going to come after way more than what they wanted thinking you were just some broke nobody. Umbrella insurance protects you from the unlikely but ever present threat of bankruptcy through lawsuits now that you are rich target. I've seen way too many idiot doctors and successful small business owners lose their life's work through negligence lawsuits and not having umbrella policies in place that would have stopped it.

Which brings me to my second request of you. Don't make yourself an obvious target. **Keep your goddamn mouth shut about your tendies and tell no one the particulars. Don't even fucking hint at it.** Don't tell dad to make him proud, don't tell strangers to impress them and feel good, don't tell some girl to get her to fuck you. I don't care if you shower the people you love with gifts, it's none of my business. If they ask, just say you had a good year trading and leave it at that.

Neither of my parents know about my trading profits, nor that I'm a millionaire. None of my friends know. I'll go to my grave not telling a soul. Because I see how people treat the people I know IRL who do flaunt it and I'm disgusted how some people (not all) no longer view you as a person, just something to exploit. 

**Why tf should you listen to me? Maybe you shouldn't. I was wrong af about GME.** I posted how I thought it was trash from $10 to $30 and while I thought u/DeepFuckingValue deserved props for eating shit all year and holding strong, I thought the rest of you were FOMO sheep chasing it in the $20s. Mea culpa. I'm glad I was wrong. I've never seen so many rattled old white men before in my life before this week and it's great. I'm genuinely happy for you guys that hit it big and hope the squeeze isn't over. Please consider what I've said.

# Previous Important Posts

* [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) (DTC Infinity) covered the short positions, the float, and potential snowball impacts of increasing prices, and argued that part of the reason that shorts haven‚Äôt closed was that it was pretty much impossible for shorts to close
* [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) covered Cohen, fair market cap analysis, and potential investors, in which I talked about the amazing mid-to-long term potential for GME.
* After the Citron tweet, I shared this [fan fiction on what looked like blatant market manipulation by shorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) on the day of the tweet, and offered some education on strengthening your position. This one got buried and is worth reading.

# What‚Äôs happened thus far

## Why did GME go up on Friday?

The story here is more complex than paid media articles would like you to believe. GME has been driven up by 3 different forces:

* Organic buying
   * There is a mixture of growing positive sentiment in the investor world (not just WSB) about GME‚Äôs future
   * There‚Äôs been a lot of good due diligence shared not just on WSB but even outside (for example, see gmedd.com)
   * The Citron Backfire
      * Shorts were on the ropes and kept looking for hail mary‚Äôs. They went to Citron and [coordinated a dump](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) to try to bring the price down.
      * However, this backfired. Citron is so disliked in the industry that new wealth poured into GME in the face of Andrew Left‚Äôs pleas. Even when Benzinga brought Andrew Left on air, **minutes after he left** [they bought shares live on their show](https://youtu.be/mFiFWBrE5DE?t=5104)**.**
      * The next day, our very on u/Uberkikz11 [was on Benzinga](https://youtu.be/GLzTU87MJMM?t=837) and more shares were bought.
   * Larger investors piling in
      * In my [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/), I hypothesized that we‚Äôd soon see larger investors pile in. Then, on WSB, we saw posts from a [venture capitalist](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/) as well as a [hedge fund investor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/)
* Gamma squeeze
   * Once the organic buying started, we rolled into a gamma squeeze. Many people written about the gamma squeeze so I won‚Äôt repeat, see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/) for an example.
* Ultra low liquidity - In EndGame part 1, I talked about how the actual actively traded shares are much lower than the reported float, and **share availability has been reducing** driven by lots of diamond hands, not just among smaller guys like us but the larger folks too.
* I believe there were some short covers on Friday, but Ortex was still estimating 71M shares short at the eod.

However, not many people have talked about why it **went down**

## Why did GME come down?

Here‚Äôs where things got interesting for me, and something I think happened again today (Monday) when GME climbed up over 100% but then had a rapid reversal, closing 20% above yesterday but closing below open.

So Friday looked like a slam dunk - gamma squeeze, no shorts available to short, puts were getting exceedingly expensive as a short tactic. What happened?

This is my fan fiction, based on what I saw.

**I believe** [**market-makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) **took a non-neutral stance and began actively shorting the stock after the second halt.**

Market-makers are responsible for maintaining liquidity and functioning in the stock market, but they also have abilities that others don‚Äôt - for example they are legally allowed to naked short for ‚Äúliquidity purposes‚Äù. They also have the ability to halt trading.

There were two halts in the day on Friday: First, when GME was up 69% (heh heh), and then a few minutes later when it kept climbing after the first halt was relaxed. Note that at the time of the first halt, the **bid-ask spread was $10 on the underlying** a huge signal that there just were not enough shares to buy.

However, after the second halt, something strange happened. Whereas a few minutes prior, there were no sellers willing to sell their shares below $75, **within 15 minutes** after the halt there were sellers at 70, 65, 60, and 56. Where did these sellers come from?

&#x200B;

[Incredible momentum reversal on Friday 1\/22 to push the price not too far above the 60c strike price. ](https://preview.redd.it/tt5zodp6pkd61.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa22980543213227bf5b3d17166129ac6cb65a65)

My speculation? This was a coordinated **naked short ladder attack**. In this type of attack, short seller A sells to short seller B, who then turns around to short seller A at a lower price, etc. and with a **very small amount of capital** you can wreck the momentum of a stock and make people think that others are running for the exits.

Notice how the stock dropped from a high of $75 on Friday to below 60 - the highest expiring SP for the 1/22 options, and stayed tight in range for the rest of the day. Now, for compliance reasons, MM are required to be neutral by EOD, so 20 minutes before close, MMs had to buy back all their short positions, which led to the strong close above 60.

All this led me to believe that the **real fair market price for GME was above $65.** Without the market makers interference, GME would have closed higher.

## A repeat on Monday

The short ladder attack repeated on Monday.

GME opened strong above $90, and quickly climbed to **a high above $155** before it was halted, immediately after the halt, a **short ladder attack again** drove the price down

&#x200B;

[Dejavu - Incredible Momentum Reversal after trading halts. ](https://preview.redd.it/qm81rd0dpkd61.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b4563e7dd2e626fb09dca69668c24631932e707)

Both days, there **were rapid and significant reversals in momentum.**

Now, I kept wondering - why would MM‚Äôs take the side of the shorts? What‚Äôs in it for them? One theory was that they were not adequately hedged, with the low liquidity of the stock meaning that the price was moving up too fast for them to acquire the shares they needed to.

But then the news hit today:

# A new opponent enters the ring:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8htb0scgpkd61.png?width=926&format=png&auto=webp&s=228a8a84e592ea4642a61c5e07e07ae344ac8f2c

That‚Äôs right, the **same Citadel** [**listed by the NYSE as one of their designated market makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) is now invested in Melvin‚Äôs hedge fund and has a financial interest in the direction of GME‚Äôs share price.

**Hey media - you want a manipulation story? You‚Äôre missing the big one.**

# Now what?

Shorts have pulled new dirty tactics each time they‚Äôve been pushed to the edge. Paid media attacks, Citron‚Äôs fluff tweet + coordinated shorting, and now they‚Äôve got the **actual people who get all the order flow on their side.**

On the other hand, GME is still up over 20% and now trading at $88.00 after hours, which is well above the previous day‚Äôs high.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rr5qet4ipkd61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=96d28bf446a714906712503726f5903a681d5368

What this tells me is that GME‚Äôs **true price is still being suppressed**. They are using every tactic possible, even changing the [bid-ask spread rules](https://thefly.com/permalinks/entry.php/id3233043/GME;IRBT-NYSE-changes-bidask-differentials-on-options-for-GameStop-iRobot) on options to specifically target retail‚Äôs buying of options.

We‚Äôre now playing the game against the folks who write the rules of the game.

Some shorts may have covered today - with prices below $60 at one point they had some great opportunities to. However, there is **no way all of the shorts who need to exit covered today.**

The short position still lost 20% from yesterday. They‚Äôve got more fingers in the dam, but it‚Äôs definitely cracking. Also, **every call option purchased prior to 1/25 is ITM and profitable,** while **every put option purchased prior to 1/25 is OTM.**

And, for some reason, the SEC still doesn‚Äôt want to enforce the threshold securities list for GME, where it‚Äôs now **been on for more than 30 days in a highly covered ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rbrf6khjpkd61.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e4f432ff02dbf475a03cc68c54a5a0f5f0de429

# Margin impacts:

Note that at this point, most brokers have increased margin on GME. This means that people that are long or short on margin will need to put up capital to hold their positions.

This also means **puts will get more expensive** as people who sell puts will have to maintain 100% of the notional in their accounts to secure the put, so MMs will have fewer retail sellers of puts to absorb the demand.

That means it‚Äôs not a bad idea to sell puts to acquire shares if you‚Äôre aiming for the long-term and not the squeeze, but keep in mind you‚Äôll need the exact same capital as if you‚Äôd bought the shares, so it‚Äôs up to you on this.

For shorts, a margin increase while the price is moving against you (even with retracements) is no good.

# My speculation

* Cohen and the GME board have been strangely silent this entire run. It‚Äôs possible they can‚Äôt say anything at all during the pre-earnings quiet period, but I‚Äôm sure they can see what‚Äôs happening.
* MMs will continue to play dirty, but at the same time they will need to continue to need to buy GME shares to delta hedge 1/29 and later ITM options as we get closer to expiry.

# Things to be careful about

As you can see, this is no easy win. I've been in GME for a few months but I've seen almost every trick in the book. In addition to the [suggestions I wrote about in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/), here‚Äôs some things to be careful about.

* **Be careful about swapping ITM calls for OTM calls:** it can be tempting to trade-up your options for higher return, but be mindful of the delta impact. You may actually be driving the sale of shares by MMs when you don‚Äôt mean to. For example, if you sell a .5 delta call for 2 .2 delta calls, that‚Äôs net reduction of 10 shares that MMs have to hold long as leverage.
* **Be careful about being short any calls this week:** Not only do you limit your upside (which is dumb in the prospect of a squeeze), you could end up in a nightmare scenario. A call that ends OTM on Friday could end up ITM after hours if you didn‚Äôt sell it, and you may get assigned while the underlying continues to go up.
* **There are a few other dirty tactics shorts can play.** I‚Äôm not specifically going to share them here because I don‚Äôt want to give the ideas circulation, but
   * **Choose your own limit sells based on personal sell points.** Don‚Äôt copy others and don‚Äôt try to be memey. Make your own decisions.
   * **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it‚Äôs an **attack vector** for you.
* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn‚Äôt resume for the rest of the day? **All your 1/29 calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you‚Äôre taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration.
* **Be careful about buying on margin.** Brokers are rapidly increasing margins. If you bought on margin with 2:1 leverage, and the stock went up 100%, you‚Äôd be in margin call even without a margin change. If the broker moves margin against you, you‚Äôll get to margin call faster.
* **Don‚Äôt bet more than you can afford to lose.** I‚Äôve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing (remember last Monday with the short sale restriction?), you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I‚Äôve held through multiple 30-40% drawdowns in the underlying; and **held through a 50% drawdown today**, so you need to be ready for the volatility.
* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It‚Äôs common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you‚Äôve set a stop loss, be really sure about it.

This is not financial advice; do your own DD. I‚Äôm holding over $1M in shares and calls.

# 1/26 Update

Hi everyone. Sorry for not posting or replying to comments. I was auto-banned from WSB when this post was auto-deleted by the auto-mod. Thanks to u/zjz to reversing the auto-deletion of the post though as it looked like it was helpful to the community.  

Hope you all made a ton of money today!

**Quick Notes:**

* At an after-hours price of **$209 a share**, **every call option, for every expiry, for every strike price is in-the-money. This is the third time this has happened for GME recently.** Amazing. What this means now is that market makers will need to buy a lot of shares to hedge for the calls expiring this week. Heed my above warnings. 
* At this price, shorts **will start to get liquidated.** Combining the 400% weekly gain with the margin requirements increasing across the board, brokers will force close short positions. Starting maybe with the small guys, but it will cause a ripple effect. **Things could move fast.** Some funds may get additional bailouts this week to hold out. 
* **You need to decide your own exit.** Only you know how much $ you're playing with, how much you're willing to lose, how important the $ is to you, etc. **Minimize you're regret, don't maximize your profits.** If you are thinking about taking profits this week, spread out your sells so you don't kick yourself over timing things poorly. Personally, I think we are in **unprecedented territory** and that there's no way all of the shorts have exited already, so we're not done. I could be wrong. See EndGame part 1. 
* **Close spreads.** With every call ITM, you are at the risk of early-assignment. If you don't watch closely, you could be hit with sky-high hard-to-borrow fees and get killed on what you thought was a profitable trade. 
* **Watch for ripple effects. This is already happening.** When funds get liquidated, they have to buy back all their other shorts (see AMC, BBBY) and sell their longs (look at BABA after-hours). Want to play GME without playing GME? Maybe throw a little $ at BBBY. You do you. 
* In EndGame Part 2, I talked about potential investors, and how the higher price is gonna attract the bigger $. Today we saw Chamath, Winklevoss, and others. And then Elon tweeted and simultaneously stimulated the buying frenzy and scared the crap out of shorts. I'm just gonna copy what I said about this potentiality
   * ***Elon****: (Least likely, completely improbable, but cataclysmic event). Elon hates shorts. Elon, with TSLA, went through the pain that GME is going through. TSLA almost went bankrupt because shorts were pushing the price down so it was difficult to raise the cash they needed to survive. Sound familiar?* ***Elon‚Äôs wealth swings more in a day than GME is worth in entirety.*** *Elon could* ***buy all the fucking float of GME with what he makes in 8 hours****. One call from fellow entrepreneur and* [*aspiring twitter-meme-god*](https://twitter.com/ryancohen) *would absolutely wreck the game.*

1. ***If you are short gamestop****, you are one meme purchase by the richest man in the world away from a fucking cataclysmic event. ""Hey son, I heard you like games. So I bought you gamestop. All of it."" üöÄ*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1.) COVID vaccine rollout has started, and we will be able to attend movies soon. The Biden Administration (sorry for getting political, just pls keep reading) has an ambitious plan (100 million vaccines in 100 days or whatever the fuck) and this pandemic is almost over. I‚Äôd give it until the end of the year.

2.) **Most** [**AMC**](https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-ent-movie-theaters-reopening-0123-2021) **theatres** [**are open**](https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean#locations) or they are planning to open soon with social distancing and mask measures in place. They will shut down the food services and concessions, but they are coming back.

3.) **Consumers have a sentimental connection to movies. They will come back**. People are starved for the outside world and will come out in massive hordes to watch movies. People will go out and see movies, take their kids, go on dates, etc. Nothing can replicate the experience of a giant screen and surround audio.

4.) This major influx of blue balled movie goers will cause a major boost in 2021. Then we will see a continuation of the year over year growth we have been seeing since 2012.

5.) The AMC business model is working. The revenue has steadily increased since 2012 year over year. [**In 2012, they made $811 million. In 2019, they made $5.47 billion.**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/206959/revenue-of-amc-theatres/) There has been a steady rise. **THEY ARE NOT IN DECLINE.**

6.) I understand they have many loans, but it is something that can be paid off in a few years with the help of their parent company, Wanda Entertainment, and increased profits in 2021.

7.) They will not go bankrupt. WANDA entertainment, a Chinese company owns the plurality share (20%) and will bail them out if it is necessary. They bought for $2.6 billion in 2012, and have seen a ROI, scoring $2.7 billion in 2013, the year immediately after their purchase. AMC is too good of an asset for Wanda to lose them. Also, AMC can take advantage of new stimulus and other government assistance programs.

8.) It‚Äôs extremely cheap right now because everybody is shorting, and there‚Äôs a pandemic. Corona is only temporary. Everybody thought GameStop was going to go under, until we showed them. Remember that.

9.) If there is interest or heightened trading in the stock, AMC can dilute shares and sell them to help finance operations and pay debt, using stock sales as leverage. AMC just did this today, and they can do it again if needed.

10.) AMC will not go bankrupt, not only because of the potential Wanda bailout, but [**they also raised $917 million today. They have enough runway to stay operational the end of the year. ""Bankruptcy is off the table for now.""**](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/25/amc-ceo-adam-aron-on-917m-financing.html) (We should be able to return to theatres by then.) A slight majority of this new liquidity comes from issuing new shares, as described in 9. They are also planning to do debt/equity swaps, so those who take out debt can hold shares in the company, and AMC won't get fucked over by high loan payments.

11.) [**AMC is about 70% shorted**](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)**, there is much potential to cause a squeeze**. However, there are still many more reasons to invest in AMC beyond a simple short squeeze.

12.) AMC does very well when it is not pandemic. $5.4 billion in revenue last year, and there will be many movies, as well as many moviegoers that come out after the pandemic. Especially with major franchise movies, which have been delayed. They [have also reached a deal with Universal, which allows Universal to do home releases earlier, but stipulates they must be in theatres for 17 days before that.](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/universal-amc-deal-theaters-pandemic-1234801134/)

13.) AMC is only $12 a share right now... Even if it loses, you‚Äôre only going to lose a bit. Meanwhile, the ceiling is high, and there is much potential. If you want in, do it now while it's cheap. People keep talking about how dumb it is to buy during the pandemic, but this is the point of largest potential. Don't wait for the recovery to buy.

14.) AMC used to trade at $10 before the pandemic. Let‚Äôs keep it at its former glory. AMC deserved a $1bn market cap and they got one. They will probably hit $20 tomorrow (predicting $25 by Feb1, peak in summer with COVID all done.).

15.) Even though the Net income is negative and they lose money, it consistently stays in the hundred thousands range, and it does not lose that much. Any autist on here from GME could pay the difference. [**AMC has also increased gross profits year over year, from 2,004,200 in 2016, to 3,493,200.**](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amc)

*(The rest of these bullet points are just jokes, so feel free to skip if you want.)*

16.) Without AMC there‚Äôs no place to spend my AMC points, and there better be a place for me to spend those points because I invested my entire life savings into those damn AMC stubs.

17.) Going to the movies was my childhood. We must save my childhood. DO NOT LET AMC DIE. Save AMC.

18.) You can take ur wife and her bf to the movies when this is over.

19.) The AMC food court literally sells tendies. (But we should call AMC tendies popcorns instead.)

20.) **STONCCS only go up.**

21.) you guys are all retard who cannot think for themselves and will do whatever is echoed in this fucking internet cave.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TL;DR : AMC has done a great job with fundraising and can survive until the end of the year. Vaccine rollout has started, and recovery is coming soon. People are due to return to movies. About 70% of shares are shorted, so we can potentially trigger a squeeze.

# Pandemic recovery & squeeze combo.

**Buy AMC. Or don‚Äôt. Your choice.**

**If you‚Äôre with us, let's save the movies. I hope you like popcorn. Get on the rocket, because you're going to the moon.**

**If you don‚Äôt, then bye bye, I wish you the best.**

Look into Renesola or $SOL they just did a offering to a bank of a quarter billion dollars today which put the stock on sale. This is on top of recently paying off all of their debt and starting a venture into Europe of 1GW of energy this year. (1GW is worth 1 billion dollars alone) it‚Äôs a steal at this price. It dropped from $35 to $25 today and will soon be in the $40-$50 range as it makes it way to $100. That would give it a 5 billion dollar market cap or for comparisons sake 1/5th of Enphase market cap (ENPH) when they make about 1/2 the revenue yearly. It‚Äôs a HEAVILY underpriced stock and will PRINT. Congrats if you get in.

If you‚Äôre wondering why it went down, They did a $250 million shelf offering to a bank. That tanked the price. It will be over after the 27th. Same thing happened at the $40 million offering 2 weeks ago it went from $21 to $16 then back up once the offering was done. Big boys are getting in. I think this will be a $100 stock at a minimum here soon.

# Fellow tards and mod-tards. This is the most boring post you will never read.

We are now entering a potentially dangerous phase for WSB. I won't repeat or cover all the various reasons why people are looking at this sub, nor what they are saying. 

The goal must be to ensure we don't tank this sub, and tank our tendies.

Its pretty simple: people who are used to making the rules and making money of the ignorance of others are on the wrong side of the trade, and they don't like it, and they won't take it laying down. 

üë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄ

They have extremely deep pockets and can throw insane amounts of money lobbying, getting talking heads on tv or lawyering up, if they haven't already. The narrative is pretty clear: WSB is acting like a mob; they are distorting the market; this isn't allowed. 

We are playing into their hands somewhat. We are helping fuel their arguments. If you don't want to lose this sub, here's what you can do

üåïüåùüåîüåìüåõüåíüåóüåòüåëüåñüåô

**1. Don't do dumb shit that will allow people to make legitimate complaints. Simple examples:** 

a. Doxxing or harrassing people e.g. Citron or Melvin Capital.

b. Trying to get people to buy particular shares of one stock in a concerted effort e.g. ""Lets all buy 10-100 shares of GME at 1000 EST.""

c. Publicly representing that we are in any way an organised, singular entity. 

**2. Don't give Reddit a reason to shut this down.** 

a. Chances of the SEC investigating WSB based on complaints are reasonably high; actually taking action though, the chance is v small in my view. For one, it would be hard to show intent and prove who was doing what to the price. Regulators only like to take on slam dunk cases - they dont have enough resources or political capital to waste on potentially losing hands. The exception is if there is a big public interest in doing so...this is another reason to observe point 1 above. This is not to say they won't give Reddit a call to say ""we think you need to sort out A,B,C‚Äù but this is v different from an enforcement action.

b. **Focusing on what the SEC might do misses the point. The threshold for a company disowning a small part of itself, to protect the whole, is very small. Reddit has 330M users. WSB has 2M. You do the math.**

Never mind trying to work out how much revenue Reddit makes from people who produce our quality of meme.

c. Any company who is aware that part of its users are breaking the law, or potentially breaking the law, will not hesitate to cut off the gangrene thumb. No one is going to go in for bat for us for some ideals or whatever. They are worried about bringing attention to the company as a whole, getting regulated, or civil or criminal exposure - as they should be - this is just normal and good governance. 

üíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíé

**3. Follow the rules for the sub. There are four elements here.**

a. Mods needs to tighten the rules to make it clear which conduct is not acceptable. I recommend including a small banner on each thread that states something like ""WSB does not tolerate any market manipulation or other breaches of law and those who do so will be instantly permabanned."" This can be hyperlink link to the rules or even SEC website.

b. But then - and this is important - the rules **must** be enforced. Whenever you have a compliance program in place, a regulator wants to see the compliance program was reasonable to achieve its required outcome e.g. Not breaking the law and that **it was enforced in fact**. If you have rules that are not enforced its almost worse than having no rules.

c. For us users, **don't break the rules**. Simples. 

d. And if you see other users breaking the rules, report it. Sounds like some Gestapo shit but at the end of the day, you either like this sub and want to protect it or you are going to miss the Tendieman. We have to collectively weed out shittiness and the mods are not going to be able to do this on their own - they are simply to retarded ;-) 

**4. Think about a serious plan B platform if this does get shut down.** 

Can't be Reddit - if the powers that be decide we are done, just calling it saulbeatwets or mallmeatnets won't fool them for long.

**5. Think about putting some tendie money aside to kick in for the mother of all lawsuits.** 

If this does go south, we should consider kickstarting a fund to hire the same type of white shoe law firms these dudes hire and get our guys to point out every known act of manipulation and let the SEC decide who the real problem is. This is how you really fight back and win. 

**6. While I have your attention - can we please try not to take out fellow retards here.** 

Its a big bad world and I can watch my own six and yep everyone needs to learn the hard way. But I don't think we should be out here bitching about Melvin etc while we are trying to shaft each other. If you see this shit, call it out and we'll gather our pitchforks. 

In return, **newbies please f$#@ing read some shit on here before you ask the same question ad nauseum** (the answer is the same anyway: ""No, its defo not too late to FOMO everything you or your tribe owns into an extremely volatile YOLO play and there is no way this can go tits up.‚Äù

**TL:DR: They are coming for this sub. Don't make it easy for them; follow the rules and mods enforce them.**

Here's the short of it:

\-  15 U.S.C. ¬ß 78 is the relevant US code that governs market  manipulation.  It's got a few rules.  Publicly traded companies have to  regularly make disclosures (so not WSB).   And it regulates exchanges,  dealers, brokers, insiders, and employees of publicly traded companies  (only you can decide if you're one of these.  Personally, this raised an  interesting question for me because I'm in venture capital (that,  thankfully, it looks like I'm OK on), but YMMV.  Maybe you work for a  meme company and have gone full retard.  You're on your own.

***Obviously, ""market manipulation"" is what everybody here is shaking their titties over.  The rules here are pretty simple.***

\-You  can't ""create false demand"" or overtly distort prices.  Remember, this  law was written in the 1930's, so being able to lie about something's  price was easier back then.  Not really applicable today.  Nobody here  is creating ""false"" demand.  In the case of short squeezes, it's  creating ""actual"" demand.

\-Can't  talk about insider information - yet to see that here, so all good.   Even if I did see it, I wouldn't trust half of you to properly interpret  what you read unless it was full of rocket ships or eggplants.

\-Can't  spread false information about a company.  While I would argue there's  actually a lot of that here, it's not with intent, it's out of ignorance  99 out of 100 times.  Further, the SEC hasn't effectively enforced this  rule in decades.  There are hedge fund managers who openly admit to  breaking this law.   Plus, the original intent with this law was  (apparently, according to lawyer) meant more for companies to not pull  an Enron.  It is, in other words, in effect toothless.

\-The  interesting one is with regards to group trading.  So there's a whole  set of rules that comes into play when an organized group of traders own  more than 5% of a company's stock.  I'll spare all the boring middle  details here because the conclusion is nobody KNOWS how much of a  certain company's stock this sub collectively owns.  I would posit a  very strong theory that we own quite a bit more than 5% of Gamestop,  BUT....there's never been a straw poll to prove it and nobody here has  any real way of knowing if that's the case.  Even if somebody did, they  would have to effectively communicate it to everybody else in the sub to  alert them of potential conflicts/problems, because ""intent"" is a  qualifier for this particular rule.  There's no fucking way this island  of misfit toys is going to be effectively communicated that status.   Even if that information did become widely known, it would be impossible  to prove that rocket emojis, calling people paper handed bitches for  exiting a position, or telling people to let their wives' boyfriends  take care of the women while you're off earning your tendies qualifies  as illegal coordinated manipulation.  Especially given how many bots and  shills Melvin has deployed here lately trying to discourage or scare  people into selling their positions.

Which  means what everybody largely suspected, anyways:  All the people on TV  are blowing hot air to try and scare people at the behest of their hedge  fund manager bosses and to create a story that fits a pre-defined  narrative.  The SEC doesn't give two shits about you and isn't spying on  you (but that plumbing van that's been outside your house might be a  problem - your wife's boyfriend might have gotten a boyfriend), and you  can take off the tin foil.  Unless you're long REYN, in which case  you're probably helping your Boomer stock oh-so-slightly, Randy.

TL:DR:  Securities Fraud requires fraud, which requires intent, so

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ  = fine

üíéü§≤ = fine

üåàüêª  = not just fine but necessary

ü¶çü§≤üí™  = just good strong community bonding

(before reading, note that they are reporting earnings on the morning of the 26th, I will be taking advantage of the IV crush to open a LEAP position)

To start, I see an awful amount of praise for ETF's when playing this sector. However, while ETF's offer greater security in individual investments, the true risk and reward of playing this sector becomes apparent through the lens of comparison. The three ETF's I concentrated on for this DD are:

* **ICLN**
* **TAN**
* **FAN**

While these are all popular, none of them have weighted NEE anywhere near its capitalization potential. Just the next two years alone will nearly certainly double the stock's market cap. They have over $50B in infrastructure investments planned through 2022, and you can be assured that they will have an advantage to this [in the form of tax credits and subsidies.](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/nee-stock-is-ready-to-soar-under-green-biden-administration/)

That's right, Uncle Sam is going to skullfuck this company with tax credits and subsidies to the point that this thing could have a TSLA-esque potential. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, how does this company look when lined up among some competition?

The particular interest with NEE is that they seemingly do it all. This shit is like the Chic-Fil-A of the energy sector. It could honestly not give less of a shit about saving the world, its only focus is cash flow, which in terms that WSB is accustomed to, is just fuel reserves for its inevitable moon mission. I analyzed 3 different companies in the renewable energy sector, and those were

1. Plug Power
   1. slowing of net income in Q/Q growth.
2. Enphase
   1. already boomed. the party for this one got busted pretty fast. imo just a shitty boomer pick
3. First Solar
   1. This one is a legitimate competitor in my view. 
   2. I would honestly invest in this if its revenue sources were more diverse.

So taking these into account, NEE seems as if its obligatory duty is to take the throne of the renewable market (if you're for some reason doubting it even slightly)

# TLDR: EZ CASHFLOW, ECO-CONSCIOUS, and *bigly* expansion with tax credits incoming to help assist.

*ignore the +100%. f¬¥ing boomers sold this shit in premarket.*

# TLDR:

Company established a groundbreaking drug, Voclosporin. It has many benefits (more efficent, orally given, less side affects). They have the patent until 2037(!). The company expects 65K$ per patient - at least 200K patients in the US \* how many are actually treated = 1.3B $. They have 400M $ cash on hand + an aggreement for licensing the drug in Japan + EU for 100M $ + various milestone payments + 10-20% of revenue.

In total:

1.8B $ alone for the first year in the US, 1.3B $ is recurring revenue + 10-20% of revenue once EU/Japan approve the drug. Market cap? Only 2.3B $ Buyout? CEO and Chairman are open for it + have created comps which were bought out in the past by major pharm players.

# Establishing Voclosporin

SLE ( Systemic Lupus Ery. ) is an autoimmune disease. Various stages, various form. One of the worst is Lupus Nephrithis. In this form the functional units of the kidney, the nephrons, are attack by the bodies own immune system. The functions of the kidney fall off a cliff. Untreated the diagnosis is death.

*TLDR: decrease the secretion of protein*

Enter Voclosporin / Le blockbuster

It is a member of the Cyclosporin fam - so called calcineurin inhibitors. As I had to suffer through human physiology in this semster: they inhibite this molecule which turns on various immunological pathways.

# Tendies

The company owns the IP until 2037. This is incredibly bullish. Only one competitor exists: Benelysta by GSK (actually GSK bought the comp and did not develop it themself). They are inferior in every aspect + it¬¥s not an orally given pill but and injection - yikes.

The *CEO was kinda retetarded* during the webcast yesterday. Well he had to be. So this part is a bit hard.

As LN is a rare disease the number of ppl affected is only roughly known. Therefore yesterday was kinda shit with the analysts as they were expecting a precise number on the revenue. The CEO was only able to provide the lower bound on the revenue.

https://preview.redd.it/brsuo5yrmmd61.png?width=1586&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cc001092a8a0c5e773f683b42169b4eeabe3503

AUPH provides patients with the pills package - called a wallet. This wallet contains around 60 pills. The patient takes 6 pills daily - i.e. this package lasts 10 days. Now here I¬¥m a bit retarded BUT the CEO said they price the wallet to be 65K $ meaning a patient will receive the drug for 30 days will net the comp around 3x 65K. However the slides say 65K $ so I¬¥ll leave it at that. => 65K $ per patient

Now, conservative estimates for the number of ppl suffering from LN is 200K - 300K. In my TLDR section I already did some math to figure out that the combination of those low estimates yields around 1.3B $ in revenue. 65K \* 200K \* actually treated patients = 1.3B

Add the 400M $ cash on hand + the licensing agreements and we have around 1.9B $ while the market cap is only 2.3B $. Once the real numbers and not just the low estimates are starting to pile up they will improve the share price.

This disease affects women and people from ""minority populations"" more often. These groups are the prime target of political actions taken by the progressive politicans.

Having this disease be common in those populations the real number of patients to be treated may be higher. On a humanitarian note, ""minority populations"" suffering from a disease and society not giving a damn is pretty bad."|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093312.csv|StockTicker|['A', 'GME']|['GME']|['TLDR', '$AUPH', 'I', 'DD', 'K', 'US', 'B', 'M', 'EU', 'M', 'B', 'US', 'B', 'B', 'CEO', 'D', 'ST', 'W', 'DD', 'SLE', 'C', 'C', 'I', 'LN', 'IP', 'GSK', 'GSK', 'CEO', 'LN', 'CEO', 'AUPH', 'BUT', 'CEO', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'LN', 'K', 'K', 'TLDR', 'I', 'B', 'K', 'K', 'B', 'M', 'B', 'B']|['AUPH', 'ST', 'GSK', 'GSK', 'AUPH']

I think this is going to get a bunch of downvotes because it's not bullish. But someone else recently posted on here that they werent seeing two-sided conversations anymore and it seemed as though there were at least some people who upvoted him. I have enjoyed the actual DD posts I've found on here and thought that this was a good read so I thought I would pass along.

I emailed one of my best friends who runs software for his HF and asked what he thought about BB / whether I should hold onto my shares. I edited / redacted some lines to help protect his identity, and bolded a few for emphasis. His fund was up almost 100% last year and as you'll see in his comments, they were / are long a number of other WSB stocks, which I thought definitely added some credibility.

Anyways, take it for whatever it's worth, but thought I'd pass along. I am going to sell my BB shares at open and buy more GME + the other names he recommended to me, which I'm going to start doing some reading on.

\-----------

Hey man, you should take whatever I say with a grain of salt as nothing I say should be considered investment advice. But to give you a sense, **our biggest winners last year as a fund were TSLA, CRWD, and two companies who sell vertical software into the auto ecosystem (so I'd say we know both the security and auto tech space very well). We also currently own GME shares, which I think this still have room to run.**

**But from my vantage point, the BB move does not reflect fundamentals and the fair value of that stock is materially lower, ie. somewhere in the $7 range, and most likely lower.**

Yes, BB is a cyber security company now, not a mobile phone company. But that's nothing new. You can think of the company as having 3 parts: (1) non auto security (endpoint management + endpoint security), (2) QNX (autos), and (3) IP licensing.

**(1) Non-auto security:** UEM (unified endpoint management) and endpoint security (Cylance, what competes with CRWD). These businesses are getting absolutely smoked. This year was the first year that BB did not appear in the top right Gartner quartile, and MSFT has been eating their lunch bc their offering (InTune) is basically free. Churn in this segment is probably \~20% / year, and has been declining in revenue for multiple years now. Meanwhile, endpoint (Cyclance) has been a disaster. This last year, while the big endpoint companies (Crowdstrike, Carbon Black, Sentinel One) grew close to 100%, Cylance was flat / slightly down y/y (during the biggest endpoint boom in history). Everyone from that team left post acquisition ([https://www.crn.com/news/security/cylance-founder-ceo-stuart-mcclure-exits-months-after-blackberry-deal?itc=refresh](https://www.crn.com/news/security/cylance-founder-ceo-stuart-mcclure-exits-months-after-blackberry-deal?itc=refresh)) and they are falling way behind competitors. This blended segment is going to continue to fall in revenue y/y.

**(2) QNX:** this is probably the best situated segment on a relative basis, but still struggling. The hype around the AWS announcement is way overblown. QNX is not going to be on 100% of cars because of this. MSFT and GOOG both have auto OEM offerings that do the same thing. There is no way AWS is going to get 100% market share, because no one ever gets 100% market share in anything. And in particular, auto OEMs are never going to want a single supplier to have 100% market share, their entire supply chain is built around ensuring that doesnt happen. The only reason AWS partnered with them is because they needed someone who already sold to auto OEM's to get their foot in the door. GOOG already has auto relationships from Android Automotive, while MSFT has a number of auto partners already signed on to their platform ([https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-connected-vehicle-platform-trends-and-investment-areas/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-connected-vehicle-platform-trends-and-investment-areas/)). So this lets AMZN cross-sell with someone and gives BB a reason to choose them. Right now BB has about 30% market share of cars that on the road. Even if that doubles in 6 years, you'd only be up to $8-$10 in value, because as they add ADAS customers, they are losing all their infotainment customers that make up current base. Also, AMZN is not going to ""share"" any of the recurring revenue with BB. BB has said they ""hope"" to cross sell their own new services as part of IVY, and when we talk to auto customers about this they laugh at the idea that they'd rather buy those services from BB over AMZN. Finally, QNX will not ""be needed on every single EV"" as some people claim. I think the bigger market there is rather than have the security built into a proprietary OS like QNX, you'll see cars start to include endpoint agents themselves (ie. from Crowdstrike or Sentinel One). CRWD is piloting this program today with a few OEMs.

**(3) IP Licensing:** this is effectively their mobile division that has transitioned from being in house to sold to 3P's. Mgmt has said this is going to be flat on a forward basis and will start declining in a few years (avg patent life of 10 yrs, no new R&D). If you assume this is currently a 90% gross margin business, then IP currently makes up 100% of the firms profits (software is not yet profitable).

Two final notes - BB's business does not generate ""recurring"" revenue. This is pretty easy to tell bc every quarter, the ""recurring"" ARR goes down, and quarterly revenue is not = at least 25% of the disclosed recurring revenue amount. Also, this is no longer a company at the cutting edge of technology, despite what people are saying. Again, easy way to tell this is that R&D has been falling every quarter since they made the Cylance acquisition two years ago. How many co's do you know that are investing for the cloud / new products that are spending less on R&D every quarter?

**So at the end of the day, you have a software business that has declining revenue and is not yet profitable, an auto product that is losing share on its legacy infotainment business, and an IP business that is going to fall off a cliff in a couple of years. Aggregate revenue is going to be rising low single digits and EBITDA growth after next year will be flat.**

In terms of valuation, dont forget to dilute the share count by 60mm shares for the convert they just issued last quarter. **If you give the company a generous 20x fwd EBITDA on out year bullish numbers the upside case is $10/sh, while the base case is more like $5-7.**

**If you really believed the upside case, then I could see rationale for buying at $6 to play for the $10 of upside.** That's fair. But The idea that this is a $100bn or even $20bn mkt cap is ludicrous. We arent short the name, but I would strongly advise you not to put a significant portion of your money in the stock. It very well may go up bc there's no telling how high stocks on these momentum moves can go, but at some point you have to be the one holding the stock and I dont want it to be you. Stock's can only maintain their value in the multi-billion valuation range at the end of these runs if there is institutional demand to buy the next share (which is what happened in TSLA), and I dont think that exists for BB north of $10.

**I think there are much better things to put your money into.** We still own **GME** (which I know is a a favorite among your friends), which I think has a much better setup. If you want security software exposure, I would tell you we're bullish on **PANW, CRWD, and ZS**. If you want auto tech exposure, I'd say you should look at **LPRO**, which recently SPAC'd and isn't yet followed / understood by the street. A couple other random longs I like right now are **BABA** and **PENN**.

Feel free to lmk if you have any follow up questions. Glad to see you're focused on the fundamentals."|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093315.csv|StockTicker|['$BB', 'DD']|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'BB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'HF', 'BB', 'I', 'I', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'BB', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'TSLA', 'CRWD', 'GME', 'I', 'BB', 'BB', 'QNX', 'IP', 'UEM', 'BB', 'MSFT', 'AWS', 'QNX', 'MSFT', 'GOOG', 'OEM', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'GOOG', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'BB', 'BB', 'ADAS', 'AMZN', 'BB', 'BB', 'IVY', 'BB', 'AMZN', 'QNX', 'I', 'OS', 'QNX', 'CRWD', 'IP', 'IP', 'ARR', 'D', 'D', 'IP', 'BITDA', 'BITDA', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'BB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'PANW', 'CRWD', 'A', 'I']|['GME', 'TSLA', 'GME', 'MSFT', 'MSFT', 'GOOG', 'GOOG', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'AMZN', 'AMZN', 'ARR', 'PANW']

And was asked to post this as a discussion.

The most important thing is actually **until Friday there** will be another **price** battle in which the short sellers will try to keep as many calls as possible outside the price so that they cannot be executed and the broker does not have to buy them on the market to cover them .  
It is particularly critical because **monthly and weekly calls** expire, as far as I know the highest monthly call was **60c 1/29** and **115c 1/29** (left out the new 200c).

The MM will try everything to push the course **below 60** , **our goal to get to 115** . Until then, **expect massive short attacks** , it will probably be even more blatant than yesterday. Since a price limit is harder to keep higher up, don't be surprised if there is a red tag up until then or the lower limit is 60-80.  
For those of you who don't know what is meant, 100xLimit orders at $ 60 are $ 6000 <$ 11500 100x at $ 115 and easier to hold or buy from autistic people.

And almost most importantly **, put your stop loss out** , the **shortsellers try** to trigger as many as possible with their short sales in order to trigger **a chain reaction of panic selling** .

Remember **yesterday we saw exactly that** , price dumping at its finest, although almost no short position was powered.

Should we be **able to hold the $ 115 by Friday** , the banks (! Not the shortsellers) would have to buy an additional 8 million shares to cover the demand for the calls. To achieve this there is really only the possibility üöÄ‚úãüèªüíéü§öüèª,

**Don't be a paper bitch!**

All figures relate to estimates and information or assumptions and observations from DD from here and the Angelsachen forum. Due to the high trading volume, it is not possible to say how the share is currently distributed !!

**This is not a financial advice, but an autistic one.** **Always invest wisely and make your own decisions.**

And now relax America won't open for another 4 hours anyway.

Keeping holding and relax.**

With a lot of chatter going around and some excellent DD being shared with lots of technical analysis there still seems to be doubt as to 1) If the squeeze is happening, and 2) How to capitalize on it.  Please spend a few minutes reading this so you're more informed as a trader (even if this is your first time being a trader).  This is not a technical analysis but more a plain English guide:

1. **Crazy price volatility:** I think this one is self-explanatory but if you're wondering what price volatility looks like go check out a Google chart from the past week or so.  A stock moving up 20%+ day after day after day is not typical.
2. **Those who stand to lose the most go on the offensive:** At this point it is fairly well established that WSB has many user accounts being used for a variety of purposes, but at the moment many of those accounts are trying to drum up emotional responses to counter the short squeeze.  People hyping new tickers with far less short-term upside, saying that the facts are not true (remember kids: you're entitled to opinions but not your own facts).
3. **Those who stand to lose are taking MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR life lines:** Again, this so self-explanatory but yet still not all of us believe that a squeeze is happening.  During the 2008/2009 crash there were MAJOR US BANKS that were getting $2-5BN in bailout money to prevent the entire economy from collapsing.  Yesterday a relatively small hedge fund posing ZERO systemic risk took a $2.75BN bailout that without it would have likely seen them disappear from the system with ZERO impact to our greater economy as a whole.
4. **Confusion:** Have you noticed that some of the ""smartest guys in the room"" can't seem to agree on television and in the media as to what is going on??  If you actually believe that there is some debate going on amongst the experienced and elite Wall Street types then there may be no hope for you in life.  Con artists prey on the gullible and you will be a slaughtered sheep soon.
5. **Just f-ing hold if you like money!!:** If the above four bullet points haven't convinced you then nothing will so just sit back, relax, and let the men do our work.  If your wrists get weak and your paper hands get so feeble that you sell at these low prices then we (the real men of this sub) are better off without you owning the stock anyway.  AND STOP BUYING OPTIONS YOU STUPID IDIOTS! Calls were great to have bought in 2019, even into mid-to-late 2020, but the price you're paying for them now is a rip-off.  AND, the volatility on the price means your chances of losing money have never been better!

Warren Buffett has famously said at multiple shareholder meetings that he doesn't want people owning Berkshire stock if they're the type of *investor* that trades in and out of positions.  He wants long-holders, people that believe in the mission of the company, believe in the management, and want to get wealthy, NOT RICH.

**You might be in the middle of something that will not happen to you again EVER in your investing life, or perhaps only a handful of times from now until you retire.  Don't screw it up by thinking that jumping off the fastest moving train, and one that is unique and a statistical anomaly, is going to happen again on some other ticker that has gotten the unfortunate meme status that the elite are trying to trick you into right now.**

NOK, BB, and others may all go up in the future and if you want to invest in them then you should wait.  How long??  Who knows.  And who cares?!?!?  You're probably in your 20's or even teens, you have plenty of time to invest in many good companies in your lifetime but quite likely NONE will go through this kind of movement over a period of a few weeks and if you sell now (you paper handed p-ssy) you will never forgive yourself.  HOLD, be patient, let the shorts bleed themselves to death, and in the meantime go focus on something other than Reddit!

Good luck to all.

***EDIT: I somehow forgot to add positions.  In keeping with the suggestion of others not to broadcast exact holdings (don't show the enemies your positions!) I will just say I have a high six-figure position of SHARES ONLY and I haven't even thought about selling for a moment.  This is not my biggest holding and my life won't be changed whether it eventually settles at $50/share or $500/share and YOURS WON'T EITHER SO BE STRONG.***

***EDIT II: Stop calling it a ""Loss"" if you bought at $X and it is now below $X.  An actual loss has not occurred until AFTER you sell, and if you don't sell then you won't lose.  It is not more complicated than that.  Seasoned investors (which are on the other side of every trade that you do) rely on you being emotional because they are using a computer with no emotion at all.  Don't be the sucker and don't actually lose money when instead you could actually have a gain!***"|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093238.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['RMENT', 'DD', 'I', 'A', 'WSB', 'LLION', 'OLLAR', 'MAJOR', 'US', 'BANKS', 'BN', 'ZERO', 'BN', 'ZERO', 'AND', 'STOP', 'UYING', 'TIONS', 'YOU', 'TUPID', 'DIOTS', 'AND', 'NOT', 'RICH', 'EVER', 'NOK', 'BB', 'NONE', 'HOLD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'HARES', 'ONLY', 'I', 'YOURS', 'T', 'ITHER', 'SO', 'BE', 'TRONG', 'EDIT', '$X', '$X', 'AFTER']|['NOK']

1:  NOK is an NEM. do you know who else is an NEM, Huawei, Ericsson, ZTE. hell even Samsung has aggressivly entered the market a couple of years ago and are strongly positioning themselves especially after Trump banned ZTE and Huawei.
these NEMs are called HENZ (Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia, ZTE) then changed to HENS as samsung grabbed ZTE by their banned balls. all these guys have been involved heavily in 5G. I know that from my 5G centric company.
EDIT: by centric I mean F500 at the heart of the 5G ecosystem.

2: most of the first world is almost done with 5G. yes infrastructure wise done. Im not talking about Zimbabwe (even though Huawei is clear winner in africa btw). 
btw for U.S smooth brains who cant think about the rest of the world, Verizon invested a lot in their 5G infrastructure and towers already, the best in NOT yet to come, it has already been done. AT&T are 90% done, they did a gay way in which all they need is a software update to switch to 5G from LTE. yes there is still a lot of money to be made in 5G market, but thats for full layer solutions, including application layer. I kid you not but people especially in the wireless infrastructure are looking at 6G now... *cough* samsung *cough*

3: NOK is a good company for INVESTING LONG TERM.  they have been early adapters for 5G in their strategy initiative and their execution plan. but that was just the necessarily of growth and survival. lol.of course they got in 5G! what else would they have done. it is the same way how they are going to get in 6G as well and 7G later... you smooth brains saying ""WoW 5G!"" is like looking at a house flipper guy by profession, who buys houses then flips them and sells them, and you retard say, this guy must be on the moon cause he keeps buying houses! well no shit idiots its what they do.

listen, I like NOK, great guys. but dont be fucking retards falling for the bots and implants by MM and melvin capital. NOK isnt going to moon. they are going to steadily grow so take that shit back to r/investing.

tldr; nothing special about NOK other than the cheap price tag ideal by MM to distract paper hands, HOLD your GME and squeeze.

TLDR; Mass BB call option buying has forced the big boys to short this like crazy. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

I wanted to point out that whats happening this week in BlackBerry is actually quite amazing. Yesterday, you beautiful retards bought and opened tens of thousands of option contracts that expire this Friday at $25 in BB. There was also a mass buying of the $20 contracts. What we are seeing today and saw some yesterday is big boys are coming in and shorting this stock like crazy. These guys sold thousands of contracts to us for this Friday and they HAVE to keep the BB price under $25 or this is GME all over again.

This is actually the type of setup a large hedge fund might see and say hey if we can push BB over 25 by Friday it will cause so much frenetic buying that the stock might hit 40. 

Likely nothing will come of this, but if you are wondering why your favorite meme play is down today despite good news (BAIDU partnership) and LOTS of new money coming in on the buy side this is why.

"" I am long on MARA at these price levels. Here is why:- The [Elliot wave](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/elliottwaves/) theory seems to be taking play here and it looks like we are about to start impulsive wave 5 after seeing corrective wave 4. Follow the patterns.- The [RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/relativestrengthindex/) is bottoming out (oversold), perfect conditions for the tide to turn after a steep correction.- We seem to be bouncing off the 1.618 FIB, which we must hold or I think we will break down to the .618 FIB and bottom resistance levels around $8.

Everything is not matching up perfectly on the chart, but damn near close. ""

I see an uptrend followed by a bull run and then the famous pennant. A pennant is a sign that there is a breakout impending. The fact that it is doing a pennant in an uptrend makes it a bullish pennant.

I am holding 200 shares with a BE of $6.86. PT is $28. I'll be looking to sell my shares and roll into buying weekly calls if it doesn't break out tomorrow.

This is a big moment. A tug of war between tradition and the future.

Hedge fund managers live in the past, and continue to look down upon the retail investors. They truly believe that we, the average retail investors, don't know anything about finances or the market (which may be true), and we're just gambling our money away.

We don't know any better. WE NEED HEDGE FUND MANAGERS TO TELL US WHAT TO DO! SAVE US!

This is the world they want to live in. This was the past.

Remember that scene from the Sopranos, where Tony's wife calls to buy 5000 shares of Webonics, after she was manipulated emotionally to so?  Institutions and hedge funds want us to be stuck in that world.

They're scared of the future.

They're scared because, so much information is available for free now. THere's no more fees for trading. We have large communities that discuss stocks and trading openly.

We can think and make decisions for ourselves, which scares the FUCK out of old school institutions and hedge funds.

Fuck them all. This affects every single one of you, whether or not you're holding $GME.

TLDR: Fuck hedge funds. This is a crosspoint into the future.

Not only did they not account for the tsunami of smooth-brains YOLOing FD's, (spearheaded by big dick big brain ape kings like DFV) they're going bankrupt for it.

From this day forth, every hedgefund (especially ones that short) will have to account for the Retard Factor ‚Ñ¢. There will always be the risk of the Robinhood Autists taking their Little Johns to tendietown!

I am more than confident to say that a series of Whales have come to battle alongside with us retail shareholders. The Amount of volume and the amount of capital that was thrown at this stock today was nothing short of remarkable. The battle started at 11:01am EST, when the first short attack began, and the stock was able to find the floor at about $97.02. What followed was absolutely mind blowing.

For the next nearly two hours there was a series of extremely systematic buying. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that the whales have come to our aid. If you look at the chart below you will see that every 45 minutes there is a short attack of some sort and that attack is was denied every single time. Now I am not doubting at all in the strenght of out community, but the only folks out there with this much capital are other insitututions that want in on this historical event.

That's right I beleive at this time the Rohirrim has arrived lead by a mass of insitutional investors that want a slice of that 2.75 Billion dollar bail out. And they are willing to shell out at premium prices to bleed Melvin Capital Dry. There is still 30 minutes left in this session, lets just see how this plays out.

This is just an observation with rough hypothesis based on today's oberserved trading activity and is not advice.

EDIT: Just a Quick Update

[The BALLS on the trade desks of these firms. They all must have custom Hagar Pants being made in a spare office on the daily.](https://preview.redd.it/3ekdo813rqd61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcc42e0badc92f6e84af4435805fdc7eebc1bea3)

Looks like according to Level two trading, there is a significant ""Sell Wall"" at $150 for about 54k shares. So there is going to need to be some significant volume to push through that level, which is completely possible at the open.

   *  More than $1b of normalized free cash flow generation on ¬∞$7b market cap. Guidance of $875-$975m in 21 with some excess cash flow.
   * Trades at like a 14-15% FCF yield vs. packaging comps trading at 6-7%, implying stock can double. FCF yields this high at time when Treasury rates at historical lows.

* Good growth for the industry 
   * Grew 4% in most September quarter and solid growth expected to continue.
   * Plastics are not going away and are actually growing.
* Cheap vs. Competitors
   * Trades at ~7.6x EV/EBITDA vs. its closest competitor Amcor trading at ~11.5-12x.  (BERY is #2 and Amcor is #1 in plastic packaging with Berry being very close behind in size)
   * Small private transactions in the plastic packaging space on lower quality businesses have been in high single-digit context to low to mid-double digit context (10x+)
   * Stock more than doubles if it closes the valuation gap.
* Will start giving $ to Bulls this year
   * Company expects to start dividend/buybacks sometime in 21 after reaching its leverage target.
* Global leadership position with scale
   * 2nd largest plastics producers (~90%+ of biggest) and more double the third largest.
* Strong sustainability thesis
   * Plastic is actually better for the environment in terms of water usage, greenhouse gas emissions, solid waste, and energy than other items
* Leverage going down. Expects to reach 3.8-3.9x by September 2021
   * Should be able to start share buybacks/dividends to give cash to holders this year in 2021.
* Good acquisition history and consolidation opportunity
   * Strong track record of completing acquisitions and getting good synergies to make shareholder value.
   * BERY can continue to acquire small names and get cost-synergies, creating value.
* Not very well known	
   * Stock 98% held by üåà institutional boomers. Huge opportunity as it becomes more well known
* Downside Limited
   * Stock pretty fundamentally cheap even if bull case doesn‚Äôt play. Even in ‚Äúworst case‚Äù, hard to see this stock down more than 20% vs. current levels ex another great depression.  Downside is limited given the defensive industry and strong cash generation and ability of the company repurchase stocks beginning this year if the stock begins too cheap.
   * Pandemic also good for this stock as it makes masks.

üåà üêª üêª üêª

**Bear Case:**

* Boring/Boomer  Stock
   * Stock is not currently sexy and is in a ‚Äúboring‚Äù industry compared to EVs and traditional technology
* Low short Interest
   * Short interest less than 3% of the float so a short-squeeze is not an upside/thesis
* ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù leverage
   * Levered ~4.4x, currently, which is higher than other blue-chip names
* Plastic Risk
   * Boomer üåà üêª‚Äòs are worried about plastics going away, even though they‚Äôre not and growing. Business needs to show good organic growth to get rid of this fear.
* Raw material volatility
   * Company has to pass-through raw material changes to customers, which can cause short-term volatility. However company has strong pass-through mechanism and history doing it.

Key Catalysts:
* Earnings- Q4 Earnings Friday Feb 5th and Q1 earnings sometime in May.
   * Key question for earnings is continued organic growth of the business. Continued demonstration of growth allows this business to re-rate higher.
* Berry hitting 4x leverage and announcing either share buybacks or a dividend. Predict this to occur in mid 2021
   * Lower leverage and announcement of capital return may allow this business to re-rate higher.

**Prediction:**

I believe the stock offers strong upside in the highest probability base and bull case scenarios with limited downside in the bear case scenario.	

**Base Case Scenario:** Berry de-levers throughout this year to 4x or less and reports continued strong organic growth, partially helped by growth in their health-sector (BERY sells masks) and the industrial recovery when it occurs later in the year. They announce capital return to equity shareholders as well. The combination of these factors causes the business to re-rate closer to Amcor to ~10x EV/EBITDA or an 8% FCF yield in my base case. This leaves the stock at $100 in base case (roughly a double).

**Bull Case Scenario:** is this re-rates along with the market and üåà üêª  boomers realizing plastic continues to grow, allowing both it and its plastics comps to re-rate closer to the 13x-15x EV/EBITDA range, putting you at  a $150-$180 stock price target (making this potentially a triple). This is probably less likely in the short-term (next 1 year, but can occur if investing with a multi-year timeline)

üåà üêª  **Case Scenario:** Stock De-rates to 6.5x EV/EBITDA with soft organic growth , 16-18% FCF yield with a stock price of ~$43. Stock stays dirt cheap and is priced like plastics will not exist after 2026. I find this unlikely and this is only ~15% downside vs. today‚Äôs price.

Now that Melvin is bankrupt, their position goes to their broker which are the big banks. Now, the banks want to close the position, but there are no paper hands in GME. They want to pay up, with Melvin money but there is none.

They can't even liquidate Melvin long portfolio and pay for their grim mistakes, a sacrifice offering not available.

So here is the problem, we can't win against the banks. If we are winning against the bank, our big boys in GME will get a talk with big brother.

Now if you read my post history you will find out that I am permabull holding $BB shares from $3 to $20. This is not why I am writing this DD on üöÄGMEüöÄ, no, full stop. I want üöÄGMEüöÄ brothers to go to one trillion dollars, because I know at the end of the day some of that will come to the deep value play of $BB.

The issue is if the banks who are soon forced to hold bankrupt short position cannot cover because of  üíéü§ö  =   üöÄ   üöÄ   üöÄ . Then there is a big problem, now the problem is not big right now since the market cap is only 10B on   üöÄ GME  üöÄ , but lets say we 10x again and head to 100B, one trillion, then this will bring down big banks.

So here it is. 

&#x200B;

CRSR - Corsair Gaming

&#x200B;

Net Revenue for Q3 was $457.1 million - 60.7% increase year-over-year.

&#x200B;

Gross Profit was 127.9 Million an increase of 112% year-over year with gross margin of 28%.

&#x200B;

This was BEFORE Christmas, Black Friday, and winter break. These are going to skyrocket even further. 

&#x200B;

For Q4 The Preliminary Financial Results are as follows:

&#x200B;

Net Revenue to be about 1.7 Billion

&#x200B;

Net income was around 101 Million 

&#x200B;

The Market Cap for this stock is \~3.31 B and their Revenue for Q4 is half of that? Insane. I'm likely expecting it to be way over the estimations above just like when they doubled expectations the quarter before. All kids have  had to do all lockdown/winter break is play on their PC's, Consoles, and your wive's boyfriends PC. The floor for this is 35$ as shown by the past month and a half and It peaked at 51$. I have a price target of at least 55$ and possible 60$+ Corsair also owns Elgato.

&#x200B;

These numbers aren't going to drop either after COVID. When you invest this much money into a gaming setup for you or your child or whatever. They will keep putting money in. When their mouse breaks from smashing it after losing an online game like the baby they are. Or perhaps after they spill their Mountain Dew all over their mousepad? A lot of things that this pandemic has made us accustomed to are here to stay. I bought a bunch of CRSR Equipment a few years back and I still love it and have gifted the mousepads. I have bought every single dip the past month and I'm waiting for my big payday to mars   üöÄ     üöÄ     üöÄ  

&#x200B;

This is also just good long term if you don't want to play the options game (IV is really high right now premiums a bit much for my taste. 

&#x200B;

I listened into their last earnings call and they really know the esports industry and what to do with it. 

&#x200B;

They are expected to blowout earnings again. I sure as hell am not going to miss out on this like I missed on GME and partly BB.

&#x200B;

Obviously none of this is investment advice and please do your own DD. I'm just a brainlet with the robinhood app who gets high off gaming and gambling. 

&#x200B;

Positions: 305 Shares - I had 40$ Calls in December but took profits on them no longer holding.

I‚Äôll tell you now that $GME was and is a historical moment and I‚Äôd like to congratulate all who were part of it and still continue to be. For those who don‚Äôt really know why $GME has been rising so drastically; it‚Äôs because of its short interest. $GME had a short interest of 138%, more than double the percentage of the next most shorted stock in all of the market. $GME is not a company that‚Äôs going to succeed, it was merely a play to get gains off a short squeeze, but you already knew that. The squeeze can still continue and may continue to do so, however the awareness of WSB is growing larger and larger very quickly. Which means more people will want to start taking their profits, and some will even try to continue to short $GME. It could only continue to rise if people do NOT sell and only more shares are bought, which is unpredictable. Just know that $GME is something that happens once in a blue moon and we‚Äôll be required to go back to our peasant 200% gains instead of 800%.

Which is why I‚Äôm here to give you the next best play, that focuses solely on predictability. Now it won‚Äôt cone as a surprise to say this ticker is $PLTR. I‚Äôm a longtime $PLTR holder but only because it proposes a huge opportunity if executed well, and slightly less significant opportunity if butchered. Either way, there‚Äôs opportunity.

IMPORTANT SECTION üöÄ:
Lockup is coming very very quickly, upon lockup ending insiders will be able to sell their shares for the first time since the stock has been $10. The stock has more than tripled and there‚Äôs no doubt that tons of positions will be sold. Currently $PLTR has 20% of shares available to be publicly traded and of that percentage; majority is held by the general public or retail investors (us). The other 80% of shares are being held in lockup by insiders and cannot be traded publicly until lockup ends. If chunks of these shares are sold upon lockup ending, and general public happens to claim majority of the 80% too, then we control the stock entirely. The only way this is possible is if everyone literally buys anything they can with everything they can right upon lockup ending. 

TL;DR: General public needs to control majority shares when insiders are finally able to sell their positions when lockup ends. We currently own majority of the 20% that‚Äôs publicly available.

A bunch of Asperger's, WoW playing, poor ""kids"" managed to cause an epic squeeze in $GME. Make no mistake you have the attention of the big boys NOW.

&nbsp;

Now an absolute giant in the hedge fund world has gotten in, and it is against WSB. Ken Griffin (he has a camera in his office that shows his luxury car collection in the garage) may not be a name you know, but he is  a HUGE name in the hedge and quant fund world. After today and likely tomorrow, he is at risk of losing 2 Billion plus in his fund. I repeat he will NOT let this happen.

&nbsp;

These are the type of guys who do insider trading for fun at their country club. They front run clients, put out fake news stories, have direct links to the SEC board, and would literally murder everyone in here to increase their personal wealth.

&nbsp;


**What to expect  from them next:**


1. Convince (strongarm) the SEC to completely HALT trading on GME. They will make up a bullshit excuse, and force the exchange to stop allowing trades on the stock.

2. Hire big name attorneys, and force reddit to shut down WSB   
3. Pressure $GME executives to issue NEW shares at this price, and bail the shorts out. This is pretty easy for them to do. You have to understand almost all the people at this level of wealth know each other. Its a small club. 

&nbsp;



**What can you do to stop this:**

1. Bring attention to their tactics via going to the media (Twitter, NYT, Senator Elizabeth Warren or the like)

2. File SEC complaints that show that NAKED short selling is happening on GME, and is creating an actual organic move. There are more shares SHORT than their are FLOAT (traded in every day trading).

**Retail does not want to be manipulated anymore.**

For decades Wall Street was manipulating securities, getting away with it, and blaming it on others. Through the media, bullshit target prices, naked short selling, or other forms of manipulation mentioned [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_manipulation) (Kenneth, [this one](https://www.ft.com/content/16cee174-3b7f-11ea-b232-000f4477fbca)'s for you). Citadel and many other MMs - don't misinterpret with Market Makers, we're talking about Market Manipulators here - got away with their dirty tactics to make shitload of money and screw people over. They finally got caught in their own game and tried everything to turn it around, but Shitron didn't work, the media didn't work, more aggressive selling didn't work. Now they're calling through some random crooks for regulations.

**BULLSHIT.** Regulation for what? Exchange of ideas? Our own Due Diligence? Winning against you in your own game? Yeah, in most cases your buddies at the SEC would gladly do so if you tell them anyway. This time though? People finally came to the realisation what the fuck you guys are doing over there. It was known by many since 2008 but people forgot quickly, and now is the time to remind them that you are no one else's friend but your crooked buddies.

I never thought I'd say this, but this community showed more leadership and guidance than any other media network. Providing knowledge, research, answers, many of you proven that **you are better people** than these fuckers with billions of dollars of AUM. You should be proud of yourselves as you are leading an unprecedented event in the history of finance. **Unprecedented.** This is why you should still guide others and be an example. Of course, we are not an entity and we will never be - just remember that you are a part of something great, maybe something that will change the way financial world operates, in a smaller or larger way. Remember that there are sharks among us who got pissed at the dirty games as well (shoutout to you Elon & Chamath). We are not alone.

They blame us? Let's blame them. They will lose all credibility sooner than later, not to mention this incoming generation. The media is here now, you still might convince my 80-year old grandpa that the internet is something out of Pandora's Box, but soon enough you won't be able to convince a single person. We are an important source of information for many people, and I'm not talking about WSB, but about the people that make it. Let's go there in the world and spread the facts.

Hence, dear Market Manipulators:

***Do not mislead again. Do not manipulate again. Get your facts straight. Retail matters, and you will see it.*** "|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093229.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['$GME', 'LSHIT', 'SEC', 'I', 'AUM', 'WSB']|['GME']

CenturyLink (LUMN) Lumen Technologies has been selected to help Nebraska transition onto their next generation 911 emergency system. By using this next generation emergency system it will help improve the delivery of emergency calls by not only allowing residences to voice call but also allowing them to send text messages, videos and pictures to emergency responders.

# CenturyLink signed 5 year contract with Nebraska Public Service Commission

They signed a contract with the State of Nebraska Public Service Commission which establishes a statewide Emergency Services Internet Protocol Network (ESInet) that serves approximately 70 PSAPs, with the goal of having all seven PSAP regions connected to the ESInet by the end of 2022. The contract, which Lumen had won previously, has an initial term of five years with five one-year options

# NG911 Features

Lumen's enhancements to its NG911 platform will provide new customers with a portal featuring a customer management dashboard with access to:

* a real-time view of the health of customer NG911 systems;
* the call path from origination through delivery to the public safety answering point (PSAP);
* component level monitoring, status, inventory and diagnosis; and
* reporting metrics.

When someone thinks a stock is going to go down or a company will go bankrupt, they can borrow shares from their broker to open a ""short"" position.  They then sell the shares immediately at the current market price.  They have a specified amount of time to return the borrowed shares to the brokerage.

If the stock does go down, the investor buys that number of shares at the now lower current market price, and then returns them to the broker.  He/she keeps the difference.

If the stock goes up, they have to ""cover"" their position.  They can ""buy-to-close"" whenever they want, but many of them will wait for a very long time because they are large firms who have a lot of money and leeway with their brokerage.  However, if a stock keeps going up and up, the brokerages can call the investor and demand the shares back to hedge *their* losses.  This forced buying drives the price up even more, which then causes other brokerages to make the same phone call to their clients, and so on and so forth.  This is called a ""short squeeze"".

\---

GameStop is a declining brick-and-mortar video game retailer.  Their management has not adapted to the digital world where many video games are downloaded instead of on discs.  They have been making some moves in the right direction, such as closing underperforming stores and paying down some debt, but they need to reinvent themselves to succeed.  Many large investors/firms have seen this coming and took out short positions a few years ago.  The stock kept going down so the brokerages and banks hadn't called yet. GME is the most-heavily shorted stock on the market.  More shares are shorted than are in circulation.  It's called ""naked short selling"", it's complicated, and some of it is probably illegal but the SEC looks away.

[Ryan Cohen](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890) founded Chewy.com when he was 25 and sold it six or so years later for $3.5 billion.  Last August, he purchased 9% of GME's shares.  When it was disclosed in the SEC filings, the stock went up 22% in a day (which is a LOT in normal circumstances).  The thought being that he was going to attempt to take over the company.  There was a lot of speculation online.  In late November he wrote a [strongly-worded letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf) to the Board of Directors.

Shortly before Christmas, he disclosed that he had bought more shares and now owns 12.9% of the company.  He bought the new shares at $16ish, after buying the first batch around $4.  When someone owns 10% or more of a company, there are heavy limitations on how much they can sell at one time, in a given period, and they have to disclose everything.

This signaled that he wasn't in it for a quick buck and he probably really was going to try to take over and modernize the entire company.  Gamestop has something like 55 million members in their club/newsletter thing, and that data can be used to make a lot of money through targeted advertising and such.   There have also been confirmed rumors that the company will be making a serious run at the fast-growing PC gaming market (many serious gamers build their own computers).  Video game competitions are also very popular and can be capitalized on.  The stock continued to slowly climb, with some sell-offs and such along the way.  It was not for the faint of heart.

Fast-forward to January 10th, when it was announced that Cohen and two of his board members from Chewy were officially appointed to the GameStop Board.  It was really looking like the theories from last fall were correct.  The news sent the stock soaring and the investors who had short positions were in big trouble.  Some of them started covering their debt, but many didn't and still haven't. The ones that did have incurred losses in the collective billions, and there are many more billions still out there that will be lost by short investors.

For the past two weeks, the pro-GameStop investors have shown great interest in the potential turnaround story of a store that plays a big role in their childhood memories.  With the presence of Cohen and his buddies from Chewy, an e-commerce giant, small investors can see that GameStop is now undervalued to those who believe in the new Board members.

The stock has been incredibly volatile as the large investment firms try to drive the price down.  One way they can do this by opening massive new short positions (AKA selling large chunks of shares all at once) as other shorts return their borrowed shares to the pool.  This can be seen many times along the daily charts of GME, in nearly vertical declines.  Knowing the potential of both Cohen and the short squeeze, small investors have been buying up all the dips.  If the shares are being held, and not sold, they are unavailable to be returned to brokerages. This drives the price up even MORE as the short investors scramble to buy whatever shares are available to fill their debt before the price continues to rise. Eventually someone is left holding the shares purchased at the highest possible price, but in this once-in-a-lifetime case, it probably won't be someone with a net worth under $100 million.

I just have a knack for explaining things and lots of people have asked about this topic so I thought I‚Äôd share my own personal thoughts.**

# The bull thesis

To date, the GME play has been pretty simple: buy and hold and wait for the squeeze, whether that comes in hours, days, or weeks. Try not to have a heart attack during the intermittent gamma squeezes, keep your hands diamond strong during the manipulated downward spikes, and buy baby buy.

It‚Äôs rapidly becoming apparent that we will soon enter the GME endgame. Before you can come up with an exit strategy or, if you‚Äôre still on the fence, decide whether to jump in, you need to form an opinion about the GME bull thesis, *without considering the short squeeze*. Your thoughts on the bull thesis will dictate how you play it from here on out.

One braindead simple way to calculate a fair stock price for a company is to use a ""times-revenue"" valuation. You take the company's revenue ($6.466B in 2020) and multiply by some magic number (often 0.5 for low-growth companies and 2 for high-growth companies), then divide by the float (number of shares available to trade, 50.65M). A times-revenue multiplier of 0.5 gives a GME stock price of $64, while a multiplier of 2 gives $255.

This isn't a particularly sophisticated method but whatever, I'm not a particularly sophisticated investor.

Working backwards, if Melvin Capital thinks that GME is overpriced at $20 then a times-revenue valuation would suggest a multiplier of 0.16. That's extraordinarily low for a retail business. If you applied that multiplier to Best Buy ($43B revenue in 2020, 231.59M float) you would get a stock price of $30. Best Buy currently trades for $115, which works out to a much more reasonable multiplier of 0.62.

What multiplier is correct? Well, the bulls point out:

* Ryan Cohen (13% stake in GME, sits on the board) has a great e-commerce success story with Chewy, his previous company.
* Three new successful e-commerce board members from Cohen's firm were added to the board in 2020.
* Despite being a brick-and-mortar business and the pandemic, Gamestop's balance sheet isn't bad. They have approx. $550M in debt, but more than that in cash (net cash positive). They have minimal risk of default or bankruptcy in the near future, even without any change to company direction.
* Their traditional core business of game and console sales is not shrinking as fast as many people expected, with major new consoles still supporting optical discs and digital game downloads not accelerating as fast as feared, possibly due to stagnation in the ISP industry. So even if Cohen and his board seats take a long time to roll out new changes, the company is in little danger of any sudden spiral.

So is Melvin right and GME is a dead-end company with no growth potential and should be valued with a times-revenue multiplier vastly below its competitors? Or is it more appropriate to think of it as a brand new business, being spring-boarded off the healthy books of an existing brand by a successful e-commerce businessman alongside a revamped board?

How you judge that determines your exit strategy.

# Exit strategy 1: Just along for the ride

Maybe you don't care at all about GME's balance sheet or Cohen's planned turnaround, you bought a couple shares on a whim to be part of a unique movement. You don't intend to be a long-term Gamestop shareholder nor do you really care if you miss out on the highest peaks, so long as you make a few dollars and get to say you were part of the squeeze.

If I were this person, what would I do? I'd pick a number between 0 and 3 that I feel represents my confidence in the retail market's current expectation for Cohen and GME, and multiply it by 128. I'd submit a limit sell order for all my shares at that share price.

# Exit strategy 2: Pants-shitting fear

You've got a handful of shares and maybe some options and you're up big. You don't know much about squeezes or fundamentals or greeks and every time there's a dip and the stock gets halted you shit your pants and your finger hovers over the sell button. But then the price jumps up and you wipe the drenching sweat off your face and promise to hold firm next time.

If I were this person, what would I do? I'd sell all my options that expire sooner than 30 days at market open to reduce the number of pairs of pants I'm going through. I'd keep all my shares and longer-dated options until the news comes out that the shorts are being liquidated. And I'm not watching hedge fund managers get on Fox Business or CNBC or whatever, I'm following WSB and Twitter for rapid fire updates about short volume. If the short volume as reported by WSB posters drops below, say, 50% I'm selling everything and getting out. I might also pick a maximum times-revenue multiplier (something pretty high, like 4 or 5) and use that for a limit sell for shares.

# Exit strategy 3: Diamond hands

You've got bigger balls than most, and this isn't your first time dumping a significant fraction of your net worth into a company whose financials you've never looked at. You want to ride it to the peak, if at all possible, and you want to impress the pants shitters and the weak-kneed with your maximum gains. You are ok with increasing your cost basis to squeeze out extra tendies on the way to the top.

If I were this person, what would I do? I'd sell my weeklies on open tomorrow and immediately plow every dollar of those 20-bagger returns into shares. If my longer-dated options were purchased at extreme IV I'd do the same for them, otherwise I'd let them ride. I wouldn't sell a single share until the final squeeze, when news comes out that Melvin is done, and then I'd unload (in my pants). See you on the moon, brother.

# Exit strategy 4: u/DeepFuckingValue

IF HE'S STILL IN I'M STILL IN

# FAQ 1: Is it too late to get in?

The best way to judge this is by looking at the exit strategies. Which person are you? If you're (1) then sure, buy a share or two to be part of a once-in-a-decade event, but think of it as a fun expense - a ticket to ride the squeeze train - not an investment. If you're (2) then hell yeah buy those shares baby but avoid options unless there's a dip. If you're (3) or (4) then you're already in and lying to your wife about how deep.

# FAQ 2: Was that the squeeze?! Is it over?

This must get posted every time there's a gamma squeeze. It's midmorning and price suddenly launches into the stratosphere, trading halts, and it crashes back down. No, that wasn't *the* squeeze. Gamma squeezes occur when options prices are rising (due to sudden increased options buying or volatility) faster than market makers can hedge. They're good to get your heart racing but a short squeeze is slower and more stable.

# FAQ 3: How high will it go during the squeeze?

Who knows. $500? $1000? $2000? There's really no way to know. If you have the stones to get those max tendies then you should focus on listening to the emerging news about Melvin Capital and Citadel rather than watching the price. Sell when they're covering and not a moment before. That will be the peak.

# FAQ 4: How long will this take?

Could be tomorrow morning, could be tomorrow afternoon, could be next week. At the rate that shorts are losing money it won't be much longer than that. If you're not in yet, this is the final boarding call.

# FAQ 5: Who will buy our shares at the peak?

The idea behind selling at the peak isn't to sell your shares to another retail trader, but to sell your shares to the desperate short sellers who are forced by their prime brokers to liquidate their positions at any cost. That's the difference between a perfectly legal and time-honored short squeeze and a pump-and-dump. This isn't about irrationally driving the price upwards with the hopes of selling to a bigger idiot, it's about buying and holding and waiting for the shorts to crack and beg us to sell to them.

# FAQ 6: What is the next stock?

Get this thought out of your head. Yeah you just joined WSB and made a few bucks and now you think you found yourself an investment club. **No**. This is a forum for folks to share their risky trade ideas, not a place to coordinate to manipulate the market. Yes, at the moment the consensus is that we can make a boatload of money off of dumbass hedge funds, but think of it less like a pack of draft horses following a path and more like a room of angry, shitting monkeys who happen, for the time being, to be throwing their shit in the same direction.

# FAQ 7: Am I gay?

Many of us grow up to assume that we‚Äôre straight only to find out, later, that we‚Äôre not. Sometimes, we realize this because we have sex dreams, sexual thoughts, or feelings of intense attraction toward people of the same gender as us. However, none of those things ‚Äî sex dreams, sexual thoughts, or even feelings of intense attraction ‚Äî necessarily ‚Äúprove‚Äù your orientation. There are a few different forms of attraction. When it comes to orientation, we usually refer to romantic attraction (who you have strong romantic feelings for and desire a romantic relationship with) and sexual attraction (who you want to engage in sexual activity with). Sometimes we‚Äôre romantically and sexually attracted to the same groups of people. Sometimes we‚Äôre not. For example, it‚Äôs possible to be romantically attracted to men but sexually attracted to men, women, and nonbinary people. This sort of situation is called ‚Äúmixed orientation‚Äù or ‚Äúcross orientation‚Äù ‚Äî and it‚Äôs totally OK. Bear this in mind as you consider your sexual and romantic feelings.

- Stop messaging me asking what you should do. Yes, Melvin Capital has been reported to have covered. You have to decide for yourself whether the squeeze is underway or complete and you should exit or whether you want to hold out for more, or take some profits and hold, or whatever. I just gave you a rough guide and some explanation of different thought processes, you have to make the call for yourself.

I‚Äôll also introduce those of you that are unfamiliar how r/wallstreetbet‚Äôs favorite gambling device, stock options, actually work and how they can be used by this subreddit as a weapon of mass destruction against hedge funds like Melvin - all dumbed down to a fifth grade reading level so that the average person in this subreddit will mostly understand what I‚Äôm talking about.

### Shorting

**How It Works**

Most traditional (i.e. boomer) investors usually try to make money by going long - i.e. ‚Äúbuy low and sell high‚Äù; this is when you buy a stock thinking it will go up in the future (bullish). Shorting is the opposite of this, you ‚Äúsell high and buy low‚Äù, thinking the stock will go down in the future (bearish). This is usually done through the broker, where the prospective short seller would ‚Äúborrow‚Äù the shares from them, and they would need to pay back these shares in some future date by ‚Äúcovering their shorts‚Äù - or buying back the exact same quantity of shares they owe the broker.

For example, imagine that there were only 10 Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards in the world. Because nobody wants to deal with taking physical possession of these cards and risk losing their Pokemon card in their laundry or something, everyone pays a Pokemon card dealer a small fee to store it for them. Through their dealer, you can buy and sell these Pokemon cards as well. A üåàüêª realizes that maybe Pokemon cards are dumb and borrows 2 Surprised Pikachu cards (who has a prearranged agreement with some institutional Pokemon card hoarder to loan them out for interest) and sell them for $420 each, thinking that they're actually work $100 at most, and plans to buy the Pokemon cards back at that price to repay his Pokemon card loan (i.e. covering their shorts) - this is a short sale. Since no one actually wants to physically hold these Pokemon cards, these cards physically stay with the dealer who could then lend out these exact same Pokemon card if the buyer also has an agreement to allow them to do so. This means that you can actually have people owing more than the total number of Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards in existence (i.e. short interest > 100%).

Replace ‚ÄúSurprised Pikachu Pokemon card‚Äù with stocks and ‚ÄúPokemon card dealer‚Äù with ‚Äúbroker‚Äù and you have a short sale of shares. Interestingly enough, this also applies 80% to how banks work as well.

**Short Squeezes**

So when does a short seller need to cover their shorts? Well, either when a) The short seller wants to, either to take profit or to stop a loss, b) Their broker forces them to through a margin call, or c) The broker forces them to as the broker has recalled their loan, usually for a hard to borrow stock - they get ‚Äúbought in‚Äù. Today, we‚Äôll focus on C) because this is how short squeezes happen.

So, what does a broker recalling their loan mean? Well, to go back to the Pokemon card example, imagine that the dealer only has 6 Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards that he‚Äôs legally allowed to loan out. Some more üåàüêª short sells all the 6 remaining Pokemon cards until the dealer has no more available on hand. So what happens when someone wants to buy a Surprised Pikachu Pokemon Card and doesn‚Äôt want the dealer to lend out their cards? He‚Äôll have to force one of those üåàüêª to buy back the card that they owe them so the dealer can give it to the prospective buyer. But who can the üåàüêª buy back the card from? The dealer. But the dealer doesn‚Äôt have any cards to sell, so they need to force another üåàüêª to cover so that the former üåàüêª can cover their shorts. This vicious cycle repeats and leads towards a sudden surge in demand for Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards and a spike in prices for it - a short squeeze.

**The Institutional Factor**

One thing alluded above was that shares can only be borrowed from \*some\* share holders, but not all. So who exactly can and does a broker typically borrow these shares from? These are usually margin accounts of either institutional and sometimes (although much less frequently) retail investors. Usually, when an entity signs a margin agreement, which allows them to borrow either cash or shares from the broker, they give permission to the broker to also lend out their shares in the process, and thereby also give up their voting rights - in case you‚Äôve ever wondered who actually the share \*actually\* belonged to in shareholders meetings. Since almost every institution except Warren Buffet uses margin to a certain extent, and not that many retail investors do, especially given that retirement accounts are forbidden to use margin, and it‚Äôs much easier to ‚Äúfind‚Äù one big source of TSLA shares from one big institution with a margin account rather than find thousands of smaller margin retail accounts who hold TSLA shares, so most of the time, these shares are being borrowed from an institution (i.e. pension fund, hedge fund). This means that shares that are almost disproportionately held by retail investors are much harder to short because they‚Äôre harder to borrow from the broker, and retail-heavy stocks like HTZ, GME, NIO, and NKLA, which virtually no institutions actually hold, will demand high interest rates when shorting and the sellers can much more easily be forced to cover during a short squeeze.

### Stock Options

**What are Stock Options**

A stock option is a contract between the writer and whoever holds it that gives the option holder the right to buy (call option) or sell (put option) 100 shares of the underlying stock on or before the expiry date at a specified strike price. So for example, buying a GME 1/29 $1000c gives whoever the holder of this contract is the option to buy from the writer of this contract 100 shares of GME at $1000 / share on or before 1/29. Obviously if GME is lower than $1000 before that date, the holder would be an idiot to exercise this option to buy GME shares for more than their current market value, so they expire worthless.

This effectively provides the option holder an immense amount of leverage, and provides the opportunity for them to 10x or even 100x their original investment if the underlying asset moves the right way - for example because a subreddit declares war on a hedge fund and pumps up a stock to make them go bankrupt, while limiting their losses to the cost of the option. The option writer will in return receive a premium for the option, potentially risking an infinite amount of money, but with a high likelihood of making a small profit. These writers would either be

1. Theta gang - who are looking to generate a tidy income source from those option premiums and pray that the stock doesn‚Äôt move in the wrong direction too much
2. A market maker - who writes the contract when they see an arbitrage opportunity between the market value of an option and the theoretical value of it, and hedging their contract they wrote by buying / shorting the underlying assets so they effectively don‚Äôt actually take a position in the market.

We‚Äôll go over how 2) works and how this mechanism can be used as a financial nuclear bomb, but first you need to learn some greek. 

**The Greeks**

The greeks in finance is a set of factors that can affect the price of a stock option / group of options

Delta - Change of the option price as the stock price changes

Gamma - Change in Delta as the stock price changes

Vega - Change in the option price as volatility of the stock changes

Theta - The decay in the option price as the expiration date gets nearer

Rho - Change of the option price as the interest rate changes; Most people ignore this

Looking at the greeks of the gambling tickets you buy is very useful to analyzing the ways you can make or lose money on them. Think TSLA will go up a modest amount? Buy a high-Delta call. Think GME is going to üöÄüöÄüöÄ 1000% more? Look for a high Gamma call so your Delta gains accelerate as GME üöÄüåï. Do you feel like a vampire and want to have a steady income source from degenerate r/wallstreetbet gamblers on a stock you think will go flat (relative to historical volatility) over the next few months? Join theta gang and sell a high-Theta and high-Vega option!

**Market Makers**

The Black-Scholes model is a fancy mathematical model that describes a ‚Äúperfect price‚Äù (a lot of caveats here) for a stock option. This is done by showing how every option written can theoretically be perfectly hedged by a series of purchases or short sells on the underlying stock. This means that theoretically, if there is a large gap between the theoretical price from Black Scholes and the actual price for an option, there is an ‚Äúarbitrage‚Äù opportunity - this is where market makers come in.

Market makers are companies that provide liquidity to a market by offering to be counterparty to trades. This is especially useful in stock options, where a single ticker can have thousands of options, and there might be someone who wants to buy a GME 1/29 $1000c but no one is actually actively selling it. However, this option might be listed anyways and Citadel will sell you the call if anyone tries to buy it and then immediately hedge it. In fact, when you buy an option chances are you‚Äôre not actually buying it from its previous owner selling an option they already own, but from a market maker like Citadel (who is responsible for over 99% of all options volume in 3000 stocks).

So what happens when someone buys an option from a market maker? Since the market maker typically can‚Äôt (and probably don‚Äôt want to) take a position, meaning taking a directional bet if a stock goes up or down, they‚Äôll immediately hedge the option they just conjured out of thin air by buying or shorting the equivalent number of shares such that the Delta of those shares is the same as the Delta of the option they wrote to remain Delta-neutral, so if the stock goes up or down their position value doesn‚Äôt change - this is called **Delta hedging**. Furthermore, as the stock price moves up (calls) or down (puts), they‚Äôll need to buy or sell even more of those shares to remain Delta neutral since the Delta will change due to the option‚Äôs Gamma - this is called **Gamma hedging**.

### Putting It All Together - How options can be used as weapons of mass destruction against short sellers

Now we have the tools to understand how these two financial concepts put together can make billion-dollar hedge funds go bankrupt. Through Delta and Gamma hedging of market makers, buyers can have the effect of buying shares dozens of times the value they actually spent buying their option; a XYZ 4/20 690c can cost only $100 in premiums but causes the market maker to buy $2000 in the underlying stock to hedge against it. If you get enough retail investors to do this, they'll have the impact of billion-dollar whales on the market despite their small stimulus-check-funded portfolios.

Now, you do this on a stock that is heavily shorted, and with very little institutions actually holding real shares of these - making it harder for brokers to find shares to borrow, and you have yourself a weapon of mass financial destruction capable of making billions of Melvin‚Äôs money disappear in a single day and potentially have GME üöÄüöÄüöÄ to a trillion dollar market cap.

**How** r/wallstreetbets **Controls the Stock Market**

The one thing that‚Äôs interesting about all of this is r/wallstreebet‚Äôs unique position in being able to facilitate this weapon of mass financial destruction because

1. Most rich people or institutions too risk adverse to buy large amounts of out of the money options (unless you're Chamath or Elon)
2. This can only really happen on stocks that very few institutions (i.e. rich people) actually own, meaning it needs to be held / bought on mass by retail investors
3. In any other scenario where 1 and 2 happen to be true, this would be classified as market manipulation and be immediately shut down by the SEC

**My Positions**

r/wallstreetbets veterans may recognize me as the üåàüêª who wrote those long-ass 2000 word essays about how the [stock market is in a bubble](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) and loaded up on VIX calls last time you heard from me. Although I still stand by my thesis and stocks like GME, TSLA, and NKLA is just proof that we've reached the euphoria phase of it, I learned my lesson that I'm idiot trying to short it (for exactly the reasons described above) and got the fuck out of my position when VIX shot up back in Sept. Most of my ""real money"" has since been moved to gold and crypto, but because I'm a degenerate gambler, I still have a bit of money playing with /ES and a **calls on** [highly-shorted stocks](https://www.highshortinterest.com/) **with meme-stock potential** (i.e. vast majority held by retail investors).

Based on technical fundamentals and the hard lesson I‚Äôve learned from WSB after at some point betting against GME and learning to be a bull. 

Reasons why to invest in AMC:

1) DON‚ÄôT bet against üíéü§≤üèª ppl because you may have small wins but will suffer big losses like I did by betting against them. 

2)GME ppl may be upset at this but I believe AMC actually offers a service you can‚Äôt get anywhere else unless you‚Äôre willing to wait months or a year to watch the latest movies. 

3) PRECOVID ppl were still going to the movies and spending money at the theaters. PRECOVID guidelines destroyed the stock price

4)PRECOVID the stock normal price was about $30-35. I expect as the states open up and COVID becomes the next flu and actors start making new movies, people will flood back to the movie theaters after being away for so long. THUS, AMC will start making money and the stock price will KEEP GOING UP

5) Even with offerings and üåàüêª, AMC is a established company and BANKRUPTCY BEING OFF THE TABLE, make this a  STRONG LONG HOLD üöÄüöÄ

6) I don‚Äôt believe this will have that many üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ as GME because it‚Äôs not shorted over 100% 

7) Based on technical fundamentals and the new WSB fundamentals people are learning, AMC current price is a bargains and will definitely üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ and destroy the üåàüêª that are shorting from $5-30"|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093323.csv|StockTicker|['AMC']|['AMC']|['$AMC', 'SAFE', 'LONG', '$GME', 'WSB', 'GME', 'T', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'AMC', 'COVID', 'COVID', 'COVID', 'I', 'COVID', 'THUS', 'AMC', 'KEEP', 'GOING', 'UP', 'AMC', 'UPTCY', 'BEING', 'OFF', 'THE', 'TABLE', 'TRONG', 'LONG', 'HOLD', 'I', 'GME', 'WSB', 'AMC']|['AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'GME', 'AMC']

People view $AMC the same way they view $GME - just another brick & mortar Mall company that is essentially being destroyed by $AMZN Prime, HBO Max, and Disney+. Fair enough, but I enjoy watching a new release in IMAX with a flatbread pizza in one hand, and a flavored Coke in my other. I think many others do to.

To address everyone who doesn't care about IMAX or going to theaters, $AMC has to simply do ONE VERY SIMPLE THING that will literally blow the minds of the un-imaginative analysts who are predicting doom.  All $AMC has to do is rename ""**AMC Theatres On Demand**"", the program they started in 2019, to **AMC+**.

AMC+ will be a studio-independant platform for movies, documentaries and TV shows. No monthly fee, but rather an revenue-sharing a la carte pricing system. Of course I'd love to see $AMC poach some talent from $NFLX or $DIS when they announce AMC+. One can dream!

TL;DR- $AMC can pivot hard by simply relaunching their existing ""AMC Theatres On Demand"" to AMC+.

AMC is the largest movie theater chain in the country. The pandemic has hurt small business, movie theaters included. The pandemic has concentrated market share on the biggest players, meaning AMC now dominates more of the pie. 

Theaters aren't going away anytime soon. Nicholas Christakis predicted in Apollo's Arrow that we will see a Roaring 20s after the vaccine. The Roaring 20s will see theaters and movie industry boom just like it has historically. Media companies will release a floodgate of movies and demand will be sky high for a while. 

AMC is poised to capture most of that demand and growth, especially given its recent investments into upgrading theaters. Imagine the hype coming from higher demand, tons of stimulus money, and backed up releases. 

300 shares $AMC @ 5.10

TLDR

The largest theater chain in the country will gobble up the remains of the weaker business that couldn't survive the pandemic. AMC will gain a greater share of the pie for greater long term growth. Roaring 20s will see business boom. AMC to the moon. 

And buy the dip! Going right back to $23.

I have better data supporting this, just on mobile right now. Will update with figures. BTW, check Google trends today, AMC tops the results!

Turns out he needed knee surgery that costed $4,000.00. I broke down because I didn't have that much, didn't qualify for the payment plan, and it was either the surgery or wait till his other knee blew out then put him to sleep.

I put all the money I did have in GME around $97/ share & AMC at $4.84 Tuesday morning (a little less than $1k) with an exit plan to get out once I had enough for his surgery. This morning after market open I was able to sell enough to pay for his TPLO surgery! I am in tears and really grateful. Thank you everyone and good luck!

&#x200B;

**DD:**

1. BBBY is one of the highest shorted stocks following GME with a 84 short percentage of float
2. The CEO who turned around Target joined BBBY in Nov 2019, since then, he had kicked out and replaced all original C-Suite
3. BBBY has been transforming and selling all non-core business for profitability and better liquidity
4. The company announced a $675 Million share buyback in the next 3 years, given current share price, that will reduce the amount of shares by 15%, which essentially making BBBY another more than 100% shorted company
5. Guess who also shorts BBBY? Yeah fucking Melvin. Read their 13F, as of Nov 2020, the $ amount of their BBBY short positions is actually higher than their GME short positions. When they are forced to liquidate their positions, BBBY will be short-squeezed as well

BBBY is like the little brother of GME. There is no conflict between buying BBBY and GME, it is another way to fuck Melvin without paying extreme high premiums on GME calls.

Never posted because I just like lurking the sub. All of this talk of GME recently has left the sub feeling one dimensional and seems to discourage other potential winning stocks. 

People seem to think everything is a comparison to GME. It isn't. Some people want to invest in BB because it looks more promising with it's tech and pivoting market strategy. Some people want AMC because it tanked due to a pandemic and they want to keep the largest movie theater chain alive or see the potential in recovery. (AMC was over $30 pre-COVID.)

There are many posts discouraging or dissuading people from investing in other companies, but particularly those 2. Yes I'm on the GME rocket üöÄüöÄüöÄ. But that doesn't mean I can't make other healthy investments that have potential too.

They are literally trying to create new social trends to divert funds away from GME.

I'm completely guessing here. But the lack of age in the NOK and AMC posts is a FACT. I just reported several as spam.

Disclosure: I am long GME. Fuck the funds. Not financial advice, this post is a statement of fact about the account age of recent NOK and AMC spam in this sub.

Edit: tons of comments here so if you're seeing this here is the advice I have. This is not financial advice, it's standard Reddit advice.

**When evaluating a post, go to that users profile page. Their actual profile page, click on their name you dolt don't just hover over it. Ok you made it. How many posts do they have, how many comments? How long have they been a redditor?**

That aside, I think Academy Sports & Outdoors Inc $ASO has the potential to snag a participation trophy in the short squeeze special olympics.

[Short Interest](www.fintel.io/ss/us/aso) is high at 20% and this company sits at around $23. However, based on revenue of 4.83B last year and about 89M shares outstanding, it should be valued in the range of $54 a share.

After wiping the cream out of my undies after my $EXPR calls mooned, I took this position:

It's still under $15, less than half its ATH of $35.

GME hit $380 today, up *six times* its all time high of $63. That ridiculous price jump is going to scare away non-autist retail investors, and at that price, new buyers will be expending multiples more capital for the same upward pressure. I'm willing to bet that most of the diamond hang gang are in GME up to their tits and now going through their mothers' purse for more capital.

Also, #saveAMC is already trending, while people are *actively looking* for a new GME they feel they missed the boat on.

Despite how low the price already was, it has a record number of shorts - over 38 million, meaning another short squeeze is on the menu.

AMC has raised a billion dollars to weather out coronavirus, they have a ""Safe & Clean"" push, and they are going to be throwing out deals to everyone for them to come see the blockbusters that Hollywood has been sitting on after watching Tenet and WW1984 eat shit on streaming:

Coronavirus, the main cause for AMC's big downturn, is on the way out as vaccines will be available to all by spring, just ahead of summer blockbuster season.

Brick and mortar game stores *will* have less of a future, with or without coronavirus. There is no way to mount a 20 foot screen in your house. Unless, of course, you buy AMC stock now.

Here's the 200 shares I bought *yesterday* for the pittance of under a grand. I'm buying *a lot* more today.

Alright fellow Autists and Autits - here's the nitty gritty: **Wall Street is scared SHITLESS** today with all the retail buying in **NOK**. This may very well be GME 2.0 - *not* because of the short interest, but because of the blatant manipulation attempts by using Halts. Here is why they are scared...

**530 MILLION shares traded**

As of the time of this post, 530 MILLION shares have traded today compared to a meager 65 million shares traded daily on average. That's nearly 10x the usual daily volume!!! This volume shows our WSB army is strong and they are scrambling in fear!!!! (Hope they wore their brown pants)

**NOK making new highs at $8.81**

At the time of this post, NOK is currently trading at $6.67, down from the ATH of $8.81! It would be trading higher if it weren't for the volatility halts - MM's attempts at keeping price low. But we will not relent!!!

**Gamma Squeeze Incoming!**

\- Here's where things get extra extra spicy!!! Jan 29 Call Options only go up to a $8 strike. This morning, Open Interest was a staggering 150,345 contracts - of which 127,301 contracts are currently ITM!!!!

\- In ADDITION to the Open Interest, 278,065 moar contracts have traded today!!

\- As of right now, it is estimated that if price hits $7 by Friday, 408,777 contracts will be IN THE FUCKING MONEY which translates to an additional **40,877,000 SHARES that will need to be bought for option holders this FRIDAY**.

**tl;dr NOK looks very very ripe and tasty for a Gamma Squeeze this Friday which may drive shares up even further!**

**Obligatory:** I am but a fellow Autist and thus not an investment professional, and this is not to be considered investment advice.

**EDIT:** Shares needed to purchase by Friday corrected. I'm an obvious autist and shouldn't be trading but wtf do I know?!?!?"|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093318.csv|StockTicker|['NOK', 'RIDAY']|['NOK']|['S', 'DO', 'OUR', 'PART', 'PVOTE', 'FOR', 'OUR', 'ELLOW', 'TISTS', 'TO', 'GME', 'LLION', 'LLION', 'WSB', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'ATH', 'ITM', 'ITION', 'IN', 'THE', 'CKING', 'MONEY', 'HARES', 'NOK', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK']

I've been here since 2016 and I've seen some fucked up shit. I have even been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stonk Disorder (PTSD).

Some of you are up 200, 300, 400% on your GME positions right now, and still holding. I commend you for your diamond sacks, but lets not underestimate how evil, greedy, and cunning, big money can be.

Short interest is around 98% last I looked at the Ortex data a few hours ago.

#NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH OF THE CURRENT SHORT POSITIONS WERE OPENED AT THESE NEW LEVELS

At this point, all of the original shorts who were deeply underwater, have covered and gotten out. There is no doubt about that. Why does it matter?

These new shorts which were opened at current levels ARE NOT GOING TO MATTER AS MUCH UNLESS WE GET ANOTHER HUGE MOVEMENT UPWARD. And at this point, honestly ask yourself, what is the catalyst? Every retail investor has already heard about this and bought in, if they were going to. It's not like millions of normies are going to be pouring in to help push the price up to fuck the next level of shorts and cause another squeeze. 

I hate to break it to everyone, but the squeeze people were talking about 2 weeks ago ***HAS ALREADY HAPPENED***.

Is it possible another squeeze on these new short positions could happen? ***ABSOFUCKINGLUTELY***, However..

At this point, what is going to set this thing off? The Ryan Cohen news combined with a swarm of retards on here going all in is what triggered the first squeeze. Then we had news coverage, Elon and Chamath tweeting as the cherry on top. Is it possible that Ryan Cohen drops some big news within the next week or so to pop off short squeeze round 2? Sure. Is it possible some big whale comes along and decides to pump it and fuck the next round of shorts? Sure. But what im saying is, we already got a round of catalysts that were highly unlikely. It is not likely to get any better than we already got. 

#IF YOU ARE UP OVER 100% IT MAY BE TIME TO CALL IT. THERE IS A VERY GOOD CHANCE THAT WE WILL NOT GET ANOTHER BIG CATALYST TO SET OFF SHORT SQUEEZE ROUND TWO. Big money is doing shady shit, there is all sorts of manipulations going on, and just like we saw with the VW squeeze, this will come back down to earth, eventually. If you think GME is still going to be over 300 in a few weeks, you are fucking high. 

I don't know what else to say at this point. There's almost no DD going on here at this point. Every normie and their mother knows whats going on with GME. It's no longer a secret, you aren't getting in early at this point, and some of you are going to be surprised when it comes out that this big short squeeze you hoped for isnt coming because MM, big banks, and big money hedge funds LIED and did shady shit behind the scenes to prevent it.

I guarantee you Chamath closed out his small position already. Michael Burry also has and he even tweeted yesterday about how current levels are concerning. Last but not least, some of you seem to be under the impression that u/DeepFuckingValue is still holding because he thinks it's going to keep going up to 10k. ***He's holding still because it's been his baby for over a year now, he already pulled out a life changing amount of money so he probably doesn't care if it goes back down to 60, and lastly, he's holding as a fuck you to Melvin and company.*** This guy has balls of steel, I wouldn't be surprised if he held until expiration just to prove a point. I don't think this is about money to him anymore, and I don't think its wise or appropriate to interpret his refusal to sell as a sign of conviction in the current price levels, let alone a future price level of $1000.

Lastly, for those of you who have made 100+% returns in just a few days, do you really want to risk it? You realize this is a once in a lifetime event. You will never get this chance again, and if something happens and this thing comes back to earth, you will ***NEVER FORGIVE YOURSELF FOR NOT WALKING AWAY WHEN YOU WERE UP 300% on fucking SHARES ALONE***. ***YOU WILL HATE YOURSELF FOR BEING GREEDY, JUST LIKE MELVIN GOT GREEDY.***.

#SOME OF YOU HAVE WON THE GAME! YOU WON! NOW YOURE JUST TRYING TO RUB DIRT IN THE LOSING TEAMS FACE. EVEN IF THEY DESERVE IT, (WHICH THEY DO) WE NEED TO CONSIDER THAT THIS ISNT GOING TO LAST FOREVER, AND IT MIGHT BE TIME TO CALL IT IF YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO MAKE A 100, 200, 300% RETURN IN 2 FUCKING DAYS.

#No, I am not a bot you fucking idiot, look at my post history.

#Yes, I got out of my GME position earlier today. My total return on GME since last week is 460%. I am happy with that and I am not going to be DUPED into holding by bots and 500k new traders who have no experience and are just bandwagoning space ship emojis. I know better. When the normies flow in, I flow out. 

Good luck and god speed brothers."|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093320.csv|StockTicker|['T', 'BE', 'TUPID', 'IT', 'MAY', 'BE', 'TIME', 'TO', 'CALL']|[]|['I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'OBODY', 'KNOWS', 'HOW', 'MUCH', 'OF', 'THE', 'RRENT', 'SHORT', 'TIONS', 'WERE', 'PENED', 'AT', 'THESE', 'NEW', 'EVELS', 'ARE', 'NOT', 'GOING', 'TO', 'ATTER', 'AS', 'MUCH', 'NLESS', 'WE', 'GET', 'OTHER', 'HUGE', 'EMENT', 'PWARD', 'I', 'HAS', 'READY', 'IF', 'YOU', 'ARE', 'UP', 'OVER', 'IT', 'MAY', 'BE', 'TIME', 'TO', 'CALL', 'IT', 'THERE', 'IS', 'A', 'VERY', 'GOOD', 'HANCE', 'THAT', 'WE', 'WILL', 'NOT', 'GET', 'OTHER', 'BIG', 'ALYST', 'TO', 'SET', 'OFF', 'SHORT', 'UEEZE', 'ROUND', 'TWO', 'VW', 'GME', 'I', 'DD', 'GME', 'MM', 'LIED', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'NEVER', 'RGIVE', 'RSELF', 'FOR', 'NOT', 'LKING', 'AWAY', 'WHEN', 'YOU', 'WERE', 'UP', 'HARES', 'YOU', 'WILL', 'HATE', 'RSELF', 'FOR', 'BEING', 'REEDY', 'JUST', 'LIKE', 'ELVIN', 'GOT', 'REEDY', 'SOME', 'OF', 'YOU', 'HAVE', 'WON', 'THE', 'GAME', 'YOU', 'WON', 'NOW', 'YOURE', 'JUST', 'RYING', 'TO', 'RUB', 'DIRT', 'IN', 'THE', 'OSING', 'TEAMS', 'FACE', 'EVEN', 'IF', 'THEY', 'SERVE', 'IT', 'WHICH', 'THEY', 'WE', 'NEED', 'TO', 'SIDER', 'THAT', 'THIS', 'ISNT', 'GOING', 'TO', 'LAST', 'REVER', 'AND', 'IT', 'MIGHT', 'BE', 'TIME', 'TO', 'CALL', 'IT', 'IF', 'YOU', 'HAVE', 'READY', 'BEEN', 'LUCKY', 'NOUGH', 'TO', 'MAKE', 'A', 'ETURN', 'IN', 'CKING', 'DAYS', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'DUPED', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

I‚Äôm long on both tickers, but they‚Äôre just not the perfect storm that is GME 

It‚Äôs a war, not a battle. You buy your shares in GME now. It sucks you missed the runup to $50, it sucks you missed the runup to $100, and it really sucks to miss the runup to $300. But you know what will feel good? When you unload your shares onto Melvin‚Äôs backside

I read this company is valued at $700M now, but its factories costs over $3.5B. Company was on its way to bankruptcy because of trade war with China, but now has new contracts - their partner Sila Tech just raised $590 yesterday and Biden is literally raising this company from the dead!

They secured deals with Violet Power (Charlie Gay is CEO, this mofo big on ranks, search him up) and Group 14. Their other partner is Sila Nanotechnologies.

&#x200B;

With Biden as president and all the gay shit he¬¥s doing with bought in usa made in usa bla bla bla, this thing is gonna rocket off the moon. If you read their website ([www.recsilicon.com](https://www.recsilicon.com)) they are world leading and have unique techonology and patents. They are also extremely enviormently friendly, and with all this focus with Biden on enviornment, this shits going to blow.

This is only for stock bros. No options on gay ass scandinavian exchange. It has literally zero volume in US exchange (RNEWF ticker name), but this is going to blow up I think. U must buy it from Oslo Stock Exchange.

GME AMC NOKIA ETC all are good gainz, but there is risk. I think this one is going to blow the fuck up because its undervalued, contracts are coming, they are also the only company in all of USA and EU that provides silisium and silane (polysilicon). They got new major owners (Aker, Kjell Inge R√∏kke one of noirways richest) who are investing heavy. Company was valued at over $20billion in 2007, todays value is measly $700M. 

&#x200B;

They have three factories. One in Butte. One in Moses Lake and one in Yulin China. Butte is going to post best report ever, ML is going to get reopened and Yulin is going great.

&#x200B;

This is the way bros. Its time to invest in penny stocks that will give us several thousand % GAINZ! CUZ green is here to stay and since there is no one like this company in all of USA! Thank me later.

2) Ongoing discussions over market regulations are happening behind closed doors between lawmakers, the SEC, and top brokerage firms/money managers

3) The current narrative is that GME is a story about ordinary Joe Retail taking on Wall Street greed and corruption- the Chamath interview solidified that. The public is on the side of Retail at this moment. Any attempts to introduce regulations to limit the activities of retail traders would receive significant public backlash.

4) An effort between top lawmakers and mainstream media is fomenting to change the narrative. 

5) Mainstream media outlets will begin solely blaming wsb for the GME debacle, they will begin to paint us as a ‚Äúfringe group‚Äù, they will dig up whatever posts they can to try and portray us as radical, alt-right, racist, etc. They will accuse us of coordinating an effort to deliberately destroy hedge funds, although they will not say the word hedge fund, they will say we have caused major losses in the pension and retirement portfolios of retirees, veterans, police and firefighters, teachers, etc Public perception will flip on wsb. 

6) regulations will be introduced. The general public will accept these regulations and blame wsb for them. 

7) Wall Street greed and corruption thrives while our meme stock gainz languish 

Please pass the message! If you have ever posted anything on WSb That can be used by the media to falsely paint us as a group of radicals or undesirables, delete it!

We all need to continue this fight. GME is a company that has a plan and a new face in Ryan Cohen. If GME can make it out of this, this share price is here to stay. Look at the valuations of other retail companies with significant e-commerce revenue, GME has significant room to go up from here! Hold strong.

It's been awhile.

I'm asking us to stay united on these 2 fronts. DO NOT SELL ANY OF THEM. Simply buy more GME and BB. Do not let the bots divide us. We can work together and make big profits. The plan has always been GME -> BB.

Disproportionately selling any one of these 2 can cause one of the shares to suddenly collapse and can lead to an influx in the other one. This can lead to a lot of innocent WSBers losing out on gains during the pandemic. We need this rise to be stable. If you want to buy either of these shares, DO NOT SELL THE OTHER ONE. Sell your Yugioh cards, your kids, your body...but DO NOT SELL EITHER GME OR BB.

Thanks. :)

I am not a great financial analyst but if you look at what happened with and Tilary, I believe we are just in the initial phases. Mervin and Citron might be two common names but there are several others fund short on the stock.

Retail, as well as a desire to milk other short stocks, might have accelerated the process. But it took almost 2 months (mid Aug - mid Oct)  for TLRY to rise and shorts were paying an interest of 500-600% at one time. Even with dilution as rightly pointed out by someone in another post we have a chance of significant upside if insiders do not sell. Ultimately, I believe there are other players (big funds) in the field who will also try to make money at the expense of the shorts... we are small fish but everyone's appetite is different

What a time to be alive. 

 *""Bulls make money, bears make money,* ***pigs get slaughtered****""* 

How ironic, that one of the most iconic sayings in investing, was coined by Wall Street itself. Right now, pigs are getting slaughtered, and crying for someone to blame.

**I want you guys to really think about this:**

Every investment you make, comes with inherit risks and rewards. These hedge funds, who shorted 130%+ of the GME float, took a MASSIVE FUCKING RISK. They beat this stock down to a pulp, and instead of taking out their profits (like bears), they got greedy (like fucking pigs) and continued to increase their short.

They are literally affecting peoples lives. Those who work at Gamestop. They wanted this to go completely bankrupt. Oh, and who's going to bail out the average joe? Who bails out Jim, who works behind the counter at Gamestop?

NO ONE.

But who bails out these hedge funds? Fucking think about it. Melvin Capital gets a 3bn bailout, because they took a HUGE FUCKING RISK, and got caught on the losing end. 

Also, lets talk about risk for a second.

These hedge fund and institutions took a big risk that didnt pan out. Okay, not a big deal. they can just take the L and move on. But no. They doubled down, and you get articles now BLAMING THE RETAIL INVESTOR FOR MANIPULATION. 

So let me ask you this:

1. they took a huge risk on a bet
2. they are losing the bet
3. instead of being on the receiving end of the loss, they blame others for the situation that they're in

If you take a huge risk, and you KNOW that there is a chance of a loss, and that loss occurs, the only reason why you would start blaming others and finding excuses, is because there is an inherit FLAW in the system.

Melvin and other shorts knew, that there was no way something like this could happen. Why? Because they have the instruments to manipulate you and your emotions, through BS articles, analysts, and mass media.

TLDR:

1. Shorts shorted 130%, took a huge risk and lost
2. instead of taking the L, they're blaming YOU for manipulating the market"|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093251.csv|StockTicker|['GME', 'GTFO']|['GME']|['I', 'GME', 'SSIVE', 'CKING', 'RISK', 'NO', 'ONE', 'HUGE', 'CKING', 'RISK', 'L', 'AMING', 'THE', 'ETAIL', 'ESTOR', 'FOR', 'ATION', 'KNOW', 'FLAW', 'BS', 'L', 'YOU']|['GME']

THESE ARE FUDDERS TRYING TO GET IN CHEAPER OR EXIT POSITIONS. THE HYPE IS REAL**

Nokia is now a market leader in networking and enterprise level technology, essentially providing infrastructure for all types of networks. They also manufacture telecommunications equipment and engage in licensing. The most exciting opportunity in their current business model is 5G, which could be the main catalyst for this seemingly boring stock to finally break through resistance and become a valuable asset in portfolios. I'll give some key updates and price targets below.¬†


Partnerships and beneficiary of 5G rollouts


For starters, it's been a common thesis that 5G will be the greatest investing opportunity of the decade, yet Nokia remains in a flat/downward pattern on the chart. They've recently earned several contracts that will give them a stronger moat in the 5G domain as well as steady revenues and growth opportunities. Recent contracts come from a very diverse group of partners, including:¬†

-A 5 year deal with T-Mobile, in which T-Mobile will power it's 2.5GHz mid-band spectrum using Nokia's AirScale Radio platform. In addition, Nokia will facilitate T-Mobile to upgrade it's mid-band LTE network to a 5G network.¬†

-Secured a government contract via the¬†National Cybersecurity Center for Excellence. Nokia was selected as the tech provider and collaborator for the 5G Cybersecurity Project. The federal agency plans to utilize Nokia's technology for the transition to 5G from 4G. The project intends to identify 5G use cases to highlight the efficacy of the components of 5G architecture against security threats as part of a government initiative to beef up it's cyber security and anti-spying tools.

-Partnership with Google Cloud¬†in which the 2 firms will work in unison on businesses' digital transformation at the network edge through both 5G connectivity and cloud-native applications and capabilities. The partnership's purpose is to develop solutions for communication service providers to modernize network infrastructure and ensure smooth transitions to cloud-native 5G-core. This will likely build an ecosystem of services that deployable anywhere, from network edge, to public clouds, private clouds, and carrier networks.¬†

-Nokia has also recently announced¬†partnerships with M1¬†for 5G solutions in Singarpore, as well as¬†TeleZ¬†to deploy key infrastructure solutions for TeleZ subsribers in Sweden, Lativa, Lithuania, and Estonia. They were also awarded a contract by NASA for $14.1 million to build 4G infrastructure on the moon.¬†


Nokia has more than 220 large enterprise customers across industries worldwide, of which at least 30 have deployed 5G. They were also in a geopolitical battle in which the U.S. expressed interest in owning a piece of the company, and in response Finland built it's stake in Nokia via Solidium Oy, the state's equity-asset manager, to 1 billion euros($1.2b usd). Nokia also intends to repurchase 500 million shares in the coming months, so demand for the stock is picking up on all levels.¬†


In addition to infrastructure, licensing is a huge part of Nokia's business model that will benefit from 5G. The ""Nokia Technologies"" Arm handles patent licensing, technology licensing, and brand licensing. This includes an industry-leading patent portfolio including ~20,000 patent families including ~3500 5G standard essential patent families.¬†


So why is a company with so many valuable assets and recently announced deals/partnerships still trading flat and so seemingly undervalued? The short answer is the former CEO made several bad choices which gave Nokia's competitors an upper hand on the current 5G landscape and put NOK share price in a long term downtrend which has gave it a reputation as a boring stock with an ugly chart. However, with new CEO Pekka Lundmark's expertise in driving returns to shareholders, as well as the scrutiny and subsequent bans of Huawei opening the door for competition, Nokia now has a much needed breath of life and a chance to gain market share to become the biggest beneficiary of the 5G revolution. The new CEO is determined to get Nokia to the top and pull in solid returns to shareholders, as evidenced by the slew of recent contracts/partnerships along with his plans for spending aggressively on R&D, as well as developing a leaner business model by cutting unnecessary expenses and unprofitable endeavors.¬†


Nokia is primed for growth as they plan into several emerging, high growth markets including 5G, IoT, Edge computing, Network Encryption, Cloud Radio Access, Software Defined Infrastructure(SDI), Cloud Managed LAN, Optical Communications and Networking, as well as established high growth markets such as Smart Wearables, Defense/Security, and LTE.¬†



Despite the slew of positive news surrounding Nokia and their partnerships/contracts, the stock is still very undervalued, even at today's price surge. 

That may soon change, as the stock's chart is beginning to signal incoming volatility. The implied volatility(IV) and volume for NOK call options are indicating big moves in the coming months. Open interest is on the rise as well.¬†




NOK is trading at a¬†Price/Book ratio¬†of¬†1.3x, compared to it's peers average of¬†4.0x¬†and the sector average¬†2.2x¬†

NOK is also undervalued in terms of¬†Price/LTM sales. It has a ratio of¬†0.9x, it's peers trade at an average of¬†3.9x, and the sector average of¬†1.8x

To establish the Fair Value Estimate, we'll use 2 models taking input from previous NOK financials, as well as data from competitors. (Competitors include: CSCO, ERIC, MSI, MSFT, and AAPL.

P/E Multiples:¬†$14.94¬†target¬†

Earnings Power Value:¬†$15.64¬†target¬†

The average for the 2 models imply a¬†Fair Value Estimate¬†of¬†$15.29 




These estimates are based on historical data, therefore are fair values for the current price and past performance, not taking into account the market share and recurring revenue recently secured. I believe over the 3 months ad beyond the fair value will be much higher as earnings begin to reflect the value and growth from 5G contracts and recurring revenues.¬†


Even currently, those estimates are a bit low as Nokia's closest competitor, Ericsson, has a market cap that is nearly 70% higher than Nokia, despite the two having very similar financials and even trailing Nokia in several key metrics.¬†



At NOK's current share price of, it remains undervalued as ERIC is only ahead of NOK in 2 key categories, EBITDA and Profit Margin, and ERIC is only outperforming NOK by a slim margin in these categories. I believe NOK should be valued much higher, than ERIC since they are gaining contracts MUCH faster than ERIC and also Huawei, which would imply a share price of¬†$7.11¬†before any buybacks place shares into the treasury, which would increase the price even further.¬†


Nokias Fair value is over $25

This is based on competitor ERIC who is valued 68.4% higher despite having trailing NOK in almost every key metric for valuation, and the valuation of Huawei who is losing tons of revenue and contracts in favor of Nokia"|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093315.csv|StockTicker|['$NOK', 'A']|['NOK']|['DO', 'NOT', 'ISTEN', 'TO', 'EOPLE', 'AYING', 'NOK', 'HYPE', 'ARE', 'BOTS', 'THESE', 'ARE', 'DDERS', 'RYING', 'TO', 'GET', 'IN', 'EAPER', 'OR', 'EXIT', 'TIONS', 'THE', 'HYPE', 'IS', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'A', 'LTE', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'Z', 'Z', 'NASA', 'G', 'G', 'U', 'S', 'G', 'G', 'CEO', 'G', 'NOK', 'CEO', 'G', 'CEO', 'D', 'G', 'T', 'LAN', 'LTE', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'LTM', 'NOK', 'CSCO', 'ERIC', 'MSI', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'E', 'I', 'G', 'ERIC', 'NOK', 'BITDA', 'ERIC', 'NOK', 'I', 'NOK', 'ERIC', 'MUCH', 'ERIC', 'ERIC', 'NOK']|['NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'LTM', 'NOK', 'CSCO', 'ERIC', 'MSI', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'ERIC', 'NOK', 'ERIC', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'ERIC', 'ERIC', 'ERIC', 'NOK']

One argument that will be made is that it's not fair that we made so much money by recognizing that a group of hedge funds and institutions were in over their heads. It hurts the market and we should feel bad for exploiting them.

The total market cap of $GME is around $12B as I'm writing this. **The total market cap of Wall Street is around $50T.** That means we've currently displaced about .025% of the total value of the US stock market. I will type that out to reiterate: we (retail traders) have displaced approximately one quarter of one tenth of one percent of the total market cap. To claim that we are doing anything which is tremendously harmful to the whole market is absolutely pants-on-fire lies. Is this going to change some elements of the market moving into the future? Almost certainly. But even if this stock goes to $1000 per share, we are still only talking about less than one tenth of one percent of the total market cap that's out there. 

If you're looking at your RH balance right now  and thinking ""wow, that's a lot of money, am I doing something wrong? Illegal, even?"" the answer is **ABSOLUTELY NOT.** What you are beginning to notice is that the wealth gap in this country is absolutely massive. Thousands upon thousands of people could make year changing or life changing money out of this squeeze and it'll hardly be a blip on Wall Street's radar. Greed is absolutely out of control at the top and this funny little news story is tangible proof of that. Do not let them gaslight you into thinking that it's wrong for you to get a slightly larger sliver of the pie. 

Good luck to everyone playing this. I've got 100 shares at a cost basis of $103.95. I might not make millions, but I might be able to make a dent in my student loans, or pay off my car, or something that makes me just a little more hopeful that I'll be able to live some sort of ""American Dream"" before I'm old and wrinkled.

edit: and in the event that you're literally brand new to trading (we're getting a lot of new people here), I would highly encourage you to read up on investment basics (there are literally millions of resources on this) and do some research into $GME and why it's moving the way it is. I would not recommend taking a position on any stock if you can't articulate your own reason as to why you're invested in it."|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093229.csv|StockTicker|['$GME']|['GME']|['$GME', '$GME', 'B', 'T', 'US', 'I', 'RH', 'I', 'UTELY', 'NOT', 'I', 'I', 'I', '$GME', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Before you autists get all frothy at me, I'm not telling anyone to give up their üíéüôå. The beauty of stocks is that you can own more than one.

AMC opened today at 4x the price, after trending up for days. It bounced around half its ATH of $35, before closing at 300% gain for the day.

GME hit $380 today, up six times its all time high of $63. The current GME price scares away non-autist retail investors, and at that price, new buyers will be expending multiples more capital for the same upward pressure.

If you don't believe me, look at the numbers. As GME is hitting mainstream and is the big hotness on this sub, AMC also outperformed GME by 165% by close today.

Also, #saveAMC is already trending as it gains traction across social media. People are actively looking for a new GME they feel they missed the boat on.

Despite how low the price already was, it has a record number of shorts: over 38 million. This means another short squeeze isn't just on the menu - it's already starting. It's the third most shorted stock out there, despite its clearly viable future. This doesn't distract from GME's slaughter of hedge funds because it's the next wave of their an hero.

AMC has raised a billion dollars to weather out coronavirus, amid an ongoing ""Safe & Clean"" push. Some studios like WB are moving to parallel releases on HBO Max, but AMC is already throwing out deals to get people in the door. Meanwhile, Hollywood has been sitting on blockbusters after watching Tenet and WW1984 eat shit on streaming:

Their debt/equity ratio has also been trending positively, even as coronavirus has intensified. Just a return to the mean suggests ridiculous gain, even ignoring the likelihood of pent-up demand. AMC has legs not just for the next week, but for the next few quarters.

Coronavirus, the main cause for AMC's big downturn, is on the way out as vaccines will be available to all by spring, just ahead of summer blockbuster season.

In the long term, after hedge fund shorters lose their ass on GME, brick and mortar game stores will have less of a future, with or without coronavirus. It's easier to digitally download games, and hardware can be bought online and received the next day from any number of retailers. There's no way to mount a 20 foot screen in your house. Unless, of course, you buy AMC stock now.

You have your iPod touch and you just downloaded iFunny. Not the shit iFunny that still exists on your phone even though you haven't opened it in 8 years. I am talking about the unfiltered cesspool of memes and edgy shit that you spent hours scrolling through wondering if you were going to see some quality content or a bunch of porn and shitposts. Finally, you find what you were looking for. A picture of the Nokia 3310 and a clever caption about dropping it and breaking the floor or toilet or whatever unfortunate surface it lands on. It was gold. Fucking comedy gold. The definition of a meme. Flash forward a few years. You are in your early teens and iFunny has since been cleaned up. It just doesn't do it for you anymore.

JPM just paid $1 billion fine for their manipulation and they brushed it off and kept doing it. The other post didn‚Äôt say how to cause the squeeze, here‚Äôs how to play it|t3_l6fgbn|0.98|3235|3235|top|2021-01-28 00:55:29.000000|TheHappyHawaiian|467|DD|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6fgbn/the_other_post_about_slv_is_absolutely_correct/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6fgbn/the_other_post_about_slv_is_absolutely_correct/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6fgbn/the_other_post_about_slv_is_absolutely_correct/|"First here is the other post https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the_biggest_short_squeeze_in_the_world_slv_silver/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf

Second, everyone buy and hold GME through at least $1000 before buying silver because the shorts are still at 139% of the float so there is a technical reason to stay long until they really cover.

Third, the other post said to buy miners, but that won‚Äôt cause a silver squeeze. The miners will benefit from the squeeze, but buying miners alone does nothing to actually beat the manipulating banks at their own game in silver.

So here‚Äôs how you do it:

Buy SLV directly.  If you want options buy in the money or near the money to force true hedging (buying) by the market maker.  This is a very old and slower moving market than equities so unless you are buying leaps, SLV shares are the way to go anyways.  Alternatively, buy silver physically or even force delivery through purchasing futures if you are rich and can store it.  Physical silver purchases carry a premium over spot price though so you end up causing more physical silver to be purchased by simply buying SLV.

By purchasing SLV, more shares will be created and SLV will have to purchase massive amounts of physical silver to hold in their vaults because the etf has to remain backed by physical silver.  

Silver is a much larger market than GME, but the paper traded gold market is 100x the physical market.  If we force more physical purchase and delivery of silver, the paper traders will be required to buy it in real life and deliver it. Creating a positive feedback loop just like a short squeeze.

Lastly, the fundamental case is that government stimulus combined with fed money and reopening economy will cause inflation, and that government debt loads mean dollar debasement. Lest someone say we are manipulating the market (as big banks have literally been doing for decades). We like the stock!

Let‚Äôs get GME to the moon and then park all of the winnings in SLV. Could take a couple of months to fully moon as delivery of silver takes time but it really could go to $1000 from $25.  If GME took down a single hedge fund, this would take down JPM. 

Please share, it‚Äôs hard to break through right now 

Power and tendies to people!

We've got so many comments and submissions that we can't possibly even read them all, let alone act on them as moderators. We wrote software to do most of the moderation for us but that software isn't allowed to read the Reddit new feed fast enough and submit responses, and the admins haven't given us special access despite asking for it.

We're suffering from success and our Discord was the first casualty. You know as well as I do that if you gather 250k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad. That room was golden and the people that run it are awesome. We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you don't get to hang out with your friends anymore. Discord did us dirty and **I am not impressed with them destroying our community** instead of stepping in with the wrench we may have needed to fix things, especially after we got over 1,000 server boosts. That is pretty unethical.

To add to this, people are co-opting our name on twitter. I won't mention their accounts, but lots of handles with ""wsb"" and ""wallstreetbets"" in them are pretending to speak for us. They're saying things that we don't agree with, driving traffic to derivative communities and shitty pixelated merch stores, and generally making it harder for us to define who we are. There's also too much political bullshit in a community that was never *ever* political. The only way I want to occupy Wall St is in a suit myself or rent-free in the mind of a blown up short.

That is why I'm throwing my support behind the Twitter handle in general. We need a way to PUBLICLY reach out to the staff of the infrastructure that is failing us so the world can see that we aren't doing anything wrong here if they don't respond. We need to be able to respond directly to a reporter that is lying to the world about our clubhouse. We can't be expected to meet any expectations when we aren't given the tools we need.

That's not to say I approve of every message or will even be in the loop for all of them, but it's clear to me we can't do nothing and we need a megaphone.

**http://twitter.com/wsbmod** aka **@wsbmod** is the only Twitter handle whose statements are directly from some part of the team.

If not change it.

I wrote this in response to someone elsewhere who asked simply:

> So they're betting against the company? Like, they have no faith in them? Investing like this makes one feel horrible.

Yeah. There are three ways you can short.

--- 

1) You buy an option with a predetermined end date with the RIGHT to sell a stock at a certain price (depending on how much you want to pay determines the price.) If a stock is $10 and you expect it to drop to $5 in 6 months, you might buy a $9, 10 month expiry ""put"" (right to sell at price) option. This might cost you 50c per share. 

IF you're even slightly right, ie it drops to any price lower than $8.49 before expiry you made 1c per share. You can also change your mind and sell the option (either more (profit) or less (loss) than 50c/share).

IF you're properly right, and it does drop to exactly $5 you make $3.5 per share. If it rises, or drops to any number above $8.50, you lose the price of the option (50c/share). 

---

2) You're a big player. You call your buddies at Pension Fund X42 and say ""Hey can I borrow those shares you have for x% interest and return them to you later?"" A set timeframe may be set. I don't know for sure, but probably. Anyhow, Pension Fund X42 says ""ok"" because they aren't looking to sell them, so might as well make some interest on lending them. 

So you borrow them, and immediately sell them. You pay your daily interest to the pension fund, and you wait. When the price drops, and you decide that you've made enough, you buy them back and return them. You keep the difference in prices whatever that may be, minus the interest.

If you're wrong... You're still obliged to return the shares to Pension Fund X42. So at some point you have to decide to eat a loss and buy the shares back. 

---

3) You're a big player and you are ok with a bit of lawbreaking, you Naked Short Sell. This is great because it's cheaper! No interest payments! 

Here, you simply sell shares you don't have, and buy the imaginary shares you just created back later so that the number of shares on issue doesn't get too far out of whack and you don't get investigated. Any gap between your sell price and buy price is profit or loss depending on which way it goes. 

---

What's happened right now is mostly a combination of 2 and 3. I'm sure there is a bit of 1, but 1 only causes predictable losses (Like the cost of playing a hand at a casino. You only lose the amount you bet if the cards don't go your way.)

So the risk with 2 and 3 is that because you're **obliged** to buy back the shares at some point, if they go up, when you have to quit, you have to pay the current market price and your actions can make the price go up even more. 

Now you're in a short squeeze. You are obliged to buy but the price keeps going up every time you do. It's entirely possible that others see the price going up and buy, so you're now competing to buy a limited number of shares with everyone else. So the price goes higher. Your losses are potentially infinite. 

---

**What's slightly different** between this particular short squeeze and all the others is:

---

1) The dumb fucks naked short sold AT LEAST 40% more shares than ever existed. They're obliged to buy back more shares than is possible. The only way out of that self-made trap is a complicated mess of desperately buying, returning, rebuying from the people you borrowed them from, and returning them with losses at every step. Imagine if I sold you 10 cars, but only delivered 6. You're standing there with your wtf face and I say ""Hey! how much would you sell those 4 cars for?"" You can name your price at this point. I pay it. Then I ""finish"" my ""10 car delivery.""

---

2) Retail traders are acting as one single semi-coordinated hive, loosely behaving similarly to what would in prior short squeezes, be a competitor hedge fund. They own a lot of the shares the hedge funds (HFs) NEED to buy - but they're not selling. They're actively cheering for the HFs bankruptcy while watching the price of the stock they hold skyrocket. Only other HF billionaires are allowed to do that and get away with it. 

.

2a) HFs can be negotiated with. If you're really, really getting bent over and fucked, and you grovel enough, you can usually cut a deal where they stop trying to fuck you. If they won't talk to you, they'll often talk to your bank/broker/some other bigger player that can convince them that your bankruptcy will also cause significant losses or bankruptcy of another party they're not trying to fuck and they might like to have as friends one day. ""You quit this, and we'll owe you one."" It's always good to have favours to call.

.

2b) The self proclaimed retards on WSB can't be negotiated with. They don't need favours. They don't care if you go bankrupt or there's collateral damage. They don't give a fuck about any of them. For the most part they only hold a few hundred shares each max - and also for the most part, they're playing with their own money that they can actually afford to lose even if it hurts for a year or two. 

How do you negotiate with, or swat a million wasps stinging you? You can't.

**Edit.**

Thanks for all the awards guys! I'll soon have enough to make a Tiara and become your –Øetard Prince for the day! I was actually expecting posts telling my how wrong I am. I only think I know what the fuck is going on most of the time and usually figure out later that it wasn't.

I'd like to thank the academy, and my parents who never believed in me, and Scruffy, my first dog, who, like WSB, played chicken with truck, and, and, and...

Also. 

I figure since this is so popular, I might as well nominate my suggestion for the inevitable u/deepfuckingvalue movie. It's fairly likely to be seen as a sequel to the Wolf of Wall St, so.... ""The Fox/Foxes of Main Street"" ? Yeah, nah?

The outrage, to attempt to save big money while saying its to protect us. He said we are vulnerable. He said we are too ""unsophisticated"" to understand our risks. He said that shorts at least are sophisticated. Its so stupid its laughable. As if we are simply children mashing buttons.

The brokers have given us commission-free trading. Reddit, twitter, etc. have given us a collective hive mind where ideas can be nurtured, critiqued, developed, distributed, and acted upon in concert.

However, the government, hedge funds, brokers, et. al. still practice their dirty tricks to protect their own. We should fear the systematic risk of cronyism within the halls of government and Wall Street to put the brakes on our profit making, which is our lawful American right.

Should the SEC illegally or unjustly intervene on behalf of their friends (who so often reward government poodle regulators with lucrative jobs after leaving civil service), we will need to find a large law firm that specializes in securities and class actions and is willing to setup a trust account where you give your name, nominal retainer fee, and proof that you owned $GME to establish standing in a suit.

The shorts have only themselves to blame. They were given life lines and extra capital to escape their positions. But instead they use that money and opportunity to double down. 

They call us names and make it seem like we are bandits, when in reality we are your brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles and so on. There is nothing malicious about liking a stock and buying and holding it. 

In fact, CNBC and other outlets encouraged the young generation to start investing and tell us the stock market is the greatest creation of wealth possible. 

But when we do, they don‚Äôt like us getting it right. They are the pool sharks at the table and they just want us to play to get our money. 

Hold strong in your convictions and if you‚Äôre in a certain stock remember why and do not let emotions take over. When you do, they win and you lose. And trust me when I say, we do not get a bail out.

#THE PLAN


After we're done mailing boxes labeled ""extra Jimmy shares"" full of peanut brittle snakes to Melvin's Syndicate of Stupidity HQ, I propose we buy out the contract of the wax-headed Seinfeld character on CNBC. We simply shave off 2% of our collective gains, make our offer to CNBC, and collect our Cramery spoils. 


From then on, we make him the WSB mascot. Dress him as a clown and rent him out for children's burthday parties. Make him wear a sandwich board reading ""beanie babies are crash-proof"" and have him stand outside the NYSE every day until he straight up expires from old age. Legally change his name to Jimmy ToMoon? By all means.


Me? I just wanna dress him in little sweaters and take him on walks. 


I want ideas on my desk by 4.

First a bit about me, I'm young and have been trading successfully with my own money for the last 2.5 years and am now retired. Thanks Elon.

With that out of the way, the beautiful thing about this movement is it's not a movement with any one representative point of view. It's more of a public gathering where if one person has an idea and it's well thought through, it gets upvoted and awarded. It's truly democratic and decentralized.

The GME phenomenon started exactly this way, when a few people including Michael Burry (Big Short fame) noticed that it was trading ridiculously below book value. Others on here took notice and believe it or not, did thorough due diligence (I encourage you to use the ""DD filter"" and see some of this, it's pretty incredible work) with financials laid out and then wrote posts about it. When Chewy founder Ryan Cohen took on a large position and became another activist investor with a grand new vision, more people on here noticed and saw not only and undervalued asset but one with actual explosive growth potential given the gaming sector growth.

Then people here took notice of the fact that 148% of the float was sold short (still a bit hazy on how this is legal) and did what Wall St. and the mainstream media didn't do, they looked and saw the audacity and greed of a few funds who thought they could never lose, were completely over leveraged and then acted on this public info and posted about it. More people here noticed and more people acted.

This is done everyday by hedge funds behind closed doors. The only thing we did differently is we did it out in the open and without inside information.

With that said, I have to respectfully decline to go on the air and be a representative of over 2.8 million members of Wallstreetbets, which by design, is not a coordinated movement and should not have a representative. I sincerely believe this and am not trying to be a hero or ""anti-establishment.""

I really appreciate you reaching out and I want you to feel free to use any of this for your segment but please make sure to stress that this is just the view of 1 out of 2.8 million people and not necessarily the views of the subreddit. I really think Fox Business has a once in a lifetime opportunity to cover the shift of market power from private to public and to differentiate itself from the hacks at CNBC.

Godspeed and make us proud!

GME finally brought me back to 100k today after holding for about a week, and I paper hands'ded and sold. I was just ecstatic to 'undo' the fuck-up that blew my account up. I am terrified of losing that money again, it's everything I've saved up since 2017.

I am glad the mods made this sub private earlier. ***I am seeing the true level of conviction of the REAL WSB OG's***. I am seeing that there was a lot of noise today, and that the people who have been here the longest, who have bled and fought with me through JNUG/JDST, through meme-ing AMD at $13, through TSLA squeeze, through a GLOBAL FUCKING PANDEMIC.. are still diamond handing this.

#I feel like I betrayed you guys today.

I seriously told myself after selling today that I was going to stay 100% cash until this all blew over. It's been hard to know what is really going on lately because of all the bots and astroturfing. But I have seen the level of conviction of the TRUE VETERAN AUTISTS of this sub and I am rejuvenated.

Although I can't afford to risk all of my money, ***I am not going to sit on the sidelines after the laughs, the panic, the joy, the loss, and the good times this sub has given me over the years.*** I honestly see you guys as friends, even if I don't see your faces, or know you on a personal level. And friends stick it out, through whatever bullshit life throws at them.

#TOMORROW I AM BACK IN. 5K WORTH OF SHARES, AND HOLDING UNTIL THE END. NO STOP LOSS, NO LIMIT SELL. FOR GLORY, OR FOR DEATH. I WILL STAND BY YOU BROTHERS.

Bit of background: I've been on this sub for years (was even a mod temporarily when /u/only1parkjisung modded a bunch of people for fun long, long ago), and I've been in the hedge fund world for about a decade (I'm a sell-side analyst; won't go into more detail than that as it isn't necessary). I mention all of this because I know both how this world works and how the hedge fund world works, which gives me a unique insight into what might happen next.

I won't make any predictions on GME, BB, or other stocks, because I don't think the squeeze's biggest risk right now is there. Rather, the biggest risk comes from what we've already seen happen over at Discord with the shutdown of the server. Note that Discord has had significant investment from private equity funds including FirstMark Capital, Greenoaks Capital Partners, Index Ventures, IVP, Greylock Partners, Benchmark, Accel, General Catalyst, Ridge Ventures, Spark Capital, and Tencent Holdings. At least one of these firms has invested with Point72 Ventures, which recently helped Melvin Capital. So it's not too surprising that strings were pulled to get the Discord channel banned for ""hate speech"" (which is a very useful brush to tar anyone with, as anyone who challenges it can easily be dismissed as a nazi).

Now, this subreddit's long history of using several slurs is an opportunity for the hedge fund world to claim it is a hate subreddit and pressure Reddit to get it closed. I recommend the r-word and f-word be banned by mods for this reason; yes I know it is stupid and, well, r-worded, but best to play the game and self censor rather than give these assholes a single in to destroy this community.

What is the risk of Reddit getting orders from owners to shut us down? At the moment, I'd say pretty low, but the bigger it gets the more there is that risk. Reddit is owned by Advance Publications, which is owned by Donald Newhouse and the Newhouse family (some details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Newhouse). Fortunately, Newhouse's family office (think a private hedge fund dedicated to investing just the family's money) is pretty far removed from the hedge fund world afaik. The family office's CIO (details here: https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1g6j2tztzpb3t/A-New-CIO-for-One-of-America-s-Richest-Families) got her career started in the investment bank world and did not work for hedge funds, at least according to her Linkedin profile. So the Donaldson family has limited motive to stick their necks out and force a ban of this subreddit.

However, it remains a risk and a very serious one. I suggest the mods work together to get some legal representation going; if Palihapitiya was serious about investing in the WSB community, I'd suggest putting some money aside for this and for compliance. A kickstarter fund would not be a good idea because of the ease with which bad faith arguments of collusion could be made.

In short, WSB is at the mercy of Reddit's admins, who are at the mercy of its executives, who are at the mercy of the owners. While WSB is making serious progress as a revolution against the billionaires, this is a very serious weakness that the Discord ban has exposed and that mods need to work on fixing asap."|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093234.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'BB', 'I', 'IVP', 'I', 'I', 'CIO', 'I', 'WSB', 'A', 'WSB', 'WSB']|['GME', 'CIO']

&#x200B;

Here's a couple key takeaways:

* Theoretically, the maximum amount of a company's float that could be shorted is equal to the float itself; although, in reality, it's rare for a stock to have a short interest greater than 50%.
* Short selling is an [advanced trading strategy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trading-strategy.asp) used by investors to speculate on an expected price decline of a stock or other [security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp).

Note that the fundamental here is that it shouldnt be above 50%üí∏üí∏üí∏ normally, let alone 100%. It shouldnt even be an idea under normal circumstances. We didnt create this non-fundamental scenario. They did.

Also note that shorting is called ""SPECULATION."" Speculation is not wise, well informed investingüòíüòí. They are betting and they always warn that it is betting. They warn non-stop that you should be very careful. They scare you away from these massive profit potentials and hide behind complex ideas.

Once they start losing, they suddenly change their tune üé∂üé∂. They claim we arent paying attention to fundamentals. That we are inexperienced and making dumb moves. This is the most shrewd, clever, intelligent market move made since the Big Short. The institutional investors got caught with their pants down üòò in public and blame us for calling them out on it.

This is the sub where people post graphs from March showing themselves 1000X'ing on Puts and then losing it all right back.  We get it more than you do CNBC.  We know there is risk.  Stop acting like you need to hold our hands and protect us.  That's bullshit.  None of you actually care, you're just upset that retail is absolutely killing it while your shitty portfolio is selling off.

What exactly are we risking anyways?  Most people on WSB are young with maybe a few $10K's in the bank.  We are the exact people who should be taking risks.  $10K invested in the stock market even over the next 30 years isn't gonna change your life.  These guys are flying around in private jets telling you to save for retirement so that you won't get kicked out of your shitty apartment at 65 years old.

This is a moment in history where billions of dollars have flowed from the rich to the poor.  Where it'll end up, who knows, but I guarantee that we'd rather play the game and take the loss if it happens than sit on the sidelines and play it safe.  The truth is that if you want to make it in this world, you have to take big ass risks.  The downside is usually overstated.

I have not sold my GME to buy SLV.  I had a small pre-existing position in leaps I bought months ago.

Here is the longer DD for the short squeeze case for SLV, a follow-up from my shorter post a few hours ago. Note that I talk in first person as this is something I‚Äôm going to do. Everyone is free to do as they individually please and copy my trade if they‚Äôd like to.  I think it‚Äôs absurd that forces at be think this forum is manipulating by posting publicly but that‚Äôs where we are at right now.

First things first, **I'm not doing this until the GME rise is done.** I am long GME but am going long SLV immediately after.

Update 1/29: due to the manipulation and collusion of citadel, hedge funds, and brokers to change the rules and rig the game in their favor. Who likely knew ahead of time and bought puts right before and calls at the bottom, GME is too important to abandon still. SLV is still my next play but GME needs to go to $1000 and these people need to go to jail.

**If you just want to know what to buy skip to the end**

I present 2 investment DDs in this post, the short squeeze and the fundamentals.  If you want to see what to buy

**The short squeeze:**

Buy SLV shares and SLV call options to force physical delivery of silver to the SLV vaults. Also buy physical silver bullion.  The best possible thing would be to take physical delivery in the futures market if you have access to do so.

The silver futures market has oscillated between having roughly 100-1 and 500-1 ratio of paper traded silver to physical silver, but lets call it 250-1 for now.  This means that for every  250 ounces in open interest in the futures market, only 1 actually gets delivered.  Most traders would rather settle with cash rather than take delivery of thousands of ounces of silver and have to figure out to store and transport it in the future.

The people naked shorting silver via the futures markets are a couple of large banks and making them pay dearly for their over leveraged naked shorts would be incredible.  It's not Melvin capital on the other side of this trade, its JP Morgan.  Time to get some payback for the bailouts and manipulation they've done for decades (look up silver manipulation fines that JPM has paid over the years).

The way the squeeze could occur is by forcing a much higher percentage of the futures contracts to actually deliver physical silver.  There is very little silver in the COMEX vaults or available to actually be use to deliver, and if they have to start buying en masse on the open market they will drive the price massively higher.  There is no way to magically create more physical silver in the world that is ready to be delivered.  With a stock you can eventually just issue more shares if the price rises too much, but this simply isn't the case here.  The futures market is kind of the wild west of the financial world.  Real commodities are being traded, and if you are short, you literally have to deliver thousands of ounces of silver per contract if the holder on the other side demands it.  If you remember oil going negative back in May, that was possible because futures are allowed to trade to their true value.  They aren't halted and that's what will make this so fun when the true squeeze happens.

Edit for more detail:  let‚Äôs say there‚Äôs one futures seller who gets unlucky and gets the buyer who actually wants to take delivery. He doesn‚Äôt have the silver and realizes it‚Äôs all of a sudden damn difficult to find some physical silver.  He throws up his hands and just goes long a matching number of futures contracts and will demand actual delivery on those. Problem solved because he has now matched the demanding buyer with a new seller.  The issue is that the new seller has the same issue and does the exact same thing.  This is how the cascade effect of a meltup occurs.  All the naked shorts trying to offload their position to someone who actually has some silver. My goal is to ensure that I have the silver and won‚Äôt sell to them until silver is at a far higher price due to the desperation.

The silver market is much larger than GME in terms of notional value, but there is very little physical silver actually readily available (think about the difference between total shares and the shares in the active float for a stock), and the paper silver trading hands in the futures market is hundreds of times larger than what is available.  Thus when they are forced to actually deliver physical silver it will create a massive short squeeze where an absurd amount of silver will be sought after (to fulfill their contractually obligated delivery) with very little available to actually buy.  They are naked shorting silver and will have to cover all at once and the float as a percentage of the total silver stock globally is truly miniscule.

**The fundamentals:**

The current gold to silver ratio is 73-1.  Meaning the price of gold per ounce is 73 times the price of silver.  Naturally occurring silver is only 18.75 times as common as gold, so this ratio of 73-1 is quite high.  Until the early 20th century, silver prices were pegged at a 15-1 ratio to gold in the US because this ratio was relatively known even then.  In terms of current production, the ratio is even lower at 8-1.  Meaning the world is only producing 8 ounces of silver for each newly produced ounce of gold.

Global industry has been able to get away with producing so little new silver for so long because governments have dumped silver on the market for 80 years, but now their silver vaults are empty.  At the end of WW2 government vaults globally contained 10 billion ounces of silver, but as we moved to fiat currency and away from precious metal backed currencies, the amount held by governments has decreased to only 0.24 billion ounces as they dumped their supply into the market. But this dumping is done now as their remaining supply is basically nil.

This 0.24 billion ounces represents only  8% of the total supply of only 3 billion ounces stored as investment globally.  This means that 92% of that gold is held privately by institutions and by millions of boomer gold and silver bugs who have been sitting on meager gains for decades.  These boomers aren't going to sell no matter what because they see their silver cache as part of their doomsday prepper supplies.  It's locked away in bunkers they built 500 miles from their house. Also, with silver at $23 an ounce currently, this means all of the worlds investment grade silver only has a total market cap of $70 billion.  For comparison the investment grade gold in the world is worth roughly $6 trillion. This is because most of the silver produced each year actually gets used, as I have mentioned.  $70 billion sounds like a lot, but we don‚Äôt have to buy all that much for the price to go up a lot.

\*\*If the squeeze happens, it would be like 40 years worth of their gains in 4 months \*\*

The reason that only 8 ounces of silver are produced for every 1 ounce of gold in today's world is because there aren't really any good naturally occurring silver deposits left in the world.  Silver is more common than gold in the earth's crust, but it is spread very thin.  Thus nearly every ounce of silver produces is actually a byproduct of mining for other metals such as gold or copper.  This means that even as the silver price skyrockets, it wont be easy to increase the supply of silver being produced.  Even if new mines were to be constructed, it could take years to come online.

Finally, most of this newly created silver supply each year is used for productive purposes rather than kept for investment.  It is used in electronics, solar panels, and jewelry for the most part. This demand wont go away if the silver price rises, so the short sellers will be trying to get their hands on a very small slice of newly minted silver.  The solar market is also growing quickly and political pressure to increase solar and electric vehicles could provide more industrial demand.

The other part of the story is the faster moving piece and that is the inflation and currency debasement fear portion.  The government and the fed are printing money like crazy debasing the value of the dollar, so investors look for real assets like precious metals to hide out in, driving demand for silver.  The $1.9 trillion stimulus passing in a month or two could be a good catalyst.  All this money combined with the reopening of the economy could cause some solid inflation to occur, and once inflation starts it often feeds on itself.

**What to buy:**

I will be putting **50% directly into SLV shares, and 50% into the $35 strike SLV calls expiring 4/16**.  This way the SLV purchase creates a groundswell into silver immediately that then rockets through a gamma squeeze as SLV approaches $35.  Price target of $75 for SLV by end of April if the short squeeze happens.

Edit: for the part of your purchases going into shares, some people recommend PSLV because they think SLV might start lying about having the silver in their vault. Or that the custodian will be double counting, ie claiming that the same silver belongs to multiple people (banking on the fact that people wont all try to get their silver at once).  So if you buy SLV shares and calls, that's great.  But I think it could be prudent for us to buy options in SLV (no options on PSLV) and shares in PSLV.  It all depends on how paranoid you want to be.  There is a lot of paranoia in the precious metals world.

Alternate options:

\- buying physical silver; this also works but you pay a premium to buy and sell so its less efficient and you take fewer silver ounces off of the market because of the premium you pay

\- going long futures for February or March; if you are a rich bastard and can actually take physical delivery of 1000s of ounces of silver by all means do so.  But if you simply settle for cash you are actually part of the problem.  We need actual physical delivery, which is what SLV demands and is why SLV is the way to go unless you are going to take delivery

\- miners; I don‚Äôt recommend buying miners as part of this trade.  Miners will absolutely go up if SLV goes up, but buying them doesn't create the squeeze in the actual silver market.  Furthermore, most silver miners only derive 30-50% of their revenue from silver anyways, so eventually SLV will outperform them as it gets high enough (and each marginal SLV dollar only increases miner profits by a smaller and smaller percentage)

**Details on SLV physical settlement:**

When SLV issues shares, the custodian is forced to true up their vaults with the proportional amount of silver daily.  From the SLV prospectus:

""An investment in Shares is:  Backed by silver held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust.  The Shares are backed by the assets of the Trust. The Trustee‚Äôs arrangements with the Custodian contemplate that at the end of each business day there can be in the Trust account maintained by the Custodian no more than 1,100 ounces of silver in an unallocated form. The bulk of the Trust‚Äôs silver holdings is represented by physical silver, identified on the Custodian‚Äôs or, if applicable, sub-custodian's, books in allocated and unallocated accounts on behalf of the Trust and is held by the Custodian in London, New York and other locations that may be authorized in the future.""

First, let‚Äôs talk about fish. What do they do before they die? They jump around; they try to escape; they make noises. If your hands are weak, you let the fish escape. Now you cannot feed your family because your hands are just made of paper.

I know you are scared, me too. Especially when we thought we lost our guidance today after trading hours and we saw the price dropped without an ability to do anything. For me, I‚Äôve just bought some more at $350 for 16k and I was scared shitless. I‚Äôm not gonna lie.

But, you should know that THEY ARE SCARED too, even more than us. You see, Melvin is nothing but just a big fish to us. This fucking shark I gotta bring it down not only to feed my family but also yours. But before we defeat them, they will use every dirty trick to fuck us over to win back this game. You will get hurt if your hands are not made of diamond. So HOLD IT tight, like you hold your wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs dong.

# WHEN TO SELL?

When you see the price goes up 5 times, 10 times, 50 times, or even more from one day to a week. That is when the short-queeze happens. That is when you sell. If your hands are made of paper, sell your position when it‚Äôs 5x. If your hands are made of wood, sell it at 10x. And so on so forth.

DO NOT SELL IT WHEN THE SQUEEZE DOESN‚ÄôT HAPPEN YET. I repeat, **DO NOT SELL IT WHEN THE SQUEEZE DOESN‚ÄôT HAPPEN YET**. This is a phenomenon that happens only ONCE in your life. You don‚Äôt want to miss it.

TL;DR: Only sell when you see the price spikes up 5x, 10x, 100x from one day to a week. This is the way.

I speak for myself here and no one else (and no one else here speaks for everyone else either).  Feel free to DM for more facts and context.

CNBC, whether its true or not, the past 3 days have made EVERYONE honestly believe that you are truly bought out by Wall Street, in every sense. You‚Äôve paraded ‚Äúanalyst‚Äù after analyst, hedge fund manager after manager, boomer after boomer, to try and demonize and deflect blame for the GameStop situation.

**Firstly, your contributors need to stop pretending they don‚Äôt know short squeeze mechanics.**

You‚Äôve had dozens of people on your air whining about how no one in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) cares about fUnDaMeNtALs and VaLuATiOn regarding GameStop. OF COURSE, we don‚Äôt care about GME‚Äôs fundamentals *anymore*, because we are in a SQUEEZE. We are in a squeeze in which the Shorts have DOUBLED-DOWN constantly. That means OF COURSE the price keeps going into the stratosphere. Do you actually believe your own lie that the Shorts like Melvin have closed out? I don‚Äôt, and we have data that agrees. Why would we sell our shares ‚Äú‚Äôfair value‚Äù‚Äù if the squeeze isn‚Äôt done?

Secondly, most of us are well aware that GME isn‚Äôt a $100billion company, or whatever $5000/share is. I think we are all very much aware that we are in the middle of a short squeeze, NOT price discovery.

*This does not mean that our interest in GME was not a* ***value-based thesis*** *at first*.

Our most famous GME long u/ DeepF\*\*kingValue has been in GME since 2019.([!!!](https://t.co/TengJuA7O9?amp=1)). There are others here who I‚Äôm sure joined at some point way back when. If you want more credibility, the famous Michael Burry and some dudebro Donald Foss both entered large positions in GME a long time ago. These people believed in the **FUTURE** ***VALUE*** of GME. They saw that savage, unrelenting short sellers like Melvin had *pounded* the share price into the ground, actively and immorally aiming for bankruptcy. Retail bought in in September because Ryan Cohen saw enough **value** to buy stock. The price jumped to $13/share in November because Ryan Cohen expressed his vision for a turnaround that people saw a ton of future **value** in. The big spike happened when Cohen n co. joined the BOARD OF DIRECTORS at GME. Why are your hosts and ‚Äúanalysts‚Äù pretending that these things didn‚Äôt happen?

And the whole while, Melvin and Shorts were DOUBLING DOWN on their positions, which were already part of the preposterous, irresponsible and potentially illegal +100% short interest. And even now (as far as we know), the short interest IS STILL **OVER 100%**. STOP PRETENDING THAT THESE THINGS DID NOT HAPPEN. You‚Äôve had people constantly claiming that the prices are reaching these levels ‚Äúfor no reason‚Äù and that the initial bullish sentiment was created ‚Äúout of thin air‚Äù. The people who keep saying these things, including your hosts, are either willfully ignorant or acting in bad faith.

Good, decent people provided their Due Diligence on this subreddit. They pointed out the $6.4billion in revenue in 2019. They pointed out the E-commerce sales *tripling* YOY. They pointed out the ability to easily pay off debt. They even called HUNDREDS of GameStops, where we found out they were constantly selling out of inventory, AND have plans of having PC-building-stations in-store. They pointed out the rapidly expanding Gaming Market, and the ability to grab substantial market share. And yes, they pointed out the 140% short interest, **BUT PEOPLE DID NOT START BUYING $GME SOLELY BECAUSE OF SHORT INTEREST**. Smart or not, honest people here bought into GME initially as a **value** play. They did their homework. They found data. They showed proof of positions. This brings me to my third point:

In the entire time I have been on wallstreetbets, we have NEVER ‚Äútargeted‚Äù a stock or hedge fund JUST to bust the shorts. Short-busting is not who WSB is. Those are the kids on TikTok, or the grifters on Twitter. Every single *popular* thesis on here has been backed up with [research](https://t.co/1ab5ppItOo?amp=1), [financial analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqk15o/fallen_angels_shitty_cars_worse_debt_and_what_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and quality (depending on who you ask) discussion. Just because we talk like, stupid people, doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt say smart things. And maybe our ideas DO end up backfiring (see: [$PRPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jcbj0n/final_score_on_prplw_32m_gain/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3])), and MAYBE 85% of the members don‚Äôt know what theta decay is, but we do *not* pull stocks out of thin air, as you‚Äôve claimed.

People here genuinely believe in these stocks. People here believe in Ryan Cohen, and the potential for GameStop to be reinvented. People believe in Blackberry‚Äôs future (present) as a rock solid software company. This brings me to my final issue:

It is disingenuous and plainly incorrect to blame every. single. price increase. on the ‚Äúreddit rebellion‚Äù and short squeezes. STOP saying we are going after $BBBY ‚Äì there hasn‚Äôt been a substantive post in 4 months on that. STOP saying we are pumping $NOK ‚Äì we‚Äôve advocated for leap calls in NOK for MONTHS because *we know* we cannot wait out their giant share float. And for JPow‚Äôs sake, ***STOP BLAMING US FOR A***\[movie company\]***MC, EX***\[clothing store\]***PR, AND IRBT. TWO OF THOSE TICKERS ARE LITERALLY BANNED FROM THIS SUBREDDIT, AND THE OTHER ISN‚ÄôT EVEN REAL TO US. WE CANT EVEN TYPE THEM INTO A POST WITHOUT GETTING AUTO-DELETED.***  People who try to pump a stock for no reason are BANNED.  Yes, because of the events of this month, and because of the actions of groups like Citron, many people are happily engaging in one particular short squeeze. But that‚Äôs it. Yes, retail is more powerful than you may know, but we are not *that* powerful.

If you or anyone else reading this are wondering why there seems to be more internet chatter on that *one* particular movie company, hear this: *SOMEONE* has been creating fake accounts and BOTS to spam and pump up \[movie company\] and $nok, etc. to distract from GME. Ask the admins. Look at Chamath‚Äôs twitter replies. Look at **ALL** OF FINANCE TWITTER. There are newly created accounts and bots spamming the hell out of these other stocks in an effort to *manipulate* the market and save the shorts. Jeez, I wonder who is behind that? **Could it be the same group of people who bought $1.2million of GME puts right before** [**tweeting something?**](https://t.co/Fz1aTbMa2p?amp=1)

If anyone in the void is reading this, thanks. The point of this post was just to fight back in a tiny way against the days and days of whining millionaires on TV berating people they literally know nothing about. It‚Äôs to point out the ignorance of self-serving boomers saying things like ‚Äúthe SEC needs to regulate  *the* Reddit‚Äù, etc. The point of this post was just to get our little corner of truth out there in the world, because we all know that truth is in short supply. üöÄ

I am your local commie cuckmaster the Gay Bear! And I have important bullshit for you to hate me for.

But first things first. Good job with GME! Those bastards at Melvin and Citron don't deserve the title of Gay Bear. They spew lies and spread propaganda in order to decimate companies, and now it looks like GameStop is on the way to completely revolutionize their business model all thanks to you!

Now back to my commie bullshit.

While you autists have been hyperfixated on GME, the rest of the market decided to take a dump. SPY broke a bound it's been holding on to since last November. Also, the Pring's Special K indicator is closely approaching a lower bound. If you don't trust this indicator, I can assure you that I have done lots of Special K (the hose tranquilizing kind) when a flying midget told me that I can trust it. 

Now that you know it's real, it's time to wildly speculate on why the market would react like this. First of all, if anyone hates commies  more than you, it's hedge fund managers and market movers. They think that communism is when the government takes away their money and gives it to ingrates like you. What a bunch of idiots. 

Now that they think you're basically worse than china, they would rather bring down the whole system out of spite than to acknowledge that you've won.

Also, remember that the orange haired troll printed off money wherever his micropenis pointed to, and now the senile hair sniffer is worried about something called a ""deficit"" whatever the fuck that is. 

So with that, if SPY doesn't recover tomorrow I'm going to drop whatever I've been holding on to and go balls deep on GME, BB, and AMC calls.

Thank you Matt Phillips and Taylor Lorenz for enacting the same level of distain for us as the hedge fundies our tax dollars bailed out after the Great Recession. 

You mischaracterized both the type of people involved in this action (literate, engaged, working poor to middle-class) and the action itself (is it greedy to spend our paychecks wringing dry hedge funds who daily manipulate the markets in milliseconds while we are forced to drop a few bucks here and there and hope for the best?).

There is a palpable elitism at play here, and a deeper concern that rests not with those risking real money during a pandemic for the shot at a better life but for the goddamn MMs and collective arbiters of financial advice and financial institutions beneath whose thumbs we've been placed to squirm long enough. This is a handful of stocks we're using to kneecap some idiot short sellers and you're insinuating that we're about to collapse the whole system. 

We're not. We can't. These motherfuckers can, and have. We're fighting for a piece of the damn pie.

Make up whatever story gets you the headline, ""[above the fold](https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1354635872180662273),"" as you so deliciously revel in bragging about. I hope you both learn from this.

&#x200B;

I was in my early teens during the '08 crisis. I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.

Those close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.

To Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.

To CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/). They include, but are not limited to, **IBM**, **Cisco**, **TMobile**, **JPMorgan**, **Oracle**, and **ZipRecruiter**. Their parent company is [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal), owned by **Comcast** and **GE**.

To the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these ""millennial blog posts"": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? *We're not enemies, we're on the same side*. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.

To WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.

**Okay Autists. I know this is long, with a lot of numbers and concepts, but bear with me. This is good stuff.**

When I was watching the trading today on GME, I noticed something strange regarding the price action and the volume. If you noticed overall today, GME traded around 94 Million shares total. Yesterday total shares were 178 Million. Day before that 177 Million. Day before that, 197 Million. The day before that, 93 Million. Ever since we started ripping up in price, the volume has been around 200 million shares per day. But today, when the price was so high, and with so much volatility (change in price), the total volume was only 94 Million!!! If you look at the one minute chart, by the end of the day average volume per minute was 98 K / minute. And during these crazy downward dips throughout the day, the volume was sometimes as low as 8K. 8k out of 50 million float = 0.016%. That means 0.016% of the total shares changed the price so much!! This doesn‚Äôt make sense. Yesterday‚Äôs average volume/ minute was 500K per minute. Which makes sense for the crazy price movement we had yesterday.

**I think the reason why we had crazy lows and highs today was because of short selling.**

Short selling from day traders who want to make quick profits in the day and get out by the end. Once we hit $385/ share (premarket high ‚Äì day trading short sellers like to use premarket high as a good short starting point because they know a lot of long day traders and paperhanded autists will sell at that point), the short selling day traders came in and started shorting hard to make their quick profits. That‚Äôs why you see the borrowed shares on iborrowdesk.com low around these times. And you have been seeing it fluctuate throughout the last few days. So I think these day trading short sellers were pushing the stock down the whole time, and when the end of the day approached, they covered their position, and we went back up to 344 close, and 373 (close to premarket high where we dropped during the day) during the first minute of after hours.

**Why is this good?**

Because that shows us these massive dips in the day are not because large amounts of autists and every day people are selling, but because the day trader shorts are synthetically pushing the price down. That means we‚Äôve been diamond handing. And even better, the normies are all diamond handing too. Guys, this is on the verge of the squeeze! Don‚Äôt sell and let this shit ride. I believe if we can push past 385 tomorrow, this shit will rip, as no short selling day trader will want to risk getting squeezed. And the crazy enough ones that do will trigger moderate length shorters to cover. Which will have the stock break out higher. Causing the breakout and momentum traders to come join us for the fight. Shit‚Äôs gonna rip. One hedge fund gets liquidated‚Ä¶ more covering‚Ä¶ another hedge fund. 

**Domino effect guys. Game over.**

Some of you may argue that TDameritrade and other brokers prevented trading GME, so that‚Äôs why the volume was low. But check this out, AMC was on that TDameritrade block list too! And they traded 1.19 Billion shares today. That‚Äôs billion with a B. With the average share per minute 2 million/ minute. And we only traded 197 Million. This is not normal. Not normal for a stock that‚Äôs breaking headlines.

There are legitimately WSB millionaires made off this one play. This is history, and I'm glad to have witnessed it.

But I'm seeing a worrying trend here. People are beginning to make this into a moral crusade against ""the man"". Taking down the hedge funds because of their over-greed is no longer a way to make crazy money, it's a moral imperative. Giving advice to hold GME forever, just to punish them.

WSB is not the only thing driving GME up. WSB first noticed it and so we got in early, but other players are also involved. We cannot squeeze Melvin to infinity. Eventually, the position will be closed.

I don't know where the top of GME is. It might be $500. It might be $1000. It might be $10,000. But eventually, the stock will revert to its fundamental value. It happens with every short squeeze every time. And someone is going to be caught holding the bag.

If you are one of those ""I'm holding forever"" people, that person losing all their money is going to be you. The stock is going to crash from $100,000 or wherever it ends up, and when you finally decide to sell Robinhood is going to freeze for 15 minutes and it will congratulate you on your $6 sell. Meanwhile the institutional investor with their real broker made a killing. 

Now I can't wait for the loss porn that is coming to this sub in a month any more than the rest of you. That's what this sub is about. But when that happens, remember, it wasn't ""the man"" who made you lose all your money. You were the one who decided to hold at GME $1,000,000 to fuck Melvin.

BOYS AND GIRLS LISTEN UP, TODAY IS A BIG DAY

Infinity War has gone global. Our retarded brothers and sisters from across the world are getting news about the war and filling our ranks

Quick update: 

*ALLIES* 

**Dr. Michael McFlurry Burry:** Actually autistic. DO NOT TOUCH HIS EARS 

**Supreme Leader General Cohen:** Loves peanuts, dogs, and hamsters. A human golden retriever. The people‚Äôs General. 

**Sir Chamath Brown Knight Palihapitiya:** Good with numbers. Math is literally in his name. Our voice. Hates parasitic billionaire hedge funds. Enjoys passively swinging his giant balls on Twitter. Our Brown Knight. 

**u/deepfuckingvalue:** Likely to become the worlds first trillionaire after Infinity War. Enjoys Seinfeld. Possibly a virgin. The original retard. 

**Lord Chen of BB:** Nimble. Very hard to understand... on purpose. Told securities commission he had no idea why his stock was going up, later that day releases PR of Baidu partnership. ‚ÄúOH so Sorry SEC, me no speakaaaaaa any Engrish‚Äù 

**Papa Musk:** Wields the sword of a thousand truths. Legendary short destroyer and bear meat connoisseur. Lucky numbers are 420 and 69. Actually has rockets. Our Papa. 

**r/wsb:** Actual retards. 

*AXIS OF EVIL:*

**Melvin Capital:** If Voldemort ran the Chum Bucket, you‚Äôd get Melvin Capital. A parasitic leech. Would sell their own mothers for a dime. Pure scum. 

**Andrew Left:** A tremendously gay bear. Wild, and unpredictable. Strong initial attacker, but very low HP. Folds like a house of cards once you make yourself bigger and yell loud noises

**CNBC Boomers:** The mouthpiece of the Axis of Evil. A dying platform. Extremely jealous of our tendies. It was once said: thou shalt not covet thy neighbors wife‚Äôs boyfriend, CNBC did not listen. They want everything from us‚Äîmainly our voice and presence. 

**Retail Bears:** Backstabbing unconscionable fucks. No morals, no backbone. Fucking Judas. 

**Unknown financiers:** The roots are deep in this conglomerate of evil. Final bosses might show up in the coming battles. 

**SEC:** Did not go after anyone for 2008 when the entire world almost collapsed. Now thinks GME stock price too high in their opinion. 

*BYSTANDERS:*

**Jim Cramer:** A real life Ephialtes. Looks like him too. Genuinely wants to be a Spartan, but in the end will sell our stops to Melvin Capital so they can attack our position from the rear. 

Pro tip: NO STOP LOSSES ON A VOLATILE SHORT SQUEEZE

**Retards on the sidelines:** We are witnessing one of the greatest reverse wealth transfers in history. Get in and be a part of history. 

*CASUALTIES:*

**Toilet Paper Handed Soldiers:** WHEN YOU BOUGHT GME AT $150 and it went to $80 WE TOLD YOU WE‚ÄôD COME BACK FOR YOU. No retard left behind. Band of retards. Apes stronger together. I know you are wounded, but the war is not over. 

*FRONTS:*

$GME is the main battle front. There are others. But GME is THE BATTLE FRONT. 

Listen retards, we have literal whales on our side. General Cohen, Papa Musk, Sir Chamath, Dr. Michael McFlurry Burry. We have politicians on our side, AOC, Elizabeth Warren. Possibly the fucking president of the U S and A.

# Wed 01-27

Fantastic trading day. 


Up 97% on the day to close out at $345 battling all through the $300s all day.


Curiously small amounts of volume all day leads me to believe this was small
amounts of short covering and paper hands selling on each bump (we'll know more
when Ortex posts data in the morning).


Yes it took a bit of a dip in the after market, but I expect greatness from our German
brothers and sisters to keep the momentum up today. The plan is the same: buy and hold. 

# *It is working*.

What's most interesting rn is the new $ amount of calls about to expire.


I had to compile a spreadsheet for this from multiple sources because my usual
source didn't have the complete data (highly sus? Are they trying to hide this
data?)

Spreadsheet:

https://imgur.com/a/zXTeR4t

This is essentially just the options chain you can look up. But, if you take
the Open Interest (how many contracts are alive), multiply that by the latest
close price * 100 and then sum all the contracts you get the total amount of $ of shares that are about to be
exercised. 

What's crazy about GME right now?

# EVERY CLIT LICKING CALL IS ITM

That is *insane*. Never seen it before.


Tuesday ended with all those options worth $800mill 


Wednesday? They jumped to $3.5 *billion* and it will continue to rise as share prices rises. Buy and hold.


Two things are gonna happen b/c of this:


-1. Mega Gamma Squeeze. MM's who weren't properly hedged before are about to be (they will have to buy shares on the market
in order to cover these calls expiring higher than their delta position). But remember, all you degens are buying and holding, so there's low af volume and prices skyrocket with every share we *force* them to buy. Read this:
https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/26/gamestops-gargantuan-gamma-squeeze/


tl;dr


> If the stock continues to rise, the market maker's delta position also
> becomes increasingly negative at a faster rate due to gamma, requiring more
> buying, which pushes the stock even higher still, and so forth. This
> phenomenon is known as a gamma squeeze and the feedback loop resembles a
> regular short squeeze.

*feedback loop* you say? 

# Sounds like tendie rocket to me if everyone holds.

-2. Many of these shares can be exercised into proper diamond hands instead of in MM's accounts that will 
loan them back out to shorts. Further squozing the squeezees. This, however requires the owner to put up another position to
exercise.


Moral of the story:


If GME holds or even goes up further Thur & Fri this gamma squeeze could very
likely be the catalyst for the big squeeze come next week.


And it will be *epic*.

Added new summary (30 Jan), and Q&A.

FIRST OFF: This post is not financial advice or anything except the rant of some idiot retard who is an idiot. I tell you straight up that there is a normal investment side to the NOK play (STILL MEANS RISK, which YOU will have to decide!) and that there is a CRAZY side that is PROBABLY IMPOSSIBLE. If you want to play the crazy play then you‚Äôre also a crazy retard idiot just like me.

I don‚Äôt know shit, I just look at graphs and go WOW. Do your own due diligence, I am not a financial advisor. Don‚Äôt ask me if you should buy, I don‚Äôt know, can you afford to? Are you comfortable with the risks? I don‚Äôt know these things. You do.

**NOK PLAY:**

Here‚Äôs how it works. YOU DECIDE if you want to take part.

1.It‚Äôs **not a short squeeze like GME**. Get that out of your head.

2.It‚Äôs a **value/momentum** play. The value part is just normal granny&grampa investing. See a good company going cheap, buy and hold. Tell your mom, dad, granny and grampa, cousins, relatives, friends.

3.The **momentum part is the crazy part**, and if it works the share will SKYROCKET as long as YOU DON‚ÄôT SELL. GME is the biggest short squeeze in history, the NOK play could be the biggest value buy in history.

4. The beauty of it is that **it works because Wall St is dumping NOK irrationally**. That‚Äôs why the price is going down (slowly). They think they‚Äôre attacking us and slowly winning, but they‚Äôre giving us a value share cheap = their money, our pockets. By the time they realize what we did, it will be too late.

5. **Don‚Äôt panic, and keep buying the dumps (if you think the company has value)**, and if we hold the line **you could see a miracle.**

3310 HANDS

&#x200B;

**Value Part (crazy part in Q&A):**

The company is healthy, has good financials, it‚Äôs a market leader in 5G (it‚Äôs main competitors are Huawei and Ericsson, they have about the same market share share of 5G) a lot of potential to be the company that builds 5G for a large part of the world. NOK is currently trading at a standard price for the value it holds. It is not a bubble.

Here‚Äôs Nokia‚Äôs 5G contracts: [https://www.nokia.com/networks/5g/5g-contracts/](https://www.nokia.com/networks/5g/5g-contracts/)

Here‚Äôs Bloomberg shitting bricks that we‚Äôve realized that Nokia is a value bet: [https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-28/gamestop-may-be-a-reddit-wallstreetbets-game-but-nokia-sure-isn-t](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-28/gamestop-may-be-a-reddit-wallstreetbets-game-but-nokia-sure-isn-t)

Nokia also just unveiled new 1tb tech, the thing AFTER 5G. First on the world. They have it, they‚Äôre showing the world it works. Here is their press release from Wednesday: [https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nokia-and-elisa-push-network-boundaries-with-worlds-first-1t-deployment-2021-01-27](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nokia-and-elisa-push-network-boundaries-with-worlds-first-1t-deployment-2021-01-27)

They are so trusted that NASA got them to build a cell network on the MOON. Literally. If you‚Äôre NASA, would you hire your retard uncle Earl to build cell towers on the moon? No, you hire someone who CAN ACTUALLY DO IT. Imagine what it takes to build something really big and complicated on the moon? Now imagine who‚Äôs the likely guy who can do it. That‚Äôs right, NOKIA. Here they are, going to the moon: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/)

If the Huawei 5G war continues, who do you think US and Europe is going to back, especially since NOK already has the next tech, owns a bunch of patents, is from FINLAND that has never tried to take over the world and has a brand that EVERYONE who lived in 2000s remembers?

Here‚Äôs a guy who‚Äôs been doing the numbers for a while now in case you want to see them: [https://www.reddit.com/user/Jimming/comments/l7f6ua/part\_iv\_option\_chain\_analysis\_on\_nok\_and\_why\_you/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jimming/comments/l7f6ua/part_iv_option_chain_analysis_on_nok_and_why_you/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I don‚Äôt know him, I don‚Äôt know the numbers as well, but looks pretty good to me. Amazing due diligence. But what do I know, I‚Äôm an idiot. So is he. So are you. We‚Äôre all fucking retards, just ask Wall Street. I poked myself in the same eye twice yesterday. We‚Äôre ‚Äúdumb money‚Äù. They have other names for us too.

So, worst case, you just bought into a good company at a fair value. If the crazy play doesn‚Äôt work, you just hold on to them and let them become the world leader in 5G. Unlike GME (NOT SAYING SELL!), NOK will not fall 99%. Or if it does, I'M BUYING THAT SHIT because if a HEALTHY COMPANY FALLS 99% you make some CRAZY MONEY on that when it bounces back.

**Q&A**

**Q: You retards were tricked by bots to buying NOK, there‚Äôs no short**

A: This just full on doesn‚Äôt get what the play is about. IT IS NOT A SHORT SQUEEZE. THIS IS NOT GME RINSE REPEAT. GME IS A DIFFERENT PLAY. NOK IS A VALUE PLAY. How many more ways can I say it? Not sure. How many more do I have to?

**Q: Stop taking attention away from GME you retards**

A: Nobody is saying sell your GME. Nobody is saying that. GME is too expensive for a lot of people, and GME is VERY RISKY and NOK has genuine value behind it. If the NOK play works, those people who couldn‚Äôt afford GME can still get on & get rich. If it doesn‚Äôt, they most likely still make money on a good company.

**Q: This play is impossible / crazy / it‚Äôll never work / there are too many shares you retards**

A: This is ALMOST true. This play WAS impossible until 1/27/2021. That is why nobody has EVER tried anything like this. But it‚Äôs NOT impossible anymore. Look at this graph. Look at it. See that spike? What the fuck is that? I‚Äôll tell you my fellow autistic space boot packin 3310 using NOKSTER.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v473xl00ghe61.png?width=2182&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf5aac455156dbadb919b80afacb5232af0a05b5

That spike was them running out of shares for half an hour. Trade was stopped until they could find more, to avoid an artificial spike in the price.

Proof? Look at the volumes. A small sale (red) causes a small dip. Two small buys cause a MASSIVE SPIKE. They ran out, and had to call their friends to liquidate more shares so the price wouldn‚Äôt skyrocket ""artificially"".

But that‚Äôs IMPOSSIBLE for NOK. NOK has 5bn shares. Nokia should be much more stable because it has so many shares, having a crazy demand spike is crazy. I saw it, and fell off my chair and since I‚Äôm such a retard it took me an hour to get back up.

So it **was** impossible, and that‚Äôs why Wall Street won‚Äôt see it coming. They think this is their attack and they‚Äôre about to break through our ranks, but they‚Äôre actually playing right into our hands.

Wendnesday, we moved 1bn shares. Thursday, when nobody could buy, we still moved 500m. Yesterday, we still moved 360m. We‚Äôve moved so much NOK in the past three days, the average volume of the share has MORE THAN DOUBLED in THREE DAYS. The play is not impossible anymore, but Wall St thinks it is, which is how we can use their own strength and mass against them. But the value buy still makes sense WHENEVER you see someone dump a valuable share. Someone sells you a 100$ bill for 90$? Buy it.

They attack? We absorb. They dump, we buy, they run out of shares, we hold. They‚Äôre fucked, and they just handed us a bunch of value shares at an undervalue = they just gave us their money. They are just giving it to you. When they realize they can‚Äôt buy them back at a lower value, what do you think is going to happen?

**Q: We don‚Äôt do value plays, we do short squeezes you retards**

A: Go back to April. Look at u/DeepFuckingValue‚Äôs position. **GME was a value play**. It‚Äôs only in April that the Short Squeeze became possible. Look it up yourself.

Will a short squeeze also happen with NOK? It‚Äôs unlikely. Hedge Fund Assholes have been increasing their shorts in NOK in the last few days, but they won‚Äôt go over 100% on 5bn shares because they're not as stupid as me. But it doesn‚Äôt have to happen. We just need to buy the dumps. If they short, great. More money for us as long as we don‚Äôt let them drive the price down with the dumps.

**Q: Why is NOK not rocketing?**

A: Because Wall Street is dumping, just like I said they would after the Wednesday spike. That‚Äôs the whole plan. They dump, we hold the line, buy the dumps and keep the price steady.

The GME short squeeze guys waited for this for UP TO TWO YEARS. I saw it in April. I thought it was crazy. I didn‚Äôt jump in back then. If I did, I‚Äôd have about as much money as u/DeepFuckingValue. On a value share, you can afford to wait. GME was originally a value play. That‚Äôs what I should have realized in April.

SO JUST WAIT AND HOLD (if you believe and idiot like me, which you shouldn't, no need to message me about it). It‚Äôs been two days since this play even became possible.

**Q: How do we know it‚Äôs working?**

A: Look at the volume of shares traded. Nokia has 5bn shares. In the last three days, nearly 2bn have been traded. The price is still up from last week. That‚Äôs how.

This has already been a giant dumping campaign. How come the price hasn‚Äôt floored? What happens if we just buy it all up?

What happens if they run out, and then their shorts blow, the price bumps up, CNBC tells the world we broke another short wall, everyone piles on, Wall Street realizes they just gave us their shares at an undervalue and try to buy back, we don‚Äôt sell, we have all the shares? The Wednesday spike is what happens, except this time there is no stopping it. If they stop trading again and try to dump some more, you just buy up the dump and keep the spike going. Spike stops being a spike and becomes a floor.

&#x200B;

**Q: Where will this max out and when?**

A: What do you think I‚Äôm from the future? I just saw an impossible thing happen on Wednesday, and we need to make it happen again. Look at the graph. Look at it.

Set your targets to $3310, that should do it.

**Q: When should I buy? What should I buy? Should I buy?**

A: Be your own person. Buy when you feel like it, if you feel like it.

**Q: Wall street bots are promoting NOK.**

A: I don‚Äôt give a shit. If they are, and we keep buying, they are promoting giving us money.

Part 2: (29 Jan)

First off, much as I appreciate the love, I can‚Äôt play your hand for you. You have to make your own decisions. Do I know where NOK is going to be tomorrow? Nope. Nobody does. All that I have for you is the news from Wednesday that this play is no longer totally impossible:

1. I think the assholes are going to try to dump you out of the market
2. It won‚Äôt work if we keep the demand up.
3. The way we keep demand up is we buy, and others will follow us because the company is good.
4. When they realize it won‚Äôt work, they‚Äôll need to start buying back in.
5. Then it‚Äôll be too late, cos they dumped their shares on US and we are RETARDS who HOLD. That means that when their shorts start to go bust, the price will jump up (a little bit, not like with GME at first ‚Äì this is a different play based on the health of the company, not a straight up short squeeze. The short position on NOK is much smaller).
6. When the price jumps up, and the GME guys start cashing out, they need somewhere to put that cash. Some of them pay off student loans, or buy cars or whatever, but the smart ones will go NOK.

How you play it is up to you. I can‚Äôt tell you if you should buy, what minute to buy, what app to use and so on. All I can say is I buy the dumps. You need to decide for yourself if you want to do it. You can see the dumps on any app, or even yahoo finance. I buy NOK on NYSE, and I buy straight up shares (so they can‚Äôt lend out mine for shorts) but you‚Äôre free to do what you want. I‚Äôm a retard, you‚Äôre a retard, we‚Äôre all autistic fucks, we make up our own mind and stick with it.

Secondly, what I said yesterday morning would happen, did happen. And it happened exactly like I said it would. So don‚Äôt get scared off, just buy the dumps. And they know that they‚Äôll be fucked if we keep buying the dumps. That‚Äôs why they stopped us from buying NOK.

NOK hasn‚Äôt bubbled, stopping us from buying NOK was because they know we‚Äôre on to them. They know the dumps won‚Äôt work if we JUST KEEP BUYING and HOLDING. The play works, they‚Äôre scared, we caught them with their pants down, they‚Äôre trying to get ahead of us.

OK, so about what happened yesterday with RH and others. I‚Äôm so fucking angry about this.

What RH and others did is completely insane. Their argument is ‚Äúyou guys are throwing your money away on a bubble, we‚Äôre just protecting you‚Äù. Bullshit. I won‚Äôt comment on GME, I‚Äôll let u/DeepFuckingValue or one of those guys do that. I‚Äôll just say, that short squeezes happen with hedge funds all the fucking time. Why is trading not stopped for them? They have people‚Äôs fucking pensions that they‚Äôre playing with.

But for NOK, it‚Äôs TOTAL BULLSHIT. Here‚Äôs why:

1. NOK HAS NOT BUBBLED. Look at the graph. Look at it. It is still down from 2016. NOK is well within normal variation. Long term, you barely see the spike from a couple of days ago. There is nothing to ‚Äúprotect us‚Äù from. They‚Äôre protecting themselves.
2. The NOK play is not a straight up short squeeze. The play is HELPED by the shorts that are there, as long as we can keep the demand up and keep the price up against the dumping, but that‚Äôs all.
3. NOK is a healthy company, with new and important tech, a great brand, a lot of potential. You want to see why, read the original post. ANYONE who sees a company like that being dumped for NO REASON would buy. So should you. They are only dumping it because they‚Äôre trying to fuck up our play.

Ok that‚Äôs enough for now. I‚Äôll see you all when I‚Äôve got my space boots on, in my house on the FUCKING MOON, next to a NOKIA Comms tower, or I‚Äôll see you in VALHALLA with my broke ass. If this doesn‚Äôt work, then at least you TOOK ON THE MOTHERFUCKERS and EARNED A PLACE at the table with FUCKING ODIN.

UNBREAKABLE 3310!

**ORIGINAL POST (28 Jan):**

I get it, it‚Äôs not the play. I‚Äôm not saying sell your GME. I‚Äôm not a bot or a spy or a wall street asshole. I‚Äôm a regular guy who‚Äôs got a couple of bucks in his bank account and plays videogames and wants a fucking house to live in like my parents had when they were young. If you don‚Äôt agree with me, just say so.

I‚Äôm also not a financial advisor, so make up your own minds you autistic fucks.

But, BUT, yesterday we did something they‚Äôve never seen. Yesterday, we made them run out of NOK shares. That‚Äôs what that big spike was, and that‚Äôs why trading was stopped for 2h. If we keep doing that, it will be the biggest wall street wealth transfer from assholes to retards in history. Because they will keep dumping it until it‚Äôs too late.

Impossible, you say. Too many shares, you say. Well listen up. Yesterday, in ONE DAY, we traded, or caused others to trade, 1bn shares of Nokia. That is 1/5 of all the Nokia shares in the world. That‚Äôs never happened, *EVER*. Not even when Nokia was the biggest phone company in the world.

3516.16% of average trading volume.

Do you get it? They‚Äôll keep dumping their stock, we keep buying them cheap, and then they won‚Äôt be so cheap anymore when they try to buy back in. We can move 1bn shares IN A DAY. ONE DAY. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Why do they stop trading in NYSE? Cos they ran out of shares temporarily and they don‚Äôt want ‚Äúartificial‚Äù spikes in the prices. So they made us retards wait a couple of hours while some assholes called some other assholes to unload their shares into the market, and once they had enough, they started again. That‚Äôs why that spike went down right after the freeze.

But then we did it again. And they had to stop again. The price just wouldn‚Äôt go down. The assholes who‚Äôd just unloaded shares were probably back on the phone with the other assholes who‚Äôd convinced them.

Everyone is watching us. What we do, millions of normal folks do with us, and every wallstreet asshole does against us.

What did the asshole brigade do? They started shorting NOK. They will continue to do that, because they think we‚Äôre retards (they are correct).

But how come the price didn‚Äôt go down? It‚Äôs got 5bn shares, and everyone whos ever held it was dumping it. How could we ever keep up the demand when there are so many shares out there? How is this going to work?

Because the retard brigade was buying it. There‚Äôs 3m of us and counting. If we each put 600 bucks on NOK, we get 100 shares, and that‚Äôs 300m shares.

Now imagine what happens if we put 6000 on it. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. And every dip you see, you buy more. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. They'll keep dumping, we keep buying, until they realize the price isn't going down. Then they start buying, we keep holding, the market runs out of NOK. Price skyrockets.

And normies outside were following us. They can see that the stock is still LOW, lower than 2016. This means they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bubble that‚Äôs going to crash on them.

So why do the normies follow us on this, and not on GME? (I‚Äôm not saying sell GME).

Because GME has never, ever been anywhere near where it is now. That scares a normal guy who‚Äôs just trying to put in some savings for his family. They think this is some Dutch tulip market shit.

Not so with NOK. Even with the spike from yesterday, NOK is still *DOWN* from 2016. Remember 2016? Remember that being a really big year for Nokia? No, me neither. And let‚Äôs not even get started on where it has been in the past. Yesterday's spike barely shows on the graph.

You know what is going to be a big year? 2021 and 2022. Why?

What else did NOK say yesterday? Well, they revealed that they have a new kind of 1 terabit data transfer networks shit, what do I know, I‚Äôm not a techie. But it IS a new kind of technology that‚Äôs going to kick 5Gs ass. And my fellow retards of the most honorable retard brigade ‚Äì Do you think we‚Äôre going to need more data this year than last year?

Remember how Netflix had to downgrade its picture quality in March because the networks couldn‚Äôt handle the amount people were streaming? What do you think is going to happen with the company that solves that?

But why would NOK be the company? Well, remember the 5G war with China?

US and Europe can‚Äôt buy 5G from China, because then China has our networks. But guess who US and Europe aren‚Äôt afraid of? Fucking FINLAND. Finland, the land of NOKIA. So tiny that some people think the whole country is a conspiracy theory and doesn‚Äôt really exist. Sorry Finnish people, nobody gives a shit about you. Good thing for you, cos you get to build the 5G network on the moon and shit because nobody is scared that Finland will take over the world.

Want proof? They are literally building one on the FUCKING MOON: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/)

And we‚Äôre going to send them there. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

But hang on, why is NOK so low in the first place if it‚Äôs so great?

Answer: because Microsoft fucked them. That‚Äôs right, they sent one of their own assholes to infiltrate the NOK, leak a bunch shit to drive the share price down, and then buy the phone part of the company. These assholes wrecked the company, the Finnish economy, and every middle class shareholder who was just trying to put their kids to college. Imagine everyone who‚Äôd be fucked if someone did that to Apple now.

Worked like a charm. Firesale. Business restructuring. Lost their phones. NOK never recovered.

The asshole they sent from Microsoft? Went back to work for Microsoft, and was paid a shit ton of money for what he did. His name is Stephen Elop. Look it up.

So they have tech that nobody else has and a brand that everyone recognizes. But what don‚Äôt they have? Money. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre building this 1tb magic network thing in tiny fucking possibly fake Finland to show everyone it works.

But if we drive the share price up, do you think that‚Äôs going to change?

So FUCK IT. I‚Äôm in for every penny, and I am HOLDING. I‚Äôll see you in my house ON the MOON next to a NOKIA Comms tower, or I‚Äôll see you in VALHALLA you BEAUTIFUL RETARDED MOTHERFUCKERS.

TL;DR: NOK is literally going to the moon. Go there with them. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Paper hands should be ashamed to succumbing to the pressure from dementor hedge funds.

I would also like to preface this post with the fact that this is not a war on billionaires, the wealthy yada yada, but it may well be described as a resistance against injustice, inequiality, rigged rules, uneven playing field etc which has been rampant on Wall Street forever.

Billionaires are not baddies, at least not all of them. It's what they decide to do with their wealth that is the problem. Using one's wealth to perpetuate inequality and injustice is not cool. If all hedge funds were dismantled tomorrow, there will be absolutely no negative consequences to society or social fabric. Hedge funds are not the greatest capital allocators. In fact they are shit at it and the last couple of weeks have proven it.

Using wealth to propel humankind to become multiplanetary species, solving climate change, building infrastructure, promoting social capital, improving fairness, leveling the playing field that's super cool!

Sending lots of love to the following billionaires / millionaires: Elon, Chamath, Ryan Cohen, Peter Thiel, Dave Portnoy, Mark Cuban even Warren Buffett and Dr Michael Burry

Fuck you's: Gabe Plotkin (Melvin Capital), Steve Cohen (Point72), Leon Shaulov and Rob Crespi (Maplelane Capital), Ken Griffin (Citadel)

\------------------------------------------------

Now to the main part. What you fellow smooth-brains and soft-heads have discovered is called a 'market inefficiency' and you are correcting it. The market is acting exactly like it's intended to act. **You are not the problem, you are actually the solution.**

***Why fundamentals don't matter?***

Fundamentals stopped mattering the moment $GME's short interest breached 100% of the available float. See, markets should work as a two way function (you should be able to derive x from y and y from x). There is no possibility at all to buy more than 100% of the available float at any point in time, so why would it be possible to short more than 100% of the float? Why would the market allow such an asymmetric property? Well it shouldn't and the market would and is correcting that.

***So what does matter?***

What really matters now is first principles. Yes, exactly like Papa Elon resumes most of his thought processes as far away as possible from foolish abstractions (read 'fundamentals') down to first principles, this is exactly the same thing what the market is doing right now.

The fools at CNBC (fuck you Wapner - hope you are reading this), CNN, Boomerberg have described the price as being irrational, devoid of logic and reason. So let's break this down for them starting from first principles, Economics 101.

Supply and demand form the most crucial concepts of economics. Whether you are an academic, farmer, banker, hedge fund loser, smooth-brain redditor or a CNBC reporter, the basic premise of supply and demand equilibrium is integrated into your daily actions. Only after understanding the basics of this can the more complicated aspects be mastered.

So let's look at the demand and supply of $GME shares

Demand side:

* Bullish investors - it is no secret that a lot of the investors have taken a position after the narrative around $GME's business model and future prospects are significantly more optimistic with Ryan Cohen now in the driving seat. Now that brankruptcy is out of question, it is for each investor to judge and decide what the fair value for the stock is. I will leave this part to each one of you individually, as I am just a degenerate smooth-brain redditor that doesn't know shit.
* MMs (no, not market manipulators, just market makers) - these guys sold a ton of short-dated call options to you and haven't learned a shit from what happened last Friday. They are going exactly the same path this friday. There are now around 300k of OI that are ITM (probably more by end of today), which translates into 30M shares that need to be found to the option holders by EOD tomorrow.
* SS (no, not the nazi troops, just the short sellers) - yeah, you know exactly what's going on here, since this is the essence of the story. Short sellers borrowed around 70M shares and must get them at any price.

Supply side:

* Float - these are the shares that are openly traded and exchange hands every day. Around 51M shares (probably less since you all have diamond hands)
* Share issuance - the company can decide to issue new shares. I believe $GME shelf issuance ammount is around $100M. At yesterday's share price of $347, that's only 0.3M shares. But let's round up to 1M

So what do we get:

Demand = 30M from MMs + 70M from SSs + 10M from bullish investors (this number is out of thin air, I have no clue what it should be). **Total demand: 110M**

Supply = 51M from float + 1M from share issuance. **Total supply: 52M**

Demand / Supply ratio: 2.1x

I will let CNBC, Boomerberg, CNN find another security, commodity, bond or whatever that has that demand / supply ratio and then make a judgement on the price for $GME shares.

Finally, *the invisible hand* is a metaphor introduced by the 18th-century Scottish philosopher and economist Adam Smith, characterizes the unseen forces that move the free market economy. It is that very invisible hand that came back to slap the shit out of the 'masters of the universe' hedge funds that decided to ignore the most basic principles of economics.

If any of the hedge fund dementors read this, note that the free market will always, always humble you and put you back where you belong. Fuck you!

**So, why should you continue to buy and hold GME?**

Big hedge funds bet heaps of money that GME üöÄ would go bankrupt and have been put against a wall. If investors (and retail investors like us retards) hold, this forces the hedge funds to cover AKA buy back stock at whatever price is available AKA a short squeeze.

Time for some learning so take your rockets and listen the fuck up space-cadets: üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Now that I have your full attention - pretty much the butt pirates over at Melvin Capital **fucked up big time**. Melvin along with Citron Research (AKA Andrew ""Smoothbrain"" Left) and a few other companies shorted, expecting it to continue to lose ALL revenue. Now, the problem is, they overshorted GME by about \~140 fucking percent.

Essentially as long as investors can üíé HOLD üíé past the initial burst of buy-backs (which ***could*** be as soon as Friday with how many ITM options are sitting on Melvin's books). If you don't understand 'Days to Cover' I suggest doing some ACTUAL FUCKING RESEARCH but in short:

*""****Days to cover****, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.* ***Days to cover*** *is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question.""*

**Short Interest (Shares Short):** 61 - 71.2M

**Short Interest Ratio (Days To Cover):** 2.1 - 6.3

*^(\*there is some disparity here between data sources - approx. as reported 28th Jan 2021)*

As long as everyone holds their GME stocks, this demand by Melvin and Citron will continue to drive up the price, and this can go on technically till GME hits X number because they can only close their positions once people start selling. Remove your fucking sell limits if you like money.

**No selling > no shorts closing > demand for the stock increases > price goes up even higher.** There is no ceiling to this, the power is in your hands to buy and hold.

The point here is, the covering will take **DAYS** to happen. DAYS. No space cadets left behind so get your fucking helmet ready for launch.

Millions of people suppressed by the 1% are coming out in droves to fight back. To take back a small, but significant piece of what we‚Äôve help build. We‚Äôve lined the pockets of the greedy corporations, who have exploited the working class. In 1965, CEO employee ratio was 21:1, today it is 320:1 and rising.
This move has provided an opportunity for new and veteran retail traders to regain some of that capital back.

This forum‚Äôs open and transparent dialogue has helped people pay off loans, make their rent payments, and perhaps get back on their feet after a horrific and painful 2020. It‚Äôs time the world gets to enjoy some tendies. Today, some kid‚Äôs $2k to $50k trade can help him regain some footing. Perhaps he can buy something supporting a small business or even start his own. 

This forum has transformed the economic narrative. Short traders pushing to bankrupt businesses at 138% of a company‚Äôs value will forever need to reconsider their moves. America was built on the backs of hard working people. Many of these people still work at some of these companies earning minimal pay. Shorts like this puts more people out of work and further into debt further suppressing their ability to make a sustainable living. Billion dollar hedge funds will need think twice about trying to bulldoze America simply for the benefit of a few.

Many of us grew up with some of these companies. Companies like GameStop and AMC are part of
Americana. Sure, you may not have liked the $3 trade in for your game or perhaps you always wondered if the popcorn attendant came in your bucket, but fuck did you not still enjoy the movie experience. Other‚Äôs like Nokia and BB helped transform the way we communicate, share and communicate today. Way before we would browse Reddit while shitting, we were playing snake on our 6160. BB was, and still is Canadian. We hated their phones, but love our neighbors. These companies, who have lived among the most shorted companies, finally tells corporate greed that their game stops. 

So, to my fellow autist, as we rise this morning and gain further momentum, get ready to B.A.N.G. hard. There‚Äôs no time to slow fuck this. Get up, stay hard, and seize fucking the day. Our time has come.

I like the stocks, but LOVE you all."|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093229.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['CEO', 'AMC', 'BB', 'BB', 'B', 'A', 'N', 'G', 'I', 'LOVE']|['AMC']

Here's the deal, retards:

LKNCY is a Chinese coffee company, and it's bigger than Starbucks there. It's cheap, and they use an app-order business model which has been very efficient and innovative. As of Jan. 2020, they managed 4,507 stores in China. Why, then, is their stock priced at only $13?

Fraud. In mid-2020, it came out that they had inflated their 2019 sales numbers. This resulted in the stock price plummeting from $50 to $2, top executives including the CEO being fired, and getting delisted from NASDAQ.

The stock price has slowly climbed back up under the new management, and on Dec. 16, 2020, they settled with the SEC. The stock price spiked that day. It's gone all the way up to $13, in recent days, in anticipation of a JPL report being released on Jan. 29th.

In my opinion, this stock is still extremely undervalued, looking at where it was before the fraud case. They're now starting off with a clean slate, and a ton of locations in the world's second-largest economy. Starbucks is valued about 7.5x more, in terms of stock price. Also, there's been some heavy manipulation seen. I think we can make this shit fly if you all hop in.

My apologies for not having the time to respond to some of the commentary - I will try to do some of that if I can later today. I was happy to see that our prediction that some companies might monetize their short squeeze with a secondary offering indeed came to pass with AMC.  Hopefully, GME will capitalize on this unusual opportunity - but even without any financing activity, the free publicity for GME from this event, along with inevitably increased sales, will likely leave the companies stock higher for the long run, perhaps significantly higher than from where it started.

It makes me happy to see that we were correct in suggesting GME would continue to move up, ""perhaps substantially so"", which indeed it did.  Unfortunately, my fund only had a very small long position in GME, and we have since liquidated this after seeing it over double.

Now what I'm going to say now will probably prove very unpopular on this forum, and it is being said not to offend anyone but simply to state the fact.  GME's current stock price is divorced from reality and will ultimately collapse down, perhaps substantially so from current levels.  Now I'm not saying anyone should short this stock - that's a fool's errand.  Nor should options like long short-term puts be used to bet this will occur.  Option implied volatility for this issue would make it more likely you will loss money on any such bet.  This is because the squeeze here is largely over.  Massive forced buying of GME has occurred from many funds, that were backed up against margin requirements and needed to preserve liquidity and cover.  The overall loss in both the S&P and DJIA yesterday only exacerbated the need for many funds to cover their short positions. Run-ups in many heavily short issues (like GWPH) occurred yesterday as long-short hedge funds were forced to both sell their longs and simultaneously cover their shorts in an attempt to avoid the fate of Melvin capital and the bleak alternatives of either bankruptcy or begging for garage sale dilutive capital infusions in order to avoid a total loss.

This sequence of forced buying has largely already played out, both for GME and for many other similar companies like BB.  Now I have no idea where GME will be today, tomorrow or even a month from now - but ultimately it will fall from today's artificially elevated values. It is impossible to know when this collapse will occur, but this is essentially a certainty.  The point I'm making here is simple: If you have profits in this company, or others that have recently participated in the near marketwise epic short squeeze, you should take them and probably do so quickly.  This is your change to profit from the many long-short hedge funds who have been given a real beat-down from this epic retain investor phenom. Once the collapse in valuations occurs here, it is very unlikely a repeat of the recent action will occur - at least for the recently squeezed companies.  So get out, take your profits and, at least for now, park the profits in a profitable company with a reasonable valuation and future growth prospects - like APPL which, for full disclosure,  we have a very large long position in.  I am very confident you will get higher future returns with that strategy versus the alternative of holding GME for the long term.

I am very happy retail investors (like me just a few years back) have taken it to the street on this one!

This is an extension of my DD series on GME. If you haven‚Äôt read them and have time, they will provide some background on my previous predictions, some of which have already come true. In this post, I‚Äôll share my thoughts on what I think is going on, plus some tips to manage your positions and exits. 

**TL;DR:** Shorts are in but likely want to get out. And they want to get out at the best price possible. See tips for managing positions.

# What‚Äôs happening with the price? 

### We‚Äôre still gamma squeezing

Many media outlets are reporting this as a ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù. They‚Äôre only partially right, as [if Melvin isn‚Äôt lying they‚Äôve already been squeezed out](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-stock-short-sellers-melvin-capital-citron-surrender-bets-gme-2021-1-1030010382). 

However, the reality is so far we‚Äôve been Gamma squeezing - repeatedly - and some shorts have been casualties along the way. 

See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/) for a deeper explanation, but the essence of it is that market-makers have to buy shares to hedge the calls they sell. The more calls people buy, the more shares they MMs have to hedge with. As I explained in [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/), GME has ultra low liquidity, i.e. there‚Äôs **waaaay fewer actively traded shares than what shorts need to buy to cover with**, and then when you get lots of people buying calls and shares in the hot new stock it just **removes more availability** from the market. 

As a result, when MMs buy shares to hedge, it moves the price of the underlying up. Combine that with the buying pressure of people piling into a stock climbing 100% a day, shorts getting liquidated, and it‚Äôs a perfect storm. 

Today, GME closed at $347 (before the after market selloff, but i‚Äôll get to that soon). 

320 calls were added yesterday. Similarly, when 115cs were added we squeezed to >115 in two days. Same story with 60c‚Äôs etc.

Remember this commentary from [EndGame part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l528pz/gme_endgame_part_3_a_new_opponent_enters_the_ring/) on Friday‚Äôs price action:

*Notice how the stock dropped from a high of $75 on Friday to below 60 - the highest expiring SP for the 1/22 options, and* ***stayed tight in range for the rest of the day****. Now, for compliance reasons, MM are required to be neutral by EOD, so 20 minutes before close, MMs had to buy back all their short positions, which led to the strong close above 60.*

*All this led me to believe that the* ***real fair market price for GME was above $65.*** *Without the market makers interference, GME would have closed higher.* 

Now, what happened today? We opened at **$351, more than double the previous close of $145** and after the morning profit taking, we squeezed to a **high of $372** as MMs furiously tried to hedge the 320 calls they sold you the day before for peanuts. 

See, the thing is, [Kenny G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_C._Griffin) doesn‚Äôt like to lose money. The magical method Citadel‚Äôs market makers make money, is that they sell you call giving you the right to buy shares at a certain price, say $320, for the nice price of $10/share (for example). Now, as long as Citadel‚Äôs MMs can buy all the shares they have to give to you for less than $320, that $10 is free money. However, when the underlying moves too fast, the MMs have to buy shares for more than $320, and **Kenny G does not like that.** 

Today was a shock to the MMs that sold all the 320cs yesterday. A ***six-sigma event after a six-sigma event after a six-sigma event***. Yet again, within days (a day?) of offering new, higher strikes - **every call option ever sold was in the money, before they had a chance to adequately hedge.**  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cq5wy45433e61.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c75a1e1a6e3808b54bafc646e2e6a7f29ca7cc3

So, just as on Friday, if the price got too high above **$320**, market makers dug into their bag of tricks to start selling it off. (People taking profits here helped too.) However, multiple times, when GME went **below $300**, MMs took their opportunity to hedge the 1/29 calls. So, just as before, *we traded in a tight range around the highest strike.* 

My conclusion from this action the first time was that **GME‚Äôs fair price was being actively suppressed**, and **it proceeded to 5x** in the next few days. There‚Äôs a possibility we‚Äôre in a replay and will see more upward movement on delta hedging alone.  

The point of this is: I think shorts are feeling the squeeze, for sure, reporting [massive mark-to-market losses**.** ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-short-sellers-squeezed-losses-reddit-traders-army-cohen-palihapitiya-2021-1-1030006226) **But I believe the shorts are still in.**

### Shorts are still in

As of Wednesday morning, Ortex was estimating a **short interest of 65M shares**, down from 71M shares the day before.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ze8wx15633e61.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a034dbb3c54509c6267f20c4122ecdf3f6cf4bc

If you‚Äôve read my Part 1 ([DTC Infinity](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/)), you‚Äôll hopefully recall my thesis that there are actually less than **24M** shares available, and therefore that it would be nigh impossible for shorts to close. Since then a slew of new investors have piled in to **buy and hold** GME, from little guys like us to big-ass-whales like [Blackrock](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000083423721001340/us36467w1099_012621.txt) **increasing their holdings to** **13% of GME.**

So what? I think the available shares for shorts to buy **are down to under 20M, and they have to buy 65M shares to close**. *Shorts have barely begun to cover.* We‚Äôve only been increasing the cost of their exits!

Now, let‚Äôs talk about Melvin Capital. I loved watching Chamath defend retail investors and argue against the institutional leveraged shorting that got us here in the first place, but I also learned something interesting that helped me understand how the 140% short interest had in the first place, and how the unwinding may go. 

At [2:10 Chamath says](https://youtu.be/DYZHtF-tV0k?t=135) ‚Äú*Gabe Plotkin is one of the giants of our era, but at the end of the day, what happens is that his trades are copied by umpteen other hedge funds that follow along* ‚Äù 

This tells me 2 things:

* A lot of hedge funds (likely [Maplelane](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/hedge-fund-maplelane-loses-about-33-on-short-bets-this-month), [D1](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/dan-sundheim-s-20-billion-d1-capital-loses-about-20-this-month), [Viking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_Global_Investors), [Point72](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/business/point72-gamestop.html), and more) followed each other into this short. Much like retards like us get behind good DD shared in the open, these institutional retards got together with their cigars and golf clubs behind closed doors and decided together to go in together against GME. 
* If Melvin is really out, it‚Äôs unlikely the other funds are going to want to stay in, lest they be compared poorly to Melvin if GME continues to go against them. **The other shorts want out.**

Chamath also tells us that prime brokers (the brokers that hedge funds use) are seeing [**‚Äúthe biggest 4-day degrossing from hedge funds they‚Äôve ever seen‚Äù.**](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354646282678149127?s=21)

**Again, the problem is - there just aren‚Äôt enough shares.** Shorts have dug themselves a massive grave by shorting more shares in existence and continuing to short while Cohen grabbed up 9M shares, institutions added to their positions, and retail traders piled in.

For [**boomers like this tard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgYZk9Mc804) that can‚Äôt understand why the price is so high - go back to Econ 101, supply and demand bitch. 

# It‚Äôs costing shorts incredible $ to hold their positions

Here‚Äôs all the ways shorts are losing money.

* They pay borrow fees to loan the stock. At one point today, the GME stock borrow fee [hit 250%](https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1354646088221913089) for new borrows. At $300/share that‚Äôs $2/day. That doesn‚Äôt sound like much right? What if you shorted at $50? 
* The short position on GME has ballooned to **$25BN from a low of $1B.** *The borrow fees are applied to the latest closing price, not the price you shorted at.* 
* Funds are paying **interest fees on the margin they are using for the short**
* And oh yeah, GME‚Äôs up like 800% in 5 days. 

# Dirty tactics continue

At this point, I think ‚ÄúTHEY‚Äù have figured out that gamma squeezes are absolutely destroying hedge funds. So what do they do? 

* **THE BIGGEST DIRTIEST TACTIC OF ALL - they only allow you to sell, not buy. HEY SEC, WHY ARE SHORTS STILL ALLOWED TO SHORT WHEN LONGS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BUY. WHY ARE INSTITUTIONS ALLOWED TO COLLUDE?**
   * **This is insane. Funds, prime brokerages, and market makers all stood to lose money so they disabled trading of GME due to ""volatility"". Citadel invests in Melvin capital. Then brokerages shut down buying!**
* Brokerages down
* Options not loading
* Restrict retail trading on GME
   * **I‚Äôm seeing reports that retail buyers not allowed to hold more than 100 GME options now**
   * &#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/is4qn8n733e61.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=741f80fc182e27584954691ebb581ffee15f86ef

* This is a direct defense against more gamma squeezes and an **attack on retail investors, giving institutions a distinct advantage.** 
* **HEY Shortsellers Enrichment Corporation** \- how is it ok for [Citron to buy thousands of puts minutes before their tweet](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) and how is it ok for prime brokers to give hedge funds 10-100x leverage, but the little guys can‚Äôt have more than 100 options total?  
   * Personally, I don‚Äôt really do 100s of options all at once but now I really want to. Fuck this. 
* More short ladder attacks. Look at after-hours trading on GME - a rapid short ladder attack during low-volume trading in order to bring the price down. 
* **If you use stop losses on GME and leave them on, you will get stop-loss hunted.** 

&#x200B;

Ripple effects of the squeeze

* These hedge funds that are short GME, are also short other equities like BBBY, AMC, etc. 
* These hedge funds are also long other shares with leverage, so the ONLY way they‚Äôre staying alive and not covering their shorts, is that they‚Äôre **reducing their long leverage. This means selloffs in the broader market** as they have to shore up their margin requirements against the massive short squeezes in their portfolios.

# I believe we‚Äôre at a tipping point

* I don‚Äôt believe shorts have really covered yet. They have defended by getting capital infusions and reducing their long leverage. I.e. they have begun liquidating long positions. 
* If GME climbs more, they will be **forced to cover and liquidate.** 

# Things to be careful about

As you can see, this is no easy win. In addition to the [suggestions I wrote about in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/), here‚Äôs some things to be careful about. 

* **There are threats to halt trading. Shares are safe, they do not expire. Calls can be destroyed by tactics like buying halts.** 
* **Be careful about swapping ITM calls for OTM calls:** it can be tempting to trade-up your options for higher return, but be mindful of the delta impact. You may actually be driving the sale of shares by MMs when you don‚Äôt mean to. For example, if you sell a .5 delta call for 2 .2 delta calls, that‚Äôs net reduction of 10 shares that MMs have to hold long as leverage. 
* **Be careful about being short any calls this week:** Not only do you limit your upside (which is dumb in the prospect of a squeeze), you could end up in a nightmare scenario. A call that ends OTM on Friday could end up ITM after hours if you didn‚Äôt sell it, and you may get assigned while the underlying continues to go up. **Close spreads if your short legs are deep ITM** unless you want to risk early assignment and high hard-to-borrow fees. 
* **There are a few other dirty tactics shorts can play.** I‚Äôm not specifically going to share them here because I don‚Äôt want to give the ideas circulation, but 
   * **Choose your own limit sells based on personal sell points.** Don‚Äôt copy others and don‚Äôt try to be memey. Make your own decisions. 
   * **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it‚Äôs an **attack vector** for you. 
* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn‚Äôt resume for the rest of the day? **All your 1/29 calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you‚Äôre taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration. 
* **Be careful about buying on margin.** Brokers are rapidly increasing margins. If you bought on margin with 2:1 leverage, and the stock went up 100%, you‚Äôd be in margin call even without a margin change. If the broker moves margin against you, you‚Äôll get to margin call faster. 
* **Don‚Äôt bet more than you can afford to lose.** I‚Äôve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing (remember last Monday with the short sale restriction?), you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I‚Äôve held through multiple 30-40% drawdowns in the underlying; and **held through a 50% drawdown today**, so you need to be ready for the volatility. 
* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It‚Äôs common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you‚Äôve set a stop loss, be really sure about it. 
* **Don‚Äôt sell on dips.** You‚Äôre only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when it‚Äôs heading up. Sell high, not low retards.
* **Save dry powder to buy on dips.** Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities. Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points. GME has incredible daily volatility. Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill. Have patience when buying.

This is not financial advice; do your own DD. I‚Äôm holding over $1M in shares and calls.  **I AM NOT SELLING WHEN THE BUYING MARKET HAS BEEN REMOVED. YOU ARE BOUND TO NOT GET A FAIR MARKET PRICE.**

**Update** New ortex data shows 51M short interest. So the covering has begun.

**Update 2:** what you are seeing in the price drops is likely the gamma squeeze in reverse. People are rightly selling their short term calls, so MMs are selling shares they bought to hedge. That drives the price down, which then causes more de-hedging. This is all a manufactured selloff by elimination of ability of people to buy the equity and should absolutely be investigated. It's very likely the big boys knew the buying restriction was coming and started the selloff last night.

**Update 3:** getting angrier by the minute. Reviewing the volume and price action and shorts bought in volume at the absolute bottom.

&#x200B;

We all just got screwed by Robinhood's screwup here. I'm friends with a lawyer who says we have a good case for a class action lawsuit.

&#x200B;

Everyone comment here if you have/had shares or calls in GME held in Robinhood at market open today.

&#x200B;

Let's show these guys the system can't fuck with us!

&#x200B;

Edit:

Everyone take screenshots of Robinhood's app saying you can't buy, or blocking your orders.

Edit the 2nd:

Wheeeew lads let's get on it! I'll go through all these pms and comments this afternoon with my lawyer friend. Keep em coming!

And please share!

Edit 3:

OMFG guys I'm getting 1000s of PMs! It'll take a while to sort through them all and reply, but keep messaging and sharing! Also if you were using WeBull or some other brokerage and got blocked, you might as well join too.

Edit 4:

My team and the lawyers had a conference call, and it's on!

We'll have an update in the next 48 hours with the procedures and next steps.

If you have any questions or concerns, please PM me and I'll try to get through as many as I can once we have more details.

Edit 1/30:

Work is ongoing. Sorry for the lack of news, the lawyers are still getting their ducks in a row. I'll update with more info as soon as it's available."|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093209.csv|StockTicker|['WE', 'WSUIT']|[]|['GME', 'OMFG', 'PM', 'I']|['GME']

Update:

Reached out to 10 Security Litigation Firms I will update you when I hear back.

Email below:

 *Hello XX,*

*Current market manipulation is going on. GME. BB. and a few other stocks are only allowed to be sold and not purchased on platforms.*  


*CITADEL pays Robinhood for their order flows which makes up 40% of their revenue. CITADEL has huge short positions that have been getting crushed the last 4 weeks due to retail traders like myself.*  


*Robinhood and CITADEL are colluding to drive the price down by not allowing anyone else to purchase shares of those stocks.*  


*There are 100's of thousands of people getting screwed including me where I'm not able to buy and average my cost down.*  


*Robinhood TOS allows them to suppress stocks, but it is illegal when colluding with a Hedge fund to manipulate volume in favor of their shorts.*  


*Open to discussing what options I have from class action to suing on my own.*¬†¬†

*Thank you!*

Update 2: response from 1 law firm working on it.

Good Morning xxx, 

I am responding to the inquiry we received from you via FindLaw to Anthony Harwood of Harwood Law PLLC. As Tony's assistant, and I field all the initial inquiries for legal representation, and you requested to be contacted via email. Would you please provide more information regarding your potential claim.

Robinhood began to restrict retail investors from buying Gamestop and other stocks (AMC, Blackberry, etc.) this morning, while hedge funds are still able to trade these stocks. Please confirm, and can you estimate your potential losses as a result of not being able to buy shares at this time? 

What is the firm that you believe poses a conflict of interest for Robinhood and what is the conflict? 

Were you notified of the decision to limit buys by Robinhood? If so, how and when? 

Please provide any additional information that you think might be helpful in providing a fuller understanding of your situation, and we will get back to you promptly. 

Best Regards,

Update 3 My response:

Good Morning Karin,

Thanks for getting back to me. My answers in black below.

Robinhood began to restrict retail investors from buying Gamestop and other stocks (AMC, Blackberry, etc.) this morning, while hedge funds are still able to trade these stocks. Please confirm, and can you estimate your potential losses as a result of not being able to buy shares at this time? I'm currently down over $20,000 and lost out on over $500,000. I have made a post to gauge peoples losses and they are in the 100s of millions.

What is the firm that you believe poses a conflict of interest for Robinhood and what is the conflict? Robinhood is connected with CITADEL. CITADEL Hedge Fund is shorting these stocks and have lost 2-3 billion the last couple weeks due to the short squeeze. I have also read it seems to be a colluded effort by a number of brokers to block buying and only allowing selling of these specific stocks that CITADEL has interest in.. IBKR, TD, and CS seem to be working in unison to manipulate the market.

Were you notified of the decision to limit buys by Robinhood? If so, how and when? Not until 11:30am this morning where they sent a notification. You would not see the notification without pressing around the app. The notification only stated ""due to ongoing volatility some securities like AMC and GME are position closing only"". So basically they are only allowing people to sell their shares driving the price down to benefit the funds that are shorting the stock...

Please provide any additional information that you think might be helpful in providing a fuller understanding of your situation, and we will get back to you promptly. I have a few thousand people that want to join a class action lawsuit. A number of individuals are already reaching out to other law firms across the country. If you see the current news financial titants, congress members, and many others are commenting on the collusion market manipulation that is taking place on Robinhood.

I'm working to gather more information but the damages can be in the billions..

Thanks!

Please make this known and be on the lookout for a future update on details on how to join. We cannot allow them to get away with this unscathed. This is NOT a free market.

Edit 1 - Small update on actions taken so far:

1. Messaged Robinhood first asking them to stop. No response, obviously.
2. Filed an official complaint with the SEC. No response as of yet.
3. Called an attorney who specializes in class action lawsuits. Left a voicemail with him. Also called his paralegal who I also had to leave a message with.

Edit 2 - Heard back from my lawyer, we should have something officially filed by noon today. I don't know if the chance to sign on comes then or a while after but I'll let you all know.

Just so everyone knows, I'm also including \*several other stocks and trading platforms\* in this if I can. Not sure if they'll get lumped in the same lawsuit or broken into subs. Just know that we hear you and will include you. 

You are being heard. Don't give up.

Edit 3 - Removed other trading platform names.

Edit 4 - I've been informed that, if the lawsuit picks up, it will likely be consolidated to the location Robinhood does business (California, USA). I mentioned to my lawyer that this has become a global issue as evidence by those outside the USA commenting below. I'm currently concerned that I may not be able to include these areas in the suit and encourage you to file your own complaints as well. I'll keep pushing the issue, just wanted to let you all know.

Edit 5- Thank you all for your attention and participation. Also, a special thanks to those asking to donate to the cause, but I have been informed that there will be no legal fees directly billed to me in regard to this suit so the only cost to me will be time, energy, and stock losses obviously. No need for donations, but I appreciate the sentiment.

Edit 6- Looks like we're playing a waiting game at this point. The suit was filed earlier this morning but due to the insane amount of other suits being filed for the same thing, this will probably end up getting eaten up by one of the other higher profile versions. That said, don't stop fighting, record all evidence, and make sure they can't get away with this.

Many people have messaged me with additional stocks and platforms affected, I see them, there are just too many to add to this post at the time. The lawyer will get all the evidence regardless. I'm told that it could be quite some time before anything comes to fruition here so I apologize to anyone and everyone waiting in agony as I am.

Edit 7\*\*\*IMPORTANT\*\*\* The support for this is completely amazing, thank you all very much. That said, it has come to my attention that many people would like to donate financially to this cause to keep it moving. I cannot stress this enough... PLEASE DO NOT GIVE ANYONE MONEY REGARDING THIS OR ANY OTHER CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. I'm getting concerned that some people might use this as an opportunity to crowd fund a large sum of money. That is NOT what this is about. The lawyer I'm working with specifically stated that there will be no financial cost to file a class action lawsuit like this and the only time they will make anything is upon settlement of a suit, at which point they will take a cut/commission basically. I am not asking for money to help this happen and I urge all of you to completely avoid anyone who is. Yes, doing the legwork takes time and energy, but it shouldn't be exploited for financial gain.

Edit 8 - Fixing a few things cause I can't type or read apparently. Removing details of other trading platforms (other than RH) for the time being since there's conflicting info coming in and I don't want to cause confusion.

Edit 9 - Still just waiting unfortunately. If anyone sees a different lawsuit get published just reply here and I can update with the details of that one so people can get on the train asap."|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093251.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'LLC', 'NOT', 'SEC', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'USA', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'LEASE', 'DO', 'NOT', 'GIVE', 'NYONE', 'MONEY', 'RDING', 'THIS', 'OR', 'ANY', 'OTHER', 'CLASS', 'CTION', 'WSUIT', 'NOT', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']|[]

Any short squeeze in silver paper shorts would be EPIC. We know billion banks are manipulating gold and silver to cover real inflation.

All of the best mines for silver have already been depleted in recent years. There is a severe supply shortage developing. At the same time, demand is skyrocketing. Solar panels, electric cars, electronics and many other products need more silver than ever.

Both the industrial case and monetary case, debt printing has never been more favorable for the No. 1 inflation hedge Silver.

Inflation adjusted Silver should be at $1,000 instead of 25$.

Why not squeeze $SLV to real physical price.

Think about the Gainz. If you don't care about the gains, think about the banks like JP MORGAN you'd be destroying along the way.

Tldr- Corner the market. Gold Ventures thinks its possible to squeeze $SLV, FUCK AFTER SEEING $AG AND $GME EVEN I THINK WE CAN DO IT. BUY $SLV GO ALL IN TH GAINZ WILL BE UNLIMITED. DEMAND PHYSICAL IF YOU CAN. FUCK THE BANKS.

If the brokerages close trading on $SLV or various silver miners, we can continue to squeeze the market by purchasing physical silver at online or local silver/gold dealers. It all trickles into COMEX to squeeze supply.

Democrats will force the bill in the senate with just 51 votes. 

This plus housing data all released this week showed the resilience of the housing market. People want to buy homes away from covid centers and work from home will continue as mutations continue. The market has more demand than supply. People will use stimulus and this spring to build their house up for market and move to better places.

This is guaranteed to give Lowe‚Äôs and Home Depot wayyy more cash to grow and innovate their supply chain and e-commerce platforms. Attract talent from Silicon Valley. They will also increase their dividends. 

Not to mention they will receive all the customers who are refinancing right now to pull cash out to take advantage of TAX CREDITS for purchasing MADE IN AMERICA insulation, windows, doors, appliances, tiles, flooring. Who wants to pay taxes when the government is giving you free money to upgrade your house to the latest energy efficient technology. 

I have March 200 calls for Lowe‚Äôs that cover earnings and two months worth of housing data.

I don‚Äôt have Home Depot as I see the growth opportunity a bit less with them being the market leader. But I think the 300 calls for March are great.

As you can see there are 69.75M outstanding shares of which 46.89M shares are float (meaning they are available on the market to trade, other shares are held by the GME corp, CEO etc). The Shares (short) as of Jan 14 2021 shows  61.78M shares short. Meaning when there are only 46.89M shares available on the market, the shorted shares are more than the available ones. They need your shares to get out of their short positions. They have shorted more shares then the number of shares which exist. If you people HOLD or BUY more shares, the higher the value goes once the squeeze happens (When their short contracts expire, they would have to buy. If there are no shares to buy, the price goes to the Moon and beyond because of simple demand and supply. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Today was a ladder attack which showed very low volume when the stock was halted. It was there to scare off investors. Everyone should keep their shares held to themselves and buy more at any given price. May Gamestop be the most valuable company for a while on the squeeze just like Volkswagen did back in 2008.

&#x200B;

P.S ignore people who are buying BB, AMC, NOK because they think there may be a squeeze with those companies too or think they are too late to jump into GME squeeze. Remember, the squeeze will happen eventually. Volkswagen squeeze took almost 2 years, but GME will be wayyyy quicker because of the spread of the news and the sheer amount of people jumping in.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Buy GME in any way or HOLD it if you cant buy more.

&#x200B;

P.S: This is not financial advice. I LIKE THE STOCK THATS WHY I AM BUYING IT.

We all, or most of us, knew they were going to play dirty when shit starts going south for them. Friday is close. They are shitting themselves because that's the make-or-break point most likely.

Tomorrow is going to be a bloodbath, be ready for it. You may see the price swing to stupid lows but if we don't sell there's nothing they can do about it unless try more dirty tricks. 

Be prepared for the possibility that your apps like RH may have problems paying out your tendies when its all said and done. They are all in this together.

The shorts lost $14.3 bn just in January on GME. Think about it. That's the entire GDP of a smaller country like Albania or Armenia.

Whatever happens on Friday, know that we hold all the shares they need to cover their short positions and if we don't sell they'll bleed out

Usually just for a laugh as I am a stodgy buy and hold guy and don't speculate often. When I saw the $GME shit happening a week ago I thought it was pure stupidity and was not planning on investing. In fact, I bought some $GME puts (which I've since sold since somehow they've gone up based on volatility) betting against the crowd here.

However, what has started as a decentralized short squeeze has morphed into a class movement. I'm a big populist and think we need big changes in this country, especially a transfer of wealth and power from the elites to the people. When this morphed into a class movement I became obsessed. However, I still wasn't going to buy in because I shy away from speculating on ultra risky stuff like this. But when Robinhood and all the other major brokerages colluded to cause a massive sell off, that's when it became a matter of principle. I've watched all day as the stock has remained relatively stable on very little volume. People are holding despite wall street twisting your arm and trying to make you tap out by only allowing you to sell. It's a beautiful thing to see.

I missed the boat on this, I was preoccupied the last few months with my wife's cancer battle

But this situation is the first time I've felt like I have any sort of purpose since my wife passed away earlier this month.

All i have is one share, but thank you for letting me feel invigorated.  I don't have my livelihood riding on this.  But for the first time in a long while, I feel a fire inside me.  Thank you for this.

She always used to tease me for my obsessions with meme stocks, but I know she'd have loved to hear me rant about this bullshit in endless anti-establishment screeds.  I won't get to hear her laugh at me for it, but the least we can do is burn Melvin and Citadel to ashes.

She was stubborn as hell, and I hope everyone else here will join me in stubbornly refusing to sell.

Please don't send me money, thankfully, medical bills are not an issue as she had excellent insurance until the end.   I will be ok financially, as well even if im still making adjustments.  If you wanted to fund shares for me, buy them for yourself, because we're all in this together.  I love this stock and i want everyone to have some!

If you have another cause and this made you want to give, give to them instead.  I very much appreciate the sentiments though.

We saw. We bought. We held. 

They hemorrhaged funds and bailed each other out. 

We laughed and bought more.

They manipulated the stock down with short ladders and doubling down on their short interest. 

We bought the dips and began to squeeze. 

They convinced our platforms to block us from buying, even forced some to sell. 

We said fuck robinhood et all, rode the wave, and bought and held with platforms that support the people (shoutout fidelity). 

What else have they left to do? The brokers who still allow free trading wouldn‚Äôt dare face the same backlash robinhood and others have received. Hedge funds can keep doubling down on their shorts and try to manipulate their stock but they know we‚Äôll hold.

Tomorrow we face the possibility of a massive squeeze fueled by short coverage and the inevitable gamma squeeze that will come from thousands of call contracts being exercised. Some things to note - MMs buy 95% of the underlying shares represented by call contracts to hedge each time they're bought; as we've seen in the past few days, in this case MMs are almost the same 'group' as the shorts. This throws a wrench in things that I don't know how to interpret. Anyone? They worked together today to lock us out, tank the price, and make a 100 million dollar short sale while liquidating massive share quantities at a price so low it margin called anyone holding that many shares on margin in the first place. We can expect buy lockouts and other bullshit but the gamma squeeze remains **inevitable**. The gamma squeeze will not necessarily lead to or indicate the short squeeze happening, no one knows. It seems like the most important thing each investor has to prepare for on their own is an exit strategy for call contracts expiring tomorrow (regardless of squeeze height) and shares (in the case of the actual squeeze happening) if that investor wants to sell.

As has been explained here a few times now, shorts need our shares - period. Tomorrow they will buy shares and they will buy contracts to convert into shares. They must meet the prices we set - again, period. Hypothetically, if every single person that is HOLDING shares set the sell limit to 10K (which RH now prevents as an 'aggressive' limit), then shorts would have no option but to pay that price if they want to cover OR - and this is important - they CAN WAIT FOR HOLDERS TO DEFECT AND SELL EARLY, UNDERCUTTING THE SELL WALL. The **prisoners' dilemma** describes the problem of achieving maximal collective outcomes in situations where individual self-interest comes into play. In the event of a squeeze, all holders will be faced with the question of when to sell. Even if a sell wall was established by 95% of holders at 1K, if 5% of holders create sell orders at 500, the shorts will purchase all of those, and then someone holding at 1K (in the original 95%) says 'fuck, I don't want to miss out' and lowers their price to 600. Let's say 5% of that group holding at 1K does that. Now 90% of the holders are still at 1K but 10% of all shares have now been sold at or below 600. This would cascade and bring the price down.

We are NOT a hedge fund or a hive mind and there is no way to ensure we all sell at the same time and I am not telling anybody when to sell. This is all entirely hypothetical. I'm not encouraging a specific price point ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm merely describing a predicament we face - a market phenomenon, perhaps. Right now if you look at the GME order book, the sell 'wall' looks like a staircase, moving upwards at a pretty natural slope. That kind of sell wall will not produce the optimal collective outcome in terms of sale price in the case of a squeeze. In that scenario, the actual sale prices would likely never reach the top. What **would** produce the optimal group outcome is a true sell wall, where limit orders are **FLAT** until a **massive Kingdom of the Fucking North Wall** at a single price. Thoughts? I personally just love the fucking stock. Play with the bull you get the fucking horns.

EDIT: [https://imgur.com/gallery/wLMohne](https://imgur.com/gallery/wLMohne) this is the current sell staircase versus a sell wall. NONE of this post is financial advice. I'm just a retard drawing in my notes app.

TL;DR at the bottom.

I had one Jan 29 20c option I've been holding since GME was somewhere around 18, and I originally planned to exercise (and I wish I followed my plan).

Today at market open, I got too nervous about the impending market manipulation and tried to sell.

**1st Order:** Sell for 310 limit (30k profit on a $300 investment) while there was a bid for 318 and the stock was at 320 (no halt, this was right after open).

**Order Rejected**

Stock started rising again and I was kinda glad the order didn't go through, even though it seemed really fishy. 

I later learned through my broker that the rejection code from NYSE basically meant my limit was ""too aggressive"" and that's why it was rejected. **WTF**

**2nd Order:** 1200 Limit, fuck it.

**Order open/accepted** 

In regards to the rejection justification for the first order: *top kek*

Stock starts free falling.

Mind starts racing.

> Selling at 1200 would have been life changing directly.

> Selling at 300 would allow for some great investments into myself that could be life changing down the line.

> Selling at 100 would be a very nice profit still, even if it was just at 400 a few minutes ago, but who the fuck knows what kinda shady ass shit is going on behind the scenes at the moment while most US retail investors are basically shut out except for selling.

Stock hits ~100 and halts again.

**3rd Order:** Sell at 103 limit (matching a current bid).

**Order Executed**

Halt ends, stock shoots up. Hole in stomach and panic sets in once again, but in the other direction. Realize I've made a huge mistake.

**4th Order**: Buy at 120 limit (matching a current ask).

**Order Rejected**

**5th Order**: Buy at 140 limit (matching a current ask).

**Order Rejected**

**4th Order**: Buy at 160 limit (matching a current ask).

**Order Rejected**

The contract is now too expensive for me.

That was it.

**Now, I made a 10k profit from a $300 investment and I don't want to bitch about that.** I'll be happy about it soon enough once I'm less emotional about what could have been.

**But: What the everloving fuck happened to my orders?**

I've never had an order be rejected before, just maybe not filled if my limits were off.

Just so happens the only order that went through today was the worst one I made and all the others (realistic ones) got rejected, so I'm indeed salty especially the 310 sale in the morning didn't go through, as that basically cost me $20k, $10k if I held. If I thought I could sue the NYSE I would...

So, can anyone explain to me what happened here so I can know what to expect and act accordingly if I'm ever in a similar situation again?

Thanks and godspeed to all of you who are still in this game. I hope GME surpasses my moonshot 1200 order and makes you all as rich as it will make the shorters poor.

tl;dr, in 2020 the original founder (after being gone for years and did nothing to contribute to the sub), along with a couple of mods, attempted to monetize the sub for personal gains. Users and other mods fought back. Hundreds of users got mass banned for speaking out, mods who spoke out got removed as mods. With some help from users, mods found precedent of another sub creator getting banned for trying to monetize a sub and sent plea to Reddit admins. Reddit admins banned offenders and gave sub back to the good mods. 

u/SpeaksInBooleans (RIP) investigated the circumstance of the events and made video exposing the offenders:

Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: 

__We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.__ Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1.	‚Å†Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.
2.	‚Å†Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.
3.	‚Å†Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.
4.	‚Å†Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.
5.	‚Å†At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.
6.	‚Å†Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.
7.	‚Å†The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  

__I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user ([u/zshub](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/gl5vgof/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)) who said a market sell order executed at $2600 for him.  Also, someone else for over [$5,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7em07/coworker_had_a_limit_executed_of_a_little_over/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) per share. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?__ It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

[Listen to this ](https://youtu.be/7RH4XKP55fM)to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

__TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.__

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.

The whole Internet.


Sometimes, when you're in the middle of a battle, you forget to take a look around and see what's happening. I don't think everyone here has fully grasped just how close we came to losing today. This thing was **over.**


We preach diamond hands, but we also saw everything that we've worked so hard for wiped out with the most blatantly illegal manipulation in market history. We couldn't buy. We could only watch as our beloved stock started dropping from the all-time high to a crushing low.


The people won't invest if they can't trust the market. And that's where we were. That's where I, personally, was. I was VERY close to paper handing and selling when we hit $112 (Sorry).


But then...an absolute **MIRACLE.**


A distress beacon that went out from America's allies to the entire world will be remembered as the single greatest moment in the history of the Internet. You came by the tens of thousands from literally all corners of the globe. And many of these were purchases of only a couple shares of stock. Peanuts.


But together, you absolutely **OBLITERATED** the opposing force. We watched and could only cheer you on as you stopped the short attack in its tracks and then gained back everything they'd taken from us.



You guys single-handedly reached out to America and said, ""We got this.""

Price swings from 420-136 and you see a house you could buy disappear.

You see those medical bills your family is underneath come back.

You see rent.

You see the price of formula.

The massive price swings are literally horrifying, especially for us.

So try to keep in mind that keeping yourself physically prepared to deal with it is part of winning this war.

All they've got is theatrics and price manipulation but its hard to watch.

So to get ready for the kind of war we're going into tomorrow:

1. Sleep if you can. At least get some rest. Your brain without sleep has poorer responses to stress and makes worse decisions.
2. Eat. Plan an easy breakfast. Remind yourself to eat too, the adrenaline is going to mask your appetite.
3. Monitor your substances. Your adrenaline will work as a stimulant, not need to pound red bull all day. Its just make you jittery and more vulnerable to their only weapon: financial horror and stress.
4. Plan breaks and places to do it where you're away from shit. Take a walk or a drive. Sit on the porch and spark one for 10 minutes while MM's try to scare you.
5. Visualization. Open your brokerage. Look at the GME price while breathing deeply. Now imagine it being $96 dollars. Keep breathing deeply. Now picture it being 6969669.42. Keep breathing deeply.
6. Definitely jerk off.

No matter what happens with the price take care of yourself. Don't let these ghouls get in your heads.

We got this.

I'm known for never getting the fuck off this sub and collecting tax payer money as I do it. Seriously you'll see me here 24 fucking 7 even when I'm ""working""

I'm going to give you the quick rundown on Wallstreetbets culture for you newcomers to get acclimated or if you're a CNBC boomer not knowing what the fuck is going on in this sub.

# First of all lets go over lingo/slang:

**FD** (stands for ""f"" word (no not fuck the other F word) delight)

\-*To buy an FD is to buy a weekly option that is so fucking retarded it might just work*

**Retard**

\-*It means your fucking stupid and don't know what the fuck you're doing*

**Autistic**

\-*Use autistic to describe someone that actually does due diligence and knows what they are doing*

**First one is free**

\-*A phenomena where you are so retarded and don't know what the fuck your doing you somehow make money on your first trade*

**Ban**

\-*When you say or ask something so fucking retarded someone has requested a mod to ban you*

**Diamond Hands** üíé‚úã

\-*It means you never sell. Your hands are literally made of diamonds*

**Toilet Paper Hands üßª‚úã**

\-*You sell at the slightest red tick because you're overleveraged and are a pussy.*

**In Scrambles**

\-*when somebody has made a poor decision and is regretting it*

**Europoors**

\-*When the European stock markets open up and they start selling because they lack economic stimulus.*

**Ameririch**

\-*When US stock markets open and they buy up what Europoors sold*

**YOLO**

\-*$400 into GME weeklies is not a YOLO you dumb fuck. A YOLO should be atleast 4 digits and represent 98-100% of your account*

**$ROPE**

\-*what you buy when you make a poor decision*

**Smooth Brain**

\-*apparently the grooves in your brain determines your intelligence. To have a smooth brain means to have no grooves which means you're fucking retarded.*

**FOMO (fear of missing out)**

\-*when everybody getting paid and you feel left out.*

**Guh**

\-*when you account goes from $4000 to $0 in 30 seconds*

**DD** (Due Diligence)

\-*It means doing your homework on a specific stock or the overall market*

**BTFD** (Buy the Fucking Dip)

\-*Something Warren Buffet said*

**Plunge Protection Team (PPT)**

\-*When the money printer gets turned on and prevents a drill from drilling further*

**Tendies**

\-*money*

**Mooning üöÄüöÄüöÄ**

\-*Either means a stock went up 0.05% or 600%*

**Drilling / Drill team 6**

\-*Either means a stock went down -0.05% or -50%*

**Pleas fly again**

\-*what you say when your stock takes a shit*

**""We like the stock""**

\-*Recent meme popularized by Jim Cramer in regards to Gamestop when he tried to imitate Wallstreetbets users*

**Jerome Powell / Daddy**

\-*The chairman of the Federal Reserve. Blessed us with 0% interest rates causing stocks to only go up. Literally prints money.*

**SEC (Securities exchange commission)**

\-*Stock market police*

**Black Swan**

\-*when your chillin and some shit pops off that makes the stock market moon or drill*

**Deepfuckingvalue**

\-*Autist who held GME for nearly 2 years*

**Mods are gay**

\-*self explanatory*

**Buy High Sell low**

*-what you do as a newcomer.*

&#x200B;

No you don't need to report users who call you retarded.

No you don't need to report users that say they fucked your wife while her boyfriend watches

No you don't need to report users for saying you probably do blowjobs behind the wendys.

If somebody says ""nobody tell him"" they are not being a dick you are just so fucking retarded because your question is probably basic shit you should know before investing.

# Gang Life

On your adventure throughout Wallstreetbets you'll notice some retards representing different types of ""gangs"" heres a quick guide to what they stand for.

**Bear Gang / Gay bears / Virgin traders üåàüêª**

\-*These guys get hard when stocks go down*

*Note: ""gay bear"" in NOT an alternative to calling someone ""retard"". Being called gay bear is 100x worse, true story.*

**Bull Gang / Big Dongus Crew üêÇ**

\-*These guys get hard when stocks go up*

**Kang Gang ü¶ò**

\-*These guys get hard when stocks go way up and then way down*

**Theta Gang Œ∏**

\-*These guys get hard when stocks go sideways*

**Cash gang üíµ**

\-*These guys get hard watching other people get hard*

**Late-night gang**

\-*Any retard on wallstreetbets between the hours of 1am pst / 4am est - 4am pst / 7am est*

**West coast gang**

\-*Usually a chad who lives in California or Washington. Heavy presence between 12am pst and 4am pst*

**East coast gang**

\-*Losers that have to wake up at 4 in the morning to look at the pre-market*

**Pajama Traders**

\-*Usually references people who trade futures or those that trade premarket*

**Silver Surfers üèÑ**

\-*People that invest in silver commodity*

**Steel Gang**

\-*People that invest in Vale, X or other stocks that go up when steel is in demand*

**Corn Gang**üåΩ

\-*People that invest in corn*

**Gourd Gang**

\-[*People that invest in Gourd*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzoh1c/i_am_financially_ruined_agricultural_futures/)

**Tanker Gang**üõ¢Ô∏è

\-*People that invest in tankers. rip.*

# Surviving as a newcomer

Don't ask retarded questions that are basic such as:

* ""What is an option?""
* ""Should I buy X stock?""
* ""Is it too late?""
* ""What is IV?""
* ""Why can't I trade"" and the market is fucking closed
* ""What are futures?""

All this basic shit will piss off some degenerates because if you don't know any of this there is really no reason for you to be throwing 10k at weeklies you'll lose 99% of the time.

&#x200B;

Not only is it against the rules but nobody gives a fuck about your political thoughts. The only thing we care about on this sub is fucking gay bears and losing money. With this much people in a sub there is bound to be political commentary and I'd advise you to take it to a different sub.

Worked @ Merrill as an analyst from ** - **.

I also like to keep it concise so follow along. This ain't a fucking Qanon fan fiction.

Disclaimer: I own GME. This is not financial advice. This is just some dude chatting with his old buddies.

---------------------------------------------------------
1) **Robinhood, restrictions, suppression**: 

When you place an order through RH, Citadel or some other HFT front runs your trade and pockets the spread; However, the transaction is not complete.

Enter: Clearing house. The clearing house is the intermediary between the counter-parties. Because they stand between sellers & buyers, they have very defined levels of risk, risk management and regulation to be in front of.  The clearing house is who gives you the ""title"" for your shares, the folks who make it official.

**What Likely Happened**: The risk department retard @ the clearing house, who does jack shit all year other than flag Stacy's trade so he can get some face time with her runs to the C-Suite frazzled; He has looked at option open interest expiring this week, has done the math and there simply isn't enough float for GME in anyway, shape or form; turns out WSB is printing out their stock certificates and burying them in the Mojave Desert. It's simply not enough.

In addition, they got a Snapchat from SEC/OCC which said hey, if you fucking keep selling open positions, you're on your own; we ain't gonna help you. SEC is sneaky like that; they like sending messages through the backdoor, not the front because they used to be hedgies themselves. If you're not following, Front door is making a public statement while the backdoor is a threat sent to an intermediary who you and millions of investors don't even know exists.

So, they call up the risk department at RH and tell em to stop fucking selling GME, there simply isn't enough float, the SEC told the clearing house they're on their own and who tf is gonna take the blame/liability if there's a ""failure to deliver""? 

---------------------------

2) **Failure to Deliver**:

This is a pretty fucking big deal. Bigger than you imagine, because it's basically a slam-dunk law suit. 

Failure to deliver means that one of the counterparties (in this case, the firm who sold you the option, RH or the clearing house) has failed to deliver you a contractually obligated position, profit or certificate. Since there's no float and ITM calls get exercised by HFT bots at the end of the day, how in the fucking hell are they gonna deliver the option holders their contractually obligated merchandise if there is no merchandise to be delivered? There simply isn't enough for everyone. Thousands (or possibly hundreds of thousands) of failures to deliver =  big risk


---------------------------

3) **Liability**: 

You must be asking so what? Fuck them; They should be the ones figuring it out and they gotta give me, the customer, the right to choose or whatever the fuck; That sounds great in a boomer fashion but it's not that simple. Robinhood is contractually obligated to deliver you those shares or positions. If they fail to, they become liable for any losses or profits that you may have endured and they will LOSE in court cause they FAILED to DELIVER. How many people have options on GME on RH? Half? Imagine if half of these fine RH customers were legally owed benefits and they were engaged in DDoS style lawsuits involving Robinhood or the clearing house. There would be no Robinhood left. There would likely be no clearing house left. Robinhood is also a shitshow of a company, so they likely didn't even have additional collateral to put up to the clearing house for normal share buying and selling on the meme tickers and since they bank with T-Mobile, they had to pull the plug.

Hence: Bad Decision > Bankruptcy or worse (WSB finds Vlad's mom and becomes her boyfriend collectively)


I personally don't believe it was out of malice or a coordination for RH; there's definitely coordination all around, but occam's razor says this is not such an ordeal.

---------------------------


Couple of semi-related notes:

-Fuck Billionaires. Parasites of modern society, simply existing to leech off every slurp of alpha and take up resources meant for billions of poor people. Something is needed. Whatever is needed to discourage hoarding of resources of this tiny fucking planet.

-I very much doubt that Ken Griffin and Citadel (the HF) would engage in blatant market manipulation or coercion of Robinhood or other brokers to make a few bucks on Gamestop or AMC. They cleared over 6 billion net last year, so just logically, it seems pretty unlikely to risk it for this. It is also very unlikely that Citadel Securities would engage in illegal behavior for the profit of Citadel, simply because it's such a money maker. If you were an evil genius, would you let your money maker go to shit because you were getting squeezed on some short?

-The media just wants clicks and engagement, so they will bring the worst people on, simply to pad their own bottom line. Don't get engaged. Don't give in to them. Be the captain of your own ship and fuck over wall-street however you please.

-The restrictions on the others tickers is likely proactive, not reactive. 

- **TL;DR**: There's simply not enough float and the broker/clearing house will fail to deliver on a large scale if they keep letting new positions be opened, hence restrictions.

- **What will happen now**: Based on my previous short squeezes, Friday (tomorrow) will be nuts; All this gamma has to go somewhere and since there's not enough float, I'm guessing up."|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093229.csv|StockTicker|['I']|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'RH', 'HFT', 'GME', 'WSB', 'OCC', 'SEC', 'RH', 'GME', 'SEC', 'RH', 'ITM', 'HFT', 'LOSE', 'AILED', 'LIVER', 'GME', 'RH', 'RH', 'S', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'AMC']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC']

GME dropped over 75% from its high not because just RH did this, and we all know it.

MOST BROKERS DID THIS. MOST OF THEM.

Now - go look at the front page of Reddit, the front page of your favorite news source, and the tweets of your favorite politicians. 95% of mentions of these shenanigans mention ONLY RH.

Why's that? Hell, you KNOW why deep down, but let's spell it out.

These prominent people - politicians, celebs, rich people, etc. - who are suddenly on your side would **love** to see **only RH** bite the dust. RH already had been disrupting the industry and taking business away from the established brokers who were charging ridiculous fees from back when you had to hop on the phone and call a broker to perform trades.

The second RH goes away, and other newer ones like WeBull get similarly targeted and scrutinized, what'll happen? Return of the $8+ per trade $1 per contract BS as the norm. Fees that go down with the more money spent, because brokers loooove rich people, and hate us and want to rake as much as they can from us.

Should RH get reamed? Absolutely. Should all the other brokers that pulled these shenanigans get reamed too? You betcha. And right now, that's clearly not going to happen. I've not seen a single politician, including AOC, mention ANY broker other than RH. Hell, a congressperson drafted a fucking letter about troubling/concerning yada yada about RobinHood. Only RobinHood. **Again, MOST BROKERS did this.**

Frankly, ANY broker that pulled this shit should be shut the fuck down. If not by the law, by their customers getting the fuck away from their thieving asses.

So, did your broker do this to you too? List 'em here. Hell, make a separate post about them. Upvote all of them. Let's not let them get away with this. They're trying to sneak out of a war they started and present RH as the lone culprit and make you feel warm and happy about class action lawsuits that'll get you a baconator in about 5 years. Don't let them.

It's clear the media and politicians all intend for those other brokers to get away with it. The ONLY way they won't is for us to plaster their names everywhere and make it IMPOSSIBLE to ignore."|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093251.csv|StockTicker|['NOT', 'GME', 'NOT']|['GME']|['GME', 'RH', 'ALSO', 'GME', 'GME', 'RH', 'MOST', 'OKERS', 'DID', 'THIS', 'MOST', 'OF', 'THEM', 'ONLY', 'RH', 'KNOW', 'RH', 'RH', 'BS', 'RH', 'AOC', 'ANY', 'RH', 'MOST', 'OKERS', 'ANY', 'RH', 'ONLY', 'SIBLE']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME']

Mine is a common NYC story.   I went to Yale and Stanford, coming from working class roots out of nowhere.  I didn't have a plan for after college, so I did NYC banking work like everyone similar at the time (it was a few years before everyone decided they should go to DotCom companies).  The  ""I don't have a plan"" on campus interview train of my day usually led to ""easy"" money doing bank work in Manhattan.  I'm older than nearly everyone on this sub.  I did the 100 hour weeks (before blackberrys and iphones existed en masse, so you had to actually sit at your fucking desk all night).  I made some money, but not master of the universe money.   Enough to be comfortable, even in NYC (it was cheaper in the 90s).  You could have seen me at Anna's in the Financial District in the late 90s.  It's a Dos Toros now.

I stuck with it.  Went to grad school and back. I moved uptown and into private equity buyout work, at a well known shop in midtown.  You could have found me in the 2000s with one of those (in retrospect) stupid looking Hermes ""H"" belts we all had those days (tie to match).   By this time I'd lost my drinking pretense.  I'd get drunk at a hole called Jimmy's corner.  Just tried to get through the day.  Hated every minute of it.  But I was decent at the jobs and got many promotions.

I got carry on the right deal, and I moved out of PE the second I got paid.  I'm in a completely second career now by choice, and I have never looked back.  I left a lot on the table, but I fucking hated working those deals.  Soul crushing.   Buy a company, fire people and make short term decisions that will bite company in ass 10 years down the road, sell company in 5 years.  Rinse repeat.

I've seen a lot of shit.  I've been with our advisors at Lazard trying to bullshit our way through 12 week cashflow statement to save a shitty company and get a rescue package at 2am.  I've been in a Wachtell conference room at 3am hammering final points to sign before an 830am pre-market takeover announcement.   I nearly tripped over the Blackstone 3 story sky lobby stairs at one point.    I went to closing dinners at every place that was cool 20 years ago but are probably sad or closed now (BTW:  you kids should lobby to bring back closing dinners; they went away in 07 but are fucking awesome).   I'd put my bona fides up against anyone (almost anyone?) here.

&#x200B;

***Most importantly, I've seen a lot of shifty, disingenuous bullshit.  But major brokerages closing trading today was probably the worst thing I ever saw.    It's a terrible investment and I'm going to lose money, but I threw some $$$ down to protest.  Fuck those guys.***

And today, they de-platformed the average investor and literally removed his ability to trade.

But now I feel that something has fundamentally changed. People are joining purely to take a stand against being screwed over for millennia.

Just look at the recent posts. You've got people who've never even owned a single stock going balls deep into GME just to make a statement. Think about that. **You've got regular working class people willing and happy to lose their hard-earned money just to take a stand.** Last week I was worried the shorts would get off easy buying back shares from holders trying to lock in life-changing profits. Now, half of the apes aren't even here to make money anymore. **We're diamond hands üíéü§öin this bitch just because we're tired of getting dicked.**

Again this is just hypothetical. I have no idea if anything like this would be possible even in a parallel universe. 

What if the SEC realized that the infinity squeeze has come to fruition and tells shareholders that they can either engage a long drawn out decade of class action lawsuits, uncertainty, and frustration in which the lawyers will get $169Billion and each share holder would probably get $69/share, a coupon for chicken tendies from the infamous ""RobbingHood's Tendy Cart"", an office chair, 3 reddit gold, and an inoperable Bloomberg terminal.

OR


They (whomever they are) can ""admit no fault"" but each shareholder gets a settlement of $X's /share. All partys then go forward and navigate equity investing within all of the new rules and regulations which will inevitably be forced upon us by politicians and an inept SEC which didn't enforce the rules that were already in place.

<deep breath>

So, if we agree to accept a random # per share. Say,.... $4,206.90 and assuming 69,000,000 shares.

Total payout would be $293,438,250,000 ish. Approximately Verizon's market cap. 

Looks like a decent starting point to me.


*the preceding was a work of fiction. Not an acceptance of any terms, advice or a Llama. Any similarities between settlements living or dead is kind of stupid.

I've been shoulder to shoulder with all of you through this mess. I've been hammering way OTM weekly calls in volume. This is the most fun I've ever had.

Through the madness of this past week of trading I've managed to claw my way back from oblivion. $GME has done a couple 10 baggers for me this week alone. I love you all and I'm happy to see you all again. So many new faces. I'm proud of each and every one of you.

I'm currently holding about $50,000 in calls on $SLV  ..and $15,000 in OTM weeklies on $GME.  Rookie numbers I know, but I just got my legs back. I'll be running again in no time.

LETS FUCKING GO! GAMMA SQUEEZE UNTIL THEY BEG FOR MERCY!

EDIT: Thank you for the outpouring of love and support, It is actually giving me goosebumps reading through the comments. I feel like I just came home.  I'm going to bed but I'll try to keep up and respond to everyone. God speed and have a BEAUTIFUL FUCKING FRIDAY!

EDIT #2: I didn't think this post would blow up like it did, I don't have the time to go through every post and thank you all individually while deep dicking the market with OTM calls so just know that if you post here I can promise you I read your words and took them to heart.  


EDIT #3: I literally cannot smoke enough weed to calm down right now. I feel like I have rocket fuel in my blood.

For those who got in at <$50/share and made 10-50x on options. Congratulations.

I am not saying the populist anger isn‚Äôt justified or that our system is not flawed or that these hedge funds didn‚Äôt fuck up by shorting something with such a large short float. But sometimes it‚Äôs good to stay calm and analyze things rationally and consider the following opinions from someone who was burned by the short selling ban in 2008 and lost my shirt with my puts in 2012 betting on a cascading bank failure in European when Draghi announced LTRO. There are a lot of things that can go wrong with the infinite money machine thesis.

The more the price of GME rises, the likelihood that the SEC will institute a short term trading ban on the stock increases. But vegaseller, you say, we will just Hold and when it resumes  our infinite money wormhole will work again, time is on our side, the shorts have massive margins interests which are compounding.

The problem will be when a private deal is negotiated between GME management and a short seller consortium. It is highly likely there are already negotiations underway between some individual short sellers and the company on a private deal to issue new shares at a significant premium, although much lower than the current market price. Management will be happy to double the shares outstanding at anywhere from $20-100 shares/share, a considerably discount to the current share price. Their concerns are retiring their existing debts and generating cash on their balance sheet for a pivot rather than maintaining their current shares price.

And the higher the run-up in GME share price, the greater the incentive for short sellers to form a consortium and reach a private deals with management and the greater incentive for management to close a deal towards a higher price range. Once a deal is largely settled, they will loop the SEC in to institute a temporary trading halt on the stock. 

If this happens, you guys would be left holding the bag and the share price could easily drop to $10-$50.

There is no shame in taking some money out. Just here to point out how the shorts can still get out at a much lower cost than you think. Again it‚Äôs just food for thought, make your own judgement."|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093312.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['I', 'I', 'LTRO', 'GME', 'SEC', 'GME', 'GME', 'SEC']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME']

‚Ä¢ EPS has grown a significant 84% since last year

‚Ä¢ NIO‚Äôs revenue grew by 56% since last year

‚Ä¢ EV stocks are an incredibly popular buy &amp; hold 

‚Ä¢ NIO‚Äôs revenue, deliveries, and growth are all expected to grow significantly over the next few years as we shift to an all-electric age

‚Ä¢ NIO has is financially healthy and able to meet its short-term obligations with a quick ratio of 2.33

‚Ä¢ Current quick ratio in the industry is 1.37, so NIO is already 87% ahead of its peers

‚Ä¢ NIO is currently a stable company making consistent progress, making it very unlikely for bankruptcy

‚Ä¢ NIO is in a massive up-trend, currently consolidating in the 55-60 area making this an ideal ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù level

‚Ä¢ NIO‚Äôs current consolidation and lack of news coverage means that NIO is not high in the spotlight, this makes it ideal to buy because as soon as good news hits the market, the price will rise significantly. It‚Äôs much better to buy now than the moment news comes out

‚Ä¢ NIO‚Äôs delivery numbers are accelerating exponentially

‚Ä¢ Not everyone is quite convinced with EV‚Äôs, so the moment they become more relevant or ‚Äúless risky‚Äù in the coming years more investors will look to buy into EV‚Äôs

‚Ä¢ NIO rose a total of 1,100% in 2020 making it one of the fastest growing EV stocks in the market

‚Ä¢ We have an incredibly strong zone of demand in the $50 area in NIO with loads of limit buy orders

‚Ä¢ There is a small supply zone in the $64 and the $67 areas, as soon as we break past those we will soar past uranus üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

‚Ä¢ Expected to hit record deliveries this month of January!

Edit: my position is 400 NIO shares.
         Go ahead and buy GME for now, the point of this post was for the
         purpose of DD for you all. 
$NIO is currently trading at $56

Edit 2: NIO is announcing its deliveries for jan 2021 on Feb 1st. Earnings report will be in march. 

Edit 3: NIO posted a potential easter egg for its announcement on deliveries [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/l9kncu/nio_record_deliveries_jan_2021_source_nio_app/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) is a link to the NIO subreddit claiming record deliveries in a specific region.

this will probably get buried but i feel the need to write it

Disclaimer: I AM NOT ACTIVELY INVESTED IN $GME $AMC ET CETERA. NOR DO I HAVE CONTRACTS.

Let us Begin.

I have been lurking on this sub for 7 years and some change. Most of you are probably too new here to remember DryShips (wow what a time), AMD when it was 8 dollars, the Marijuana craze, or the many other notable time periods on here. These past few weeks have been incredible to watch, not in a positive or negative way, truly here to watch the madness.

I hope you all make money whatever the play. Money grows on trees in this economic climate. Go get some, but don't let the ladder fall.

Lots of anger here today, blaming institutions, blaming individuals, blaming the lizard overlordz for your losses. Listen, I get it, no one LIKES to lose money.

Markets have not been rational for a few years... So I ask, where was this anger when Yield Curves inverted and the vix has been through the roof for the last couple years? whats that? your account was green? oh ok then. I say that not to disparage but rather to inform the subreddit as a whole that you guys have blinders on that hide what you do not want to see (confirmation bias).

What we DO NOT need is for congress to swoop in and save the day. only thing that type of intervention brings is the common man holding a bag that that causes you to lose sleep. Robinhood was wrong to suspend trading. but it was completely legal. they are a company that has to make money. (If something is free that is not free anywhere else, then it is most definitely NOT free, as you all saw today)

People are trading as they drive down the interstate. we have never seen this before on such a massive scale. but remember, the market will always REMIND you of your mortality. it may not be today, or tomorrow or even next week, but the market will humble even the very best.

This does end the way you want it to end. no one will go to jail. corporations come out on top. remember that. it's a beautiful thing for some but a depressing thought for others. But it is the way humans have operated for millennia. **the smaller tribe always got defeated and beheaded and raped by the larger powerful tribe.**

GOOD LUCK TO ALL, YOU BEAUTIFUL MOTHERFUCKING RETARDS!!!

I hope this doesn't get buried, but it probably will.

feel free to ask me all the questions you want in comments, I will do my best to respond to them all.

I'm going agaisnt the grain here, but I'm a fellow looser dropping tens of keys for years with you guys, so just inverse me, I'm a good counter indictor.

**What's going on?**

[We won... kinda](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7f95j/ladies_and_gentlemen_we_got_them/). The short squeeze and gamma squeeze both happened. Yesterday market broke. Unfortunately the real winners are big players like [BlackRock, Vanguard](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/l6hm3b/they_are_now_claiming_the_wsb_of_hacking_this_is/gl1xjzh/?context=3).

To avoid it all going in flames Market Makers and then Clearing Houses (new things to learn for you I know) the real players just decided to excercise their contracts and require full deposits from their clients (the small fries like WebBull and Robinhood).

Have they not do that GME would be already orbiting Mars, not Moon. Fucking Mars. Wait no, fuck Mars, it'd be orbiting Pluto.

The problem is with the infinite squeeze is ... nothing is fucking infinite. Sure you can *say* that the potential for losses for shorts is infinite, except when you are over 100% of losses and you are a corporation, the worst that happens is you close the door, and put up a sign saying ""fuck you. sue me"". You must understand that. We've liquidated few funds, we'll liquidate few more, but in the end there's simply not enough shares to go around.

**Ok. So what's going to happen?**

Next week price will go up. Definitely üöÄüöÄüöÄ to the stratosphere(1000+), maybe üöÄüöÄüöÄ to the Moon(5000+), unlikely üöÄüöÄüöÄ to Mars (10k-20k).

Then the real players: Vanguards, BlackRock will start dumping mass amount of shares.

Now listen to this. Did you ever wonder how 130% short interest was created?

Alice has 1 share of GME. Bob comes and borrows a share, and then immidietly sells it to the Celine. Celine then lends it to Daniel, who then goes areound and immidietly sells it again to Edgar. Voila: 200% short interest out of 1 share with no naked short selling.

**BUT** it works the other way too. Short seller Bob, buys a share because he has to, swallows a loss, but you know what? now he has a share, a share that's going up, so he waits one day and sells it for a profit ... to short seller Daniel, who turns around and does the same thing. Unwinding two shorts. Those two shorts still need to be returned .. eventually, but they can play the momentum as well as you do. So even getting their opsions excercised is not the end for them,

It takes days to unwind those kind of trades, that's why this squeeze will take days if not weeks.

So should you üíéüôå to win? You'd think that  [Red is You](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l75z1d/volkswagen_short_squeeze_from_2008_the_red_is_you/)  look numbers even match up! The problem is that GME is not going back to 200 or 300 at which you bought in. It's going back to 20-40 in few months (yea, yea, shitron, they are right the timing is just off, which is the same as being wrong).

Now the hedge funds will get liquidated, sooner or later, if not on GME then on the next meme stock. But they do not **only** short. They als ohave long positions, those positions will get liquidated - that's why APPL is selling off among other things. What does that mean?

Wide market selloff. Markets **will** go down, and those people that invest in APPL do have stop losses. The stop losses will trigger, market will go down more.

**Ok retard so what should I do**?

*You're playing casino with disposable money*? üíéüôå till Mars

*You're here to support Vanguard (because their ETFs are RAD) and want to fuck the system?* üíéüôå till Mars

*You are just here for the ride and memes*? üíéüôå till Mars

*You are here because your Aunt gave you some pocket money*? üíéüôå

*You are here because you got stimulus check and you're up more then 200%?* Sell enough to take out your initial investment then üíéüôå till Moon

*You are here because you're bored?  Are you using big boy exchange and can actually buy?* Sell GME 400$ - Buy 2 \* GME 200$. Rinse. Repeat. Trade a fucking volatility because it's stupid and it's jsut going up, so buy every dip, then sell ... to buy more dips.

**Bread Line/Wendys:**

Is it your ""fuck you money?"" üíéüôå

Is it your financial independence money? Sell half of it for 400-500$ rest of it is now your fuck you money so üíéüôå

Don't get caught bag holding for Vanguard and Black Rock. Short the wide markets.

**Positions:**

Short S&P, Short Nasdaq, Short DOW, Long Gold & Silver. Long the meme: GME, BBBY, AMC, BB, Nok, etc.

**PS**. Remember WS is not your friend, but people who trade millions of options and can *consistently* post loss porn for millions of dollars are not your friends either. Don't let them indoctrinate you into holding the bag for likes of Vanguard or BlackRock.

**PPS.** Obviously I fucking like the stock, and don't like broad market, not a financial advise, I don't **know** what's going to happen, etc."|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093312.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'APPL', 'APPL', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'P', 'DOW', 'GME', 'BBBY', 'AMC', 'BB', 'WS', 'PPS', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'DOW', 'GME', 'BBBY', 'AMC']

&#x200B;

üíéüôåüöÄüöÄ\*\*TLDR at the bottom.\*\*üöÄüöÄüíéüôå

&#x200B;

I do not think that you all here realize that we have essentially won yesterday at 9:58 AM and that we almost crashed the entire thing. There was a post here describing a [""30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb""](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

In this post, they described and expressed their outrage with the Interactive Brokers Chairman interview.

# THEY ARE CORRECT!

There was ANOTHER interview with  [Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RS4JIEVyXM&feature=youtu.be) that I did not see that received  as much attention here.

In this interview, it is a bit longer **(** **must watch imo).**

It explains *some* of the ambiguity with the previous interviews with Vlad from Robinhood and what happened in general.

# It confirms that:

1. THEY HAD A LIQUIDITY PROBLEM
2. THE SHORTS  ARE STARTING TO GO BUST
3. THE BROKERS ARE ON THE HOOK TO GET SHARES THAT THEIR CLIENTS CANT GET
4. THE BROKERS THEMSELVES CANNOT COVER THESE POSITIONS PROPERLY
5. THE CLEARING HOUSE ALSO CANNOT COVER AND ARE GETTING LOANS FROM THE BANKS DUE TO THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

&#x200B;

Essentially, we **liked** the stock so much üöÄüöÄüöÄ  that the shorties (all my homies hate melvin capital and shitron) blew up so fast that the BROKERS could not properly margin call them in time.  THEY COULD NOT LIQUIDATE THEM IN TIME TO GET THEM TO COVER THEIR POSITIONS IN TIME.

Now, the brokers are on the hook to go get the shares for you if their clients cannot. THIS is why there is a margin call and margin maintenance to avoid this from happening. But we BLEW past all of this so fast that they are now on the hook since their clients the  **üåàüêª** now cannot get the share that they legally need to provide you.

Since these brokers are large, they usually have the capital to cover these losses and get the shares themselves. As [Thomas Peterffy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM&feature=youtu.be) flexes that he has billions to cover. When I heard it first has made me raise my eyebrows since why would he flex this number and then highlight the 15billion losses. Then it hit me... **THEY CANNOT COVER THESE POSITIONS.** These brokers are starting to not be able to clear these transactions so their clearing house does it for them.

The clearing house in short makes sure that when you sell your share you get your money in your account. They usually have about 1-2% of capital requirements for the stock that is being traded to make sure that they can settle the transaction. HOWEVER, for GME it is raised to a 100%.

**THE CLEARING HOUSE CANNOT SETTLE THESE TRANSACTIONS!**

Once Robinhood's clearinghouse went down the transactions started getting routed through Webull's clearing house ( I belive it is [Apex](https://www.apexclearing.com/) that they use). They almost IMMEDIATELY had to put a halt on it because they could not settle the transactions.

THEY STARTED TAKING LOANS FROM BANKS TO KEEP THEMSELVES FROM HALTING THE **ENTIRE** STOCK MARKET.

# THE ENTIRE STOCK MARKET WAS ABOUT TO COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEY WERE ABOUT TO NOT BE ABLE TO SETTLE THE TRANSACTIONS!

# THERE IS NOT ENOUGH STOCK TO GO AROUND!

At this point, what that all means is that THERE IS not enough stock to go around and the LOSES of these  **üåàüêª** are so **LARGE** that the brokers cannot get the shares that they are legally bound to do. And their CLEARING HOUSE cannot do it either.

THIS IS WHY THEY STOPPED YOU FROM BUYING BUT ALLOWED SELLING.

They used the short ladder attack and essentially in a low volume caused the price to drop by trading in between themselves to a point where they were sort of able to cover some losses. **BUT,**

IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS SHORT LADDER ATTACK,

The most beautiful thing happened...

# EVERYONE HELD:

(From [Luis Rossmann's Video (6:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enLiJfijWBI) )

[Bid vs Ask price difference is massive!](https://preview.redd.it/oaf0eab8m8e61.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb0bc1d6774794c8641d9e9aec287e42fc19e2f0)

Look at that difference between BID and ASK.

I love ALL of you.

You all  üíéüôå  that shit so hard!

&#x200B;

You , yes **YOU** reading this , because **you** üíéüôå that shit the price did not drop further. Because of every single one of you, they were not able to cover their positions.

&#x200B;

What this all means is that we are close to winning and we will not only take out the greedy **üåàüêª hedge fund üåàüêª** managers but also THE BROKERS, THE CLEARING HOUSES and the WHOLE THING.

&#x200B;

Now, this all means that we are very, very VERY close to winning. At this point, IF we manage to get all these options to exercise in the money today, it will be 15million -20 million shares that will have to be bought up by the market makers ( this is the gamma squeeze that is probably going to happen today and would then cause **the SQUEEZE** to the moon üöÄ)

&#x200B;

At this point,  I plan to hold and you should too.

If we keep drying out these clearing houses, brokers like fidelity do not have clearing houses and there you should be able to buy freely. The more we clear them out the more they will have to cover and we have a chance for a real financial revolution.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR:

The brokers have let their **üåàüêª  clientsüåàüêª** lose so much money so fast that they were not able to margin call them in time and now they are on the hook to provide the shares.

The losses are so large that THEY the BROKER are not able to provide the share and then the clearing house has to do it.

THE CLEARING HOUSE CANNOT PROVIDE THE SHARES because of the capital requirements for GME and they are borrowing from the banks.

This is creating a liquidity problem that can affect the entire market. Buy them out and then buy on brokers like Fidelity that do not have a clearing house.

This is why they stopped allowing GME to be bought but you could still sell it because they wanted to save their own asses.

Everyone here managed to üíéüôå  so hard that caused the price to stop falling and the BID/ASK price to increase drastically.

I am buying and holding.

üöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄüöÄ üöÄGME to the moon üöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄüöÄ üöÄ

I have 15 shares @ $40.44 (not much I know but I am gonna reload asap) and I am planning to sell 10%-20% at $10k and hold to sell the rest of my position at $42,069.69/share

&#x200B;

EDIT:

I should have made it more clear, for people that are asking about what to do if they do the same halt on buys, use brokers that do not rely on clearing house like Fidelity

We know the media, the banks, the platforms, and the hedge funds have been trying to scare us to bail on GME. It‚Äôs not so inconceivable that they‚Äôre trying to do the opposite, too: titillate us into thinking that the price will go higher and higher and higher. 

I may have autism but I‚Äôm not retarded. Do you really think seeing GME at $1,000 will inevitably mean it will go to $2,000 or $5,000 or $6,900? Who controls the game? Hint: IT IS NOT YOU.

I‚Äôm just begging you all to take SOME profit when we hit $1,000, but don‚Äôt sit there getting greedy thinking ‚Äúwell if it hit $1,000 it can hit $2,000 which means I can afford TWO orders of tendies!‚Äù Some of the numbers I see here are absurd. $30,000 ‚Äî for real? Citadel and all those fucks probably went long yesterday, or are otherwise trying to figure out how to. As soon as this bitch gets them comfortably in the black they will bail. Meanwhile they hope a handful of retail clutches on the rocket to the sun, forgetting that mother fucking Icarus died trying to get there.

Before you shout ‚ÄúBUT DFV IS HOLDING‚Äù‚Äîour lord and savior done sold and took some profits. Check his post history. He‚Äôs set. We are not. If he‚Äôs not selling it‚Äôs for funsies at this point.

tl;dr Take profits‚ÄîGOOD profits, not this $420 shit‚Äîand let the rest ride. Don‚Äôt get greedy. Pigs get slaughtered. Protect yourself.

That is not entirely true. 

RH is allowing anyone with ZERO shares of GME to buy up to 5.  Anyone with currently less than 5 shares can buy more up to a total portfolio of 5 shares.  Anyone with more than 5 shares can not purchase shares. 

This is important because these fuck clowns know that those of us carrying greater numbers of stock likely have the capacity to buy greater numbers of GME shares and reduce liquidity. 

They are simultaneously:
1)  manipulating the system
2) taking advantage of people with less funds
3) preventing a greater number of shares from being purchased

They did this so they could have a talking point in the media and during their congressional investigations and say ‚ÄúWe reopened stock purchase of GME‚Äù and nobody will dig deeper. 

This is fucking dirty ass pool and fucking outright manipulation. 

Here‚Äôs the video proof:  https://imgur.com/a/AV3IGMa

Edit: and yes.  I do have other brokerage accounts and those are working fine. Shout out to my homies at SoFi, Fidelity, and Vanguard. I have GME stashed in those accounts too.

Edit 2: I‚Äôm not giving a pass to those fucks at other brokers too. Thomas ‚ÄúThe Shit Engine‚Äù Fluffer at IBKR can eat a bag of fucking rotten cocks too.  Saying GME is worth $17 and the stock should be restricted until it drops to $17 because it‚Äôs overvalued.  Fuck you Fluffer. You know what‚Äôs overvalued at $17? Your shitty blowjobs. You give really shitty head you old lemon party fuck. ^no ^homo

Edit 3: RH has now dropped the shares you can buy to 2 shares. If you hold more than 2 shares you can not buy shares.  Go use another broker.  Fuck IBKR, Fuck RH and fuck the hedge funds and brokers.  They are gaming this entire thing.  Go ahead share this post with anyone not on reddit.  Everyone needs to know they are being bent over and violated without lube.  Market got caught doing retarded shit (shorting over 200% of GME) and now we all are suddenly the retards.  GO GET FUCKED Vlad the Cock Impaler and Thomas Fluffer and all of you fuck clowns.

Edit 4: Dear SEC - When GME was trading and trending above $350 is when RH and others dropped the share buy limit to 2 shares.  This is coordinated and planned manipulation.  $350 matters because if GME continues to trade consistently above $350 then gamma squeeze occurs for todays closing options.  This is coordinated and premeditated manipulation.

Here‚Äôs the proof of the new 2 share limit: https://i.imgur.com/RhwgoRu.jpg

#Edit 5: I made a comment that RH was stealing a share from my account.  We all have moments of retardation.  Some of us, like me, dwell in the retard.  I was wrong and I appreciate other redditors pointing out my mistake.  I've delete the comments and posts I made elsewhere.  RH has done enough shit wrong but disinformation, unintentional or not, is not what we are about.  I apologize for the honest mistake.  But fuck RH, IBKR, and the hedge funds anyway.  Nothing changes.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 3 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Tues or Wed next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 120% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

This is an unprecedented moment in Financial history. The establishment is balls deep in each others' arses and we saw that in the Citadel-Robinhood-Point72-StevenCohen collusion yesterday.

For those who missed what happened: Robinhood and other brokerage platforms coordinated a short attack on the retail investor by blocking buy orders and allowing only sell orders. This resulted in a near evaporation of buying volume and panic selling from a lot of understandably concerned stock holders.

It can be construed that this was happening on the orders of the great Citadel, who may have profited off opening short positions at the top. This was seen and caught by multiple order flow traders who noticed block trades. 

*A short ladder*

A short ladder was initiated. They closed the gates to retail and then block sold orders in the open market to drive down the prices. They did this between hedge funds A, B and C to maintain positions while profiting off their short positions (initiated at ATH). This can also be cross checked by looking at yesterday's volume, which was truly minimal. These HFs engineered the short ladder to use the low price to cover their short positions for cheap. Yet, the short interest dipped only marginally (from 140 percent to 120 percent) 

The idea was to have retail offload as many shares as possible to increase float, which will make covering the short positions easy. So now we know that this is what they want. They want us to sell. And they will try a variety of tricks to make us sell. The short ladder was one of those. 

So what can we do? And how will it matter? 

We do the opposite of what they want us to. We don't sell. How will this help the short squeeze? 

Not selling (and letting the buyers pile in) will add to the buying pressure. It will also reduce float. 

So when the shorts do choose to cover, they will need to buy again, and again, and again to cover their entire position.

So hear me out here let's do some quick math. Short interest (no of shares shorted/ no of available in float) = 120 percent. There are more shares shorted than exist to be bought. 

Investors like Burry and Cohen further reduce this float by piling in. In reality, the short is a good multiple of the float (this is my hunch). We have caught them by the balls and have a chance of changing the status quo. 

All you have to do is Hold and not increase the share float. Shorting Gamestop is becoming more expensive by the minute. The shorters need to pay their brokers margin to borrow shares too. By reducing float, we can make these HFs bleed more. 

By holding the line, we make HFs taste blood.

Bail out both sides by liquidating the hedge funds, but not the brokers or clearinghouses, but also put a buy order in for $10k per share to allow GME shareholders to exit.  Isn‚Äôt $700 billion better than a financial meltdown?  Just like last time you can ‚Äòput rules in place to make sure this won‚Äôt happen again‚Äô

In 2008 the banks held risky assets and got bailed out because they said the innocent normal people would be hurt even more if you didn‚Äôt bail them out, so the government did it.  

We posed a risk to the liquidity of the hedge funds, brokers, and clearinghouses yesterday.  By bankrupting them it would probably cause a temporary stock market crash as they liquidate their positions.  

Are we not now in the same position as the banks were in 2008?  Buy us out of our positions for $700 billion to save the rest of the market and the normal people right?

Edit because it got attention:  if this ever was a reality it would in the form of a loan to clearinghouses and brokers to cover any losses up to $10k per share.  They would have to pay it back over time.  The government would get the money back and reimburse taxpayers, while at the same time collecting taxes from the gains of the retail investors. Long term the clearinghouses and brokers recover, the market continues to function,  and then they never let hedge funds put on a risky play like that ever again. The hedge funds involved are deservedly bankrupt, and the retail traders get the reward they deserve by playing the free market game by the rules."|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093217.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['GME']|['GME']

Kevin O'Leary (Shark Tank's ""Mr. Wonderful""):  


""The definition of the market is speculation when you buy and stay long in a stock you are speculating about the profits you hope appear and you take that risk""  


""The best thing we could do for this market right now is leave it alone and just shine the light of transparency on it. if you are short, let it be transparent and you now run the new risk that these effective social media vigilantes are going to come after you and squeeze you in your short. And that's going to make a lot of hedge funds think a second time before they try and go short in a stock which I think it is great.""   


Paraphrase: We have 100s of millions of people who have nothing set aside for their retirement. And along comes a platform that has millions of investors....And yes, they will lose money as every investor does. Just shine transparency on it.  

And, finally, he made the argument that CNBC ignores, that GME now has a new lease on life:   


""How do you know that Gamestop executives are not going to take advantage of this situation and make a pivot just like Netflix did when they were shipping out CDS in the mail?"" 

Anchor breaks in to say they need to protect ""the little guy"" from the ""big guy"" (which is a joke since they only care about the ""big guy."") 

""The only person I care about are the people who lost their jobs. . . I really don't care if a few hedge funds go to zero. Who cares?""  


Anchor: what about the kids who take the stimulus checks and put it on margin and could go to bankruptcy:   


""They didn't learn investing in high school so let them learn in the real world."" 

I got so sick of CNBC yesterday that I ponied up for extra $14 a month for a cable package including Bloomberg and it is so much more balanced and nuanced plus you get a lot more news of world markets and commodities.

I know words are hard for you retards so maybe numbers will help.

GoPro‚Äôs revenue is expected to be \~$1B for ‚Äô20 (slight decline admittedly but that‚Äôs due to COVID) which means their market cap is currently only 1.4x their revenues. That is dirt cheap.

I don‚Äôt think PE is appropriate for this stock so let‚Äôs look at FCF. As mentioned in my original post \[Link\], GoPro is expected to generate \~$100M of revenue from the subscriptions @ 50% margin is $50M. That along with its camera sales should get it around \~$100M of FCF. This means the company is only trading around 14x FCF!!!

Taking a look at just one competitor (Garmin: GRMN) they are trading at 40x FCF. Not a clean competitor but a competitor still.

They also rolled their debt at a lower interest rate. If the outlook for the company truly got worse, despite decreasing rates, the debt price would not have really changed. They‚Äôre turning a corner.

Don‚Äôt sleep on this one.

TLDR: GoPro makes cameras and generates cash üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ üöÄ

Not only, they also put the wrong birthday. So every time I tried to setup a brokerage account, it said I was entering the wrong credentials. 

I called Fidelity and they told me I was going to have to submit a paper application to correct the incorrect birthday. I said I'll do that, but I'll probably try to find someone else, because I'm trying to get my assets out of my Robin Hood account. He asked to put me on hold to see if there was something he could do in the back office. He put me on with someone with the 401k department (he stayed on the line while I talked to her). In the end, she told me I was going to have to do a paper application too. He thanked her for her help and told me to stay on the line so he could see if he could try something else. Best fucking customer service. He helped walk me through creating an account, changed my birthday, and walked me through get a transfer set up for my assets at Robin Hood.  The customer service is such a refresher from the nightmare we've had to deal with with Robin Hood.

I love capitalism. The power of competition. Fuck Robin Hood.

They are literally PRAYING for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. They are HOPING that they can make back their money at our expense... **BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THEY HOLD THEIR SHORT POSITIONS IS COSTING THEM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY!!!**

I remember when the housing collapse sent a torpedo through my family. My father's concrete company collapsed almost overnight. My father lost his home. My uncle lost his home. I remember my brother helping my father count pocket change on our kitchen table. That was all the money he had left in the world. While this was happening in my home, I saw hedge funders literally drinking champagne as they looked down on the Occupy Wall Street protestors. I will never forget that.

My Father never recovered from that blow. He fell deeper and deeper into alcoholism and exists now as a shell of his former self, waiting for death.

 This is all the money I have and I'd rather lose it all than give them what they need to destroy me. Taking money from me won't hurt me, because i don't value it at all. I'll burn it all down just to spite them.

This is for you, Dad.

This is false. You are buying and selling from real people or algorithms that believe they can scalp your order. The idealized scenario is that GME rallies, Melvin covers, and everyone at reddit gets out at the top. This represents a misunderstanding of market mechanics. Melvin will cover before we truly know it, and the crash will happen as quick as the rally.

So with recent events, you must ask yourself:

# Who is Your Counterparty?

Nothing is a sure bet. How confident are you that your counterparty is who you think it is? Thousands of redditors & new traders beyond have been buying stocks fully confident that Melvin Capital hasn't  exited their trade. This is also supported by some analysis provided by two different firms, although their estimates differ some amount. Confounded in this is the interpretation of the data: Does this include market makers and dealers that are short stock but covered with calls or options deltas? Is their information fully accurate in an event the likes of which has never happened? It's tough to know for sure. 

# Know Everyone's Hand

Your guess on *how much they've covered* and *when they covered* has a massive effect on how you perceive the value of this trade. Buying if you think Melvin has $10b notional to cover is a much better bet than if they only have $2b to cover. You also have to consider how much notional the rest of the market has bought in anticipation of a squeeze. The difference between the two represents your effective edge.

Remember, we don't *actually* know Melvin's current position. We don't know what's going on behind closed doors. We only know the hand they're showing us via media. Has their clearing firm taken over? Has a much bigger collection of firms absorbed the position? Have they been buying since Monday? Have they covered and have new funds entered the space at a much better level? 

You are fighting Goliath at a poker table in the city of Gath. The pot is worth $25 billion dollars. Ken Griffin has *never* lost. Melvin's prime brokers Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche are not used to losing (well, Deutsche is). They will do whatever it takes to take the pot *from you* and leave you holding the bag. They will not blink twice because there is a *lot* of *fucking money* on the line.

# Know What Can Go Wrong

Nobody could have guessed everything that happened this week. Prepare yourself for the unexpected. Your brokerage will undoubtedly close out your position at the worst possible time. The stock could be halted for days. You could be assigned on ITM options. Your stock could get delisted. Your stock may get diluted.

# Only Spend What You're Willing to Lose

This one is self explanatory. Your investment could go to zero. Even if you think you make money on every trade, if your bet size is 100%, the long term value of your portfolio is **zero*****.***

# Don't Take Out Loans on Emotional Capital

If you are new, you really don't know the gut-wrenching, stomach-turning feeling of seeing the possibility of your net liquidity hitting zero or negative. It fucking sucks. You just know the highs. You're buying along the speculative frenzy and frantic rallies, wrapped in anti-billionaire & pro-underdog themes. It may even feel good to think that a guy who cut his teeth at a firm notorious for an insider trading scandal is getting his comeuppance. We love the feeling. **If you are fully invested financially & emotionally, you are completely overleveraged and will pay the price.** Make feeling good your goal, and set limits that you can stomach. 

There are several feel-good stories of people making life-changing money to pay off their student loans or their family members' surgeries. Please think twice about this, and only spend what you can afford to lose. If placing a bet makes the difference between your pet living or dying, you may have a gambling problem. These were success stories because they got in at a much better level and could have had a much sadder ending.

Secondly, don't take it personal. There are people on the other side of your trades, your brokerage support line, the subreddit, the media. They are all playing their own hand to the best of their knowledge. It's easy to blame a broker, yell at their support desk, hate-tweet at a company, or even rage-text that guy you know who develops APIs at ETrade. A lot of people across the industry are *rooting* for you. Fuck, even Ted Cruz and AOC are *rooting* for you, because this transcends politics. If you're mad at Melvin Capital or Ken Griffin or the guys who crashed the economy in 2008, keep it that way. They will try and misdirect your anger in every single direction: brokerages, the media, and reddit. If your enemies are a few guys at the top holding a $25b short position and moving levers, keep it that way. 

Thirdly, if you don't want to be a human being for the sake of the person on the other side, be a human being for your wallet's sake. You make better financial decisions in the absence of emotions."|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093224.csv|StockTicker|['A']|[]|['GME', 'ITM', 'A', 'AOC']|['GME']

1-Even though buying seems to be back, it can change again in any moment and your orders may not fill. When the dip comes again, AND IT WILL, DO NOT SELL. You may think you can sell all your positions and buy back in on the cheap, BUT THERES NO GUARANTEE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BUY BACK IN. JUST HOLD AND WE WIN. DONT BELIEVE ANY SHORT FLOAT LIES TODAY.

2-Our buying preassure is low today thanks to rh fucking us, and mainly because most of us are already holding. At this point its a game of waiting them out and NOT pussying out in their attacks.

3-Melvin fucked up with this whole situation, but these guys are NOT stupid. They have harvard mathmaticians and professional risk analysts. They probably figured out that their losses will be marginally LESS for holding their positions open and paying the borrowing fees than it would be if they covered now. They want to wear us down over time by blocking us from buying, sniping stop losses with ladders and constant media attacks like that sellout Cramer saying the squeeze is over. ALL we have to do is hold, and we will win. If you keep selling, they can slowly cover over time while keeping the price steady.

I want to preface this by saying that this is not financial advice and this is purely for entertainment and informational purposes only. I have no position on Gamestop stock at the moment and no position on the other very volatile stocks either.

I realize that this is a long post that very few people will read so **if you don't want to read all this, at least read the next paragraph :**

TL;DR : *Gamestop is very risky and most probably much riskier than you can imagine as the stock price can go back to 10 or 20 in just a day or 2. The price does not reflect the fundamentals and if suddendly people realize that they can't sell the stock at a higher price as they hope they could, nothing will justify those high prices and the stock price will collapse very quickly. (See Wirecard chart to see what I'm talking about). A lot of you accept those risks the same way a lot of you accepted the risks of investing in bit###n or any scam related to it : you're ok with it only because it's going up and will cry about it as soon as it's going down. And for the novices here, I don't think you fully grasp how insane this is right now as you have no frame of references : you see stocks skyrocketting and think that this pretty rare and I'm here to tell you that it's never happened since the dot-com bubble and i don't know if you remember but this shit didn't end well (even for good tech companies).*

Another thing : English is not my native language so sometimes I'm going to express myself poorly and I apologize for it.

Now, I want to debunk a few things about Gamestop and Melvin Capital :


# 1. They will have to buy at $10 000 no matter what.

False. If they have the choice between waiting (and paying interest for borrowing the stock) even for years they'll do it as it's much MUCH cheaper than buying back the stock at $10 000 or any price above $400 (that I chose completely arbitrarely). As this is (in some way) unprecedented, they will have more help from banks and other hedge funds to help them keep their positions longer until this whole situation calms itself down to prevent them from selling at a completely absurd price.

# 2. They will go bankrupt as a result of this.

Nope. They got bailed out by some hedge funds and they will get bailed out by others in the future.

To prove my point, I'm going to take the case of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM for short) that was in a similar situation :

- At first, they had a good strategy : they had a bunch of arbitrage that nobody really thought of and they got really great returns (they averaged 40% annually).

- Then, other hedge funds copied their strategy and the opportunities got smaller and smaller, so LTCM decided to put riskier and riskier bets. Those bets were very big positions on very illiquid markets therefore if the trade were going badly, they were losing a lot of money and to add insult to injury, since it's in illiquid markets, they would have a very hard time to get out of their positions.

- One day, a bunch of those highly leveraged positions were going down big time and LTCM could not handle it. They sold a bunch of them at highly unfavorable prices but they couldn't liquidate their positions completely.

- Then, banks, hedge funds and the fucking federal reserve decided to bail them out to prevent a major financial crisis. They gave them billions of dollars, split their positions and therefore the losses as well.

- The hedge fund did not go bankrupt and it stayed alive for a while but then they stopped completely as their creditors got paid back.

If I'm telling you that long ass story, it's because it's really similar to what's happening with Melvin Capital : 

- They had a good strategy at first : shorting companies that are slowly going out of business.
- Then got into riskier and riskier plays : added more into their plays in hope to manipulate the price forcing the companies that they shorted to go bankrupt.
- One play went badly.
- Now they're being bailed out by a few banks and this is going to happen even more until this situation stops.

Now there are a 2 differences here :

- First, the positions that LTCM had had no chance of recovering and the price was going to be like that if not lower for a long time. In the case of Melvin, the price of GME will not stay at $10 000 and probably not even $500 for very long.
- And second, this is a much smaller position compared to what LTCM had back then. They had $4.6 billions of dollars in losses on highly leveraged plays, Melvin Capital doesn't have that much even with a $1000 stock price.

So what will happen in my opinion?

Melvin Capital will keep their positions as long as they have to. If the price doesn't go down, the government will probably force some stock holders or the company itself to sell the stock at a reasonable price to help them out.

# 3. This is like the 2008 crisis.

Like wtf??! 

This is nowhere near like the 08 crisis. Like what are you smoking??!

The CDS (the products that they bought back then) were literally worthless and could NEVER recover. A lot of people defaulted their loan and therefore those loans could NEVER recover. The banks were leveraged 30x meaning that for every million dollars worth of defaulted loans, their losses were at 30 million dollars.

Also, the sums for the 08 crisis was much MUCH bigger than the 10 billion dollars that the company is worth right now.

Also, in the case of the 08 crisis, a lot of those products got exchanged around the world and made it a worldwide crisis.

Finally, if you think this is like that, then remember that the government bailed them out with the taxpayer's money and a lot of banks and hedge funds actually MADE MONEY from this crisis. And some banks sold those worthless products to some of their clients that lost all of their 401K.

# 4. They will have to buy it back from us.

False, I've already debunked this : they will probably ask the company to sell it at a ""fair"" price whatever that means.

But to expand on that, I want to talk about the greater fool theory as this is probably the best example of this right now.

From Investopedia :

>The greater fool theory states that it is possible to make money by buying securities, whether or not they are overvalued, by selling them for a profit at a later date. This is because there will always be someone (i.e. a bigger or greater fool) who is willing to pay a higher price.

This is obviously happening right now as some of you bought the stock at $11 and sold at $20, some bought it at this price and sold it at $100 and so on.. and some of you bought it early and kept it this whole time hoping to sell it at a much higher price. 

This strategy only works if you're able to sell your security at the ""greater fool"" or in other terms, someone that is willing to pay it at a higher price.

Right now it works because everybody is hoping that the hedge funds (and mostly Melvin) will be the greater fools but they have much MUCH more ressources to go through before buying it at these ridiculous prices : manipulating the market to scare the retailers, halting the trading for the stock, preventing the retailers from buying the stock, getting bailed out by other banks, the government or the federal reserve. So i can GUARANTEE you that they will not be buying at those prices.

# 5. Shorting is criminal and should be illegal.

That's going to be short (no pun intended) : No. Shorting is a good strategy when you have a shitty company that will probably go out of business. Tell that to the ones that shorted Enron, Wirecard, or bought all those CDS (essentially shorting the housing market).

What should be prevented is abusing your shorting position to put pressure on a company and forcing them to bankruptcy as they were doing to Gamestop. 

If you shorted Blockbuster, Hertz, Kodak, and many others, it wasn't criminal, it was profiting off of a dying business. If you think this is horrible to do : this is debatable but also you're basically doing the same thing by trying to squeeze them out of their positions.

# 6. The class action lawsuit will result in Robinhood going out of business.
Robinhood will say that they halted buying the stock to protect their clients as this is a very volatile stock and they were not professionals. Also, they were issues with the clearing of the trades making it impossible for them to execute all those trades without impacting the trading of the rest of the securities.

Also, in the Customer Agreement, section 5-J :
> I understand that Robinhood may discontinue My Account and any services related to My Account
immediately by providing written notice to Me.

Also, they could just lie and make bullshit claims and will get away with this because their clearing house is fucking Citadel and Citadel is pretty fucking powerful in the financial system.

# 6-bis : People leaving Robinhood will result in Robinood going out of business.
Most people will not leave Robinhood. 

There were countless examples of pretty fucked up things that they've done and people still use it to this day. Quote from a comment that I've made a few days ago :

> After GUH moment, countless outages during very volatile moments, them using fucking Citadel (you know, the ones that gave money to Melvin to let them live a bit longer) to clear your trades, them not giving you the correct bid/ask data, the app being full of bugs, and them having a better mobile app than website, and [people] still use it??!

If after all this and way more, people still use it, people will still use it even after that because it's fun to play around in their app and now those retail traders are used to the app.

# 7. This is unprecedented, so nobody can really predict what will happen.
False, a lot of those things happened before, so this situation is not precedented but the MAGNITUDE of the situation is. You could definitely predict them preventing people from buying as they're scummy af, you could predict banks to bail them out (and even more in a few days) as this has happened before with LTCM. You can predict that they will not suffer the consequences because in all scandals they never fucking do as they're so important to our system and them going out of business will collapse the whole financial system. 

So here are the things that can happen :

- Gamestop is forced to sell their stock at a ""fair"" price. If they refuse, the government will threaten them with legal consequences like market manipulation or some bullshit like that (don't need to be right, just need to scare them with big consequences).
- Hedge funds will give their positions to banks and banks will sell them to customers (just like in the 08 crisis).
- They will be bailed out to prevent a big financial meltdown. Then, as people will realize that they will never close their position at the high price that they hoped they would, they suddendly sell their shares and the price of the stock will collapse. The hedge funds buy back the stock at a low price. They make money in the process and a lot of retails lose their life savings.

In fine, my point is that if you want to hurt them, you're hurting them a lot right now with your newfound power. But don't think for a second that this will result in them going bankrupt or any big consequences for them. This will result, as always, with them making a lot of money (or at the very least recouping their losses) and the retail investors losing all their money.

Why This Weekend Is So Crucial...

Ok listen up retards... I know it's Friday and some of you short-term monkey brains are thinking about bailing on your brothers. Your paper hands are beginning to cramp up. I get it. **BUT WE CANNOT SELL!**  


There are still **MASSIVE** amounts of shorts on $GME. Still well over 113% of total shares floated (*from S3 Partners*). Some old shorts have gotten out, but many **NEW** shorts have taken their place in the past couple of days hoping that $GME will die out.  


# Here is the key part...

They are literally PRAYING for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. They are HOPING that they can make back their money at our expense... **BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THEY HOLD THEIR SHORT POSITIONS IS COSTING THEM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY!!!**  


# BILLIONS A DAY.

All we need to do is **HOLD**. That's it. We will cost them so much money today, next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and on and on. Soon enough they won't be able to pay the cost of their shorts or it just won't be worth the cost anymore and they will all eventually have to bail. **THAT IS GOING TO BE THE SQUEEZE**. Once the costs keep adding up, they will start to bail and the rest will follow.  


WE MUST STAY STRONG. DON‚ÄôT FORGET WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US. IT'S A GAME OF CHICKEN. WHOEVER BLINKS FIRST.. LOSES.  
We're not fucking blinking.  


**TL/DR: HOLD. HOLD. HOLD. THIS WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK IS CRUCIAL!**

Think about it: the hedge funds have to go long at some point in time to cover. All we have to do is wait and let them kill themselves in the process.

This is general advice I don't see in WSB.

Fellow WSBers,

I felt the need to write this to the collective group. Many of you have added a zero or more to your overall NET WORTH in the last couple months, weeks or days. Congratulations, that is awesome. I am truly happy for you and wanted to offer some advice.

&#x200B;

* **Take a Break.** Revel in the win. You need some time to reset on your new situation.
* **Do something nice for your immediate circle** \- significant other, family, close friends, a stranger.
* **Don't tell everyone how well you did.** You can say in general but keep it vague. Your money is your money, no one needs to know. There are people in this world that will take advantage.
* **Leave 50% of the big win in cash** for at least a couple days, a weekend, a week to reformulate your move forward. Pushing it back into the game immediately is a great way to lose it all.
* **Don't forgot what got you here.** Some of it was luck, some skill, some determination. Accurately assess your ability. May be time to join Theta Gang with some of it and buy 100 block chunks of stock and sell some Covered Calls or sell Cash Secured Puts.
* **Start thinking about Retirement.** If you are young, start a ROTH IRA and fully fund it for 2020 and 2021. BIG BONUS - You can trade this money without worrying about taxes until you pull it out when you retire.
* **Pay off some debt** \-  Be smart actually transfer some to your bank account and pay off a credit card, student loan (leave $10k or less in cause Biden comes through), your car (maybe, most interest rates are 3.5% or so). I would probably not pay off a house cause you need dry powder for future plays but it does bring piece of mind.
* **Tax Man cometh and he will take away, prepare for it**. You will pay short term taxes (same as your income tax rate). Some of you will bump up a couple tax brackets this year and for the first time in your life have a significant tax bill. SET ASIDE 25% or more for taxes. If you held for over a year it is capital gains at 15%. If you traded in retirement accounts, congrats you trimmed years off your retirement age. It may be worth the money to actually talk to an accountant or tax professional. You may want to pay someone to do your taxes in 2020/2021.
* **DO NOT MAKE ANY BIG PURCHASES** for a time period. You will make poor decisions in the moment. Why do you think the casinos have expensive malls right next to them. Easiest way for them to get their money back is when you drop it on something that is over priced.
* **Review your budget**, or create one if you don't have one. Don't start spending above what your current salary/income stream is.
* **DO NOT QUIT YOUR JOB.** Don't assume you can get similar results moving forward.  Don't become a day trader. The market has been crazy since last Feb/March and frankly for the last 10+ years. It can and may slow down.

These are the thoughts of a dad and exactly what I would tell my sons.

Saw this too - [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/gamestop-short-sellers-are-still-not-surrendering-despite-nearly-20-billion-in-losses-this-year.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/gamestop-short-sellers-are-still-not-surrendering-despite-nearly-20-billion-in-losses-this-year.html).

These are expiring options, highlighted in blue are ITM. All of these will be exercised today and shares sold to the contract holders. the 320 strike has a lot of volume, but there is even more volume at 200 and below. Hell, even closing above 115 is millions of shares that get exercised. Shorts need this to close below 60 to even have a chance, if we close above 200 we are crushing it. Don't believe people saying we need to keep this above 320, they are just trying to get you to sell!

Be on guard for them to try to flash crash GME at 3:59.

I recently read, that RH was restricting sales to 1 share and the UK broker turning off buys. This seems to a tactic to silo off buys.

RH will likely turn off all buys soon.

I'm concerned that they may plan to flash crash it at 3:59pm. If you've considered buying in, consider buying /setting a limit order at **3:45pm EST**

So if you don't have a RH account, put in a limit order at 3:45pm to buy 1 or more share at a price you're comfortable with, if you want. This will provide a huge bid wall in front of the them, in case the pummel the order flow with low asks.

**Edit: From Note1, I would argue that it would be better to set a limit order around 3:45pm in case they try to do a halt. see Note.**

**If this was informative. Tell 2 friends and tell them to tell 2 friends. pass it on.**

Note:

""Just wanted to add to your post that **like yesterday they may try the flash crash 5 min before end. The volatility halt will kick in, (as it did yesterday at 15:59:41), so we had no chance of getting it up in those last 19 seconds.** If they are hovering 10%+ above 115, 150, 200 with ten min to go, we know that will be their plan - **and 15:50-15:54 will be crucial to get out of the 10% trap""**

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here‚Äôs a trick that will work.

1) Go to next nearest option expiration (Feb 5 as of today).
2) Scroll all the way down the call list.
3) Buy GME call option with the lowest +x.xx% (0% would be no premium at mark).
4) Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let‚Äôs get them!!!

P.S. ~~If you can afford 100 shares but can‚Äôt afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.~~

_Update:_ A screenshot has made it to me that Robinhood is blocking same day exercise so you would need to carry into the next trading day to exercise.

_This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY. You can lose 100% of anything you invest._

EDIT:

1) This works for pretty much any stock.

2) There‚Äôs a catch. You need enough money (please don‚Äôt use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.

Example:

- $GME is $300
- The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000
- Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000).
- Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)

After exercising you could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder."|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093217.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'P', 'S', 'A', 'NOT', 'ONLY', '$GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

For some reason the media has been presenting this like we are 'targeting' wall street on some sort of holier than thou crusade reversal of fortune thing. Guess what. We aren't. We would also be more than happy to take jobs at any fund you can name. We just like the stock. Our goals around here include buying blow and hookers. Maybe the occasional boat or private jet. Think the wolf of wall street, those are our aspirations.

**If retail had shorted 220% of GME's float we would be squeezing them just as hard**

Sure, its funny to take down some stuck up fund managers, but thats a side bonus. We make fun of Citron because Andrew Left got his wife stolen by a green energy billionaire, we make fun of Melvin cuz they tried to short a meme stock.

We have shorted plenty of stocks. Nobody cares. Last year we all made a killing riding the markets down while the normies lost their jobs and lived off stimmy checks. We ride the trends in whichever direction they point. The markets are a zero sum game. Welcome to the club.

But anyways, we owe you a thank you I suppose. Without you getting super jazzed for the 'revolution' we would have never had the capital to squeeze like we did. You may hate millionaires but you certainly made a ton of new ones this week.

With the lack of shenanigans today I predict an extended-hours ladder attack is incoming when many retail traders are sidelined from the action, combined with another media push of scare tactics incoming this weekend. We were caught off guard with the RH bullshit but hopefully enough people can get set up with Fidelity next week to even the playing field. But above all else: fuckin hold and we're golden

I've commented before about what trash this company is, and what trash their fucking app. is.

This is the equivalent of telling you that now you're only allowed to sell, not buy, because Citadel got on the wrong side of these trades when you made them.

Robinhood does not send your trades to the exchange.  They send them directly to Citadel or one of three or four other market makers.  You're betting directly against Robinhood when you use it.  They clear their own trades.

It's a total sham, and they are exactly the antithesis of what they bill themselves as.  They are designed for these big money players to make money, and for you to lose.

Get a fucking Fidelity account.  They send your trade to the exchange, and pay for that.  They don't get paid for order flow.  They're not on the other side of your trade, so they have *no incentive* to tell you that you can't buy something, *because they need you to sell it to them, instead*."|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093249.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|[]|[]

If you note, there were insane volumes during closing, but price remained steady. Because when the hedgecunts where manipulating it to go down and crash, several people found out the technique to buy excercisable calls with almost no premium.

We bypassed the ban on buying more shares and were able to keep the momentum going above 320.

We won the battle, and are well on our way to win the war. Since it closed above 320, millions of calls will be exercised and the gamma squeeze has officially begun. All we have to do now is HOLD. Just chill during this weekend for we have a war to win next week.

I don't know if the technique will work on Monday, and if it does, anyone looking to buy 100 shares or more can do it. Remember to remove stop losses, and set limit higher than 1,000$

In the past week, subscribers have quadrupled, pageviews have surpassed 1 BILLION, and the potential financial gains are unlimited!

We wanted to take a moment and teach all the newcomers what wallstreetbets is all about.

Wallstreetbets is a place of high risk, high reward, trades. Some are well thought out... but not usually.

#**We've got [losses](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair%3ALoss&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=top&t=all)!**

There was the guy who [bought gourd futures and lost everything](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzoh1c/i_am_financially_ruined_agricultural_futures/), the guy who [turned a $5,000 investment into a $58,000 loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/aeqcvt/i_dont_know_when_to_stop/), the guy who [put everything on the Argentinian peso, hours before it collapsed](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cpcao5/the_guy_that_called_argentina_to_tank_was_right/eworkdq/), the guy who [had to take physical delivery of oil](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5e3e5/i_bought_oil_at_32_yesterday_and_made_26000_sort/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=wallstreetbets&utm_content=t1_glamjdk) and [""GUH"" which is a video you just need to watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/).

Like resident GameStop multimillionaires u/deepfuckingvalue, we had the guy [who accidentally made $110K](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7w6cq0/i_somehow_made_110k_this_morning_and_im_still_not?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=wallstreetbets&utm_content=t1_glamo3x), there's the guy who [shorted the powerball lottery](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3zvxp5/shorting_powerball_update/) You can check out some more of [those gains here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair%3AGain&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=top&t=all).

#**We've got general craziness!**

Like when [we found the ""infinite money cheat code"" on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drt5tr/guh_of_fame_2019/), forcing [Robinhood to post to WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4r0sy/robinhood_statement_on_options_collateral_and/) and push an update disabling options, we had [the CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, Martin Shkreli](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3q38qg/iama_martin_shkreli_ceo_of_turing_pharmaceuticals/), regularly posting, livestreaming, and even becoming a moderator. We've got [Mr. Beast investing $100,000 in whatever the top comment said to invest in](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hrorfa/i_will_invest_100000_into_whatever_is_the_top/). We've got [Pokimane, asking what to invest in and becoming a moderator](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f75eod/thank_you_for_giving_me_moderator/) and subsequently crashing the market in March. We have people who lost bets and had to [drink their pee](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gak2gf/i_said_if_spy_closed_green_today_i_would_drink_my/) and [tattoo our logo on their butt](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/io8i5z/im_back_bitches/) (NSFW).

So if you have an insane trade idea, **post it here**! We look forward to roasting you like we did u/deepfuckingvalue when he posted about GameStop in 2019. He's worth 8 (9?) figures now, so who knows, maybe you'll be next?

What you won't find here are political discussions, self-promotion, and other nastiness is not related to our single and most important goal: making money. 

For those new to the subreddit, you'll notice that we use [some ""colorful"" language](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7fr21/basic_guide_to_wallstreetbets_culture_for). Rest assured, we mean you no harm. It might take a while to get used to how we talk, but you'll quickly find that this subreddit is surprisingly kind.

#**And we've got you!**

The community here is incredible. Each and every one of you make this place great and better than it was the day before. 

For those who have been around for a while, please reach out and help the newcomers. For those who are new, please don't hesitate to ask questions and get involved. 

From the bottom of my heart, thank you for being here.

I see a lot of people shitting on AMC for being framed a ""scape-goat"" for GME shorts to divert us from GME.

There is no doubt that short squeeze is apparent in GME but let me explain why AMC shorts can also get FUCKED by recent events.

&#x200B;

# 1. AMC Has a High Short Interest % [https://www.highshortinterest.com/](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)

AMC is #2 on the list with a whopping 78.97% of float being shorted. and looking at the % held by institutions( 37.24% ) and assuming that these institutions are long on the stock, we're looking a short to float percentage of about **116.21%.**

Yes it's still lower than GME's 200 something % but 116% is still very, VERY high.

If this is not enough to cause a short squeeze I don't know what will.

# 2. AMC Got 2 Big Unexpected News.

Just like how Ryan Cohen's involvement has started this crazy investing phenomena, AMC has also receive a bunch of unexpected news that caught the ears of boomer investors.

Recently it has received a lot of funding to not go bankrupt and even wiped off their debt by diluting shares. This was a great move as many investors will be looking forward to hop in for brighter prospect of the company. Plus with the vaccines being released AMC will get back on their feet in no time. Also, since they recently raised money by diluting shares and wiping away their debt, there won't be more share dilution in the near future.

Lastly, with the whole GME scandal, it received soooo much coverage on media and the public  which is only going to hurt the shorts.

# 3. New Shorts are In The House

If you look at [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/amc](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/amc) and [https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc](https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc) The shares available to short has gone down significantly. JUST 4 days ago the short availability was at **7 million** and now this morning it went all the way down to **500**(0 on fintel).

This means a lot of shorts possibly jumped in due to the recent jump in the stock price. However, what they don't realize is that this is an unprecedented time where millions of retailers are buying the stock to HOLD...because they like the stock. Not to bring down corrupt hedge fund fuckers of course.

# 4. GME Steam Has Cooled Off a Bit

I know I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this last point but, personally, I think GME has potentially gone up to a point where retailers are not hopping in as much because of the high stock price but the ones who already got in are holding/adding to force the shorts to cover. This could explain why it really hasn't moved all that much in the past 2 days(except when it went down to like $132) despite people saying there will be a gamma squeeze today.

AMC is sitting at $13.00 as of now and it is at a relatively more ""desirable"" price for normal people to hop in. Psychologically it FEELS better to hold 30 stocks than 1 stock.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm not suggesting you should sell GME and buy AMC but I can see about 5x return on AMC and about 3x return on GME in the near future. and I like to make more money so my money goes to AMC. I can write about how I got those 3x and 5x but that's for next time.

Articles have started to trickle down on Reddit and other social media platforms trying to explain how this is a bad idea and justify the actions of Robinhood and other brokerage firms. The apologist is coming out in force trying to put out the flames and cool everyone off because it‚Äôs the weekend. 

Don‚Äôt allow yourselves to be fooled. You are all now an alchemist. You turn shit üí© stocks into gold üí∞. In the following days, the most likely thing that will occur is that these billionaires will go to great lengths to continue to justify their actions and reinforce their legal and financial defenses. They will go out of their way to demoralize investors and try to make paper hands üôåüèª out of üíé üôåüèª winners. 

Don‚Äôt be fooled, don‚Äôt be detoured, don‚Äôt be discouraged. Your greatest assets are your cumulative purchasing power and the rage that drives you to continue holding and purchasing despite all the rationalizing that is going on in an attempt to stifle your capital growth üöÄüåï

I have been in the fucking game for about seven years now. 

I don‚Äôt typically do posts like this and so this is fucking new to me. Anyways, it seems like a shit ton of you are falling out of favor with NOK. I don‚Äôt know what the fuck is wrong with you if you expected to gain a shit ton of money in a day, but what the fuck I have never seen such üßªü§≤üèª in my fucking life for the past two days. 

Are you guys really just going to stand there and let the enemy beat the fuck out of us. 

And of course some of you are going to mention the total float as if that fucking matters because the stock is still cheap as fuck (for now lol üöÄ) and because we managed to trade one fucking fifth of all the NOK stocks in circulation. They literally had to stop our asses from buying a couple of times. Just like you autistic retards I have lost thousands of dollars in this shit. My paychecks, birthday money, dividends, money from the sale of blue chips and Ark ETFs, etc.

So where‚Äôs the upside? Well let me fucking tell you where the upside is and when you can expect to pull off the biggest fucking heist alongside GME and AMC Wall Street will have ever seen. üî•üöÄüí∏

NOK is well known to be the bigger beast when it comes to the BANG stocks (BB, AMC, NOK, GME). It has a fuck load of shares to go around and there‚Äôs a lot of paperhanded pussies out there, so I understand why it may be daunting to expect a Juggernaut like NOK to moon anytime soon. 

But it doesn‚Äôt have to be. 

NOK releases its earnings on Thursday and its expected to blow the competition out of the fucking water. I wouldn‚Äôt even be surprised at all if it were to get a higher price than ERIC in two weeks (hell, possibly by EOW). NOK even plans to merge with top tier companies in the near future due to their prowess in the 5G tech that they‚Äôre developing. The üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêª have had their big meaty claws ever since its ATH of $62 all those years ago. Do you really expect a change if you don‚Äôt fucking BUY and fucking HOLD. No, with a team of fucking retarded  superstars in this sub, NOK is prepping for a fierce comeback in the upcoming weeks. GME is top dog right now, but let‚Äôs be honest. GME hype can‚Äôt last forever (even tho it can for a long time as long as we remain retarded). However being on team NOK makes me feel like I‚Äôm on a loosing, shitty ass baseball team and no one is hitting over .100

What‚Äôs the plan, Stan?

The fucking plan is that you don‚Äôt buy market price. You look at the ask price and you fucking buy it. This is how we destroy walls. The $5 barrier battle today was hard fought and we fucking lost to the hedge funds. This next week is going to be fucking spectacular ü™ÑüöÄü§≤üèªüíé and I need to know if my fucking NOKle heads are even in it to win it or just downright frauds. 

You say NOK was a plan by the bots? Take a look at fucking BlackBerry. That shit took the same swerves NOK did that it‚Äôs pretty much identical. If NOK is a sham, then the idea of the BANG stocks is a sham. 

I know for a fucking fact you don‚Äôt believe that. I know that there‚Äôs dreamers in this sub. I dream just like you. I am trying to build a life just like you guys are. We are in something way bigger than ourselves so if you can for ONCE IN YOUR LIFE consider that maybe that the process is a trustable process then maybe we can win this shit.

If NOK hits $50, I will literally buy new fucking silverware (like expensive handmade shit with sterling silver cutlery) and eat my own shit. I don‚Äôt give a fuck whether you‚Äôd want to see it or not, because honestly boys I‚Äôd eat my shit to go to the moon and I am 200% willing to take one for the team. 

This year, BANG is for real.

So hedgefunds, keep your ears out for the NOK NOK sounds on the door. We‚Äôre pissed and we‚Äôre armed to the teeth.

EDIT: General cheese reporting. Post this shit everywhere. I dont give a fuck. I WILL be producing a flank strategy tomorrow. People have to know goddamn it. Monday/Tuesday will close at $7 just give it time

The bell doesn‚Äôt fucking ring until WSB says it fucking rings. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄü•µü•µ

EDIT 2: some of you pussies are asking where you can buy NOK. The easiest way to buy it is with that fucking app all the whores on Tinder beg for food money on: Cashapp. There are literally no fucking limits and if you want an extra 2 fucking shares then use this shit when you sign the fuck up and get $10 extra buckaroos: BKXDNGQ. I also want to make it clear that everyone should share their cash apps so that we can get that $10 extra to put into NOK. I‚Äôm only doing this for the small wagecucks so if you have the money to do so, then don‚Äôt bother. This is just the only thing on the top of my head that would help out in any way

Diamond hands means diamond hands, you hold, i know greed is a big factor and you want more money but if we want the price to skyrocket (potentially going up to 10k, very possible based on 2008 shorts squeeze) we have to hold.

Shorty is a politically connected trust fund asshole who got into Harvard/Yale on legacy. You never worked a day in your life, but your congressman/hedgefund daddy gets you a job at Citadel because your daddy is friends with the head muckity muck and then you go on to start a long/short hedge fund that invests in fruits. 

You want to buy a shiny apple at $120 thinking it will be $130, but you don't want to just buy a shiny apple with your own money - you want to buy the apple with someone else's money, so you borrow 3 oranges from some reddit retard who thinks you have his best interest at heart. You immediately sell the 3 oranges at $40 a piece to buy a shiny apple at $120. You do this because you think the apple is worth more and will appreciate more, but, you turn into a greedy asshole. You then go on TV and tell everyone that oranges are cancerous to scare people into getting rid of their oranges and bring the price down to $20 so that you only have to pay the reddit retard half of what you sold the oranges for. 

This works for a while. More greedy rich assholes follow your lead and sell to each other to the point where 40 retards sell their 40 oranges to these assholes, who sell to each other, making the total number of oranges borrowed outstanding now 70.

This is ok, as long as the orange is worth less than the apple. You sold 3 oranges at $40 and bought a shiny apple and now the apple is worth 130 and the oranges are worth $20, so you made more than the $10 that increased in the value of the apple (130-20*3=70). 

However, something bad happens - Reddit retards notice not enough oranges exists to cover what you and your friends owe, so they decide to buy up all the oranges to raise the price of oranges. Unfortunately for you, this works. And now, oranges are worth $195... So what is your account worth? Negative.

How? You still owe 3 oranges, just they're now worth $195, and all you have is 1 shiny apple worth $130 to show for it. Your net position on this trade is now worth ($130-$585 = -$455)... Did I forget, that you are also paying 28% interest on the $455, only increasing the amount you owe day after day? You sweat, you panic, you tell your friend at CNBC to tell everyone everything is ok and that you closed your position when you know - you literally can't as you cry and shit yourself and avoid being seen in public as much as you can and keep ignoring you prime brokers phone calls asking for more margin, hoping Robinhood will save you, but they don't, and those oranges are now worth $325 each and its only the first week...

Hundreds of thousands have joined in and rallied alongside us while others have scolded us for being reckless and harmful and stating that we should be investigated or sued. 

Either way, I think it's fair to say that this has been a once in a lifetime scenario and a lot of us have come upon some money that we didn't expect to have. 

In the spirit of being the smooth brains we are, we still have a lot of work to üíéü§≤ until Melvin's wife's boyfriend can't buy the prada bag he wants. But, once the shorts fully cover  and the tendies are secured I think it's only right for us to give back a little because we know how good it feels when the tendies are spread around.

So, I propose that, when the dust settles, the mods set up a way for us to all donate money as a group to some charities or efforts of our choice (maybe we can vote and split funds by percentage). Together we can show that we're not the greedy fucks that we're taking this money from and can raise a lot of money for great causes and I think that's a pretty good way to start off 2021.

If so, then that shit's fucked and fuck them.

These last two days we‚Äôve seen insane backlash against RH, and, on the surface, for seemingly good reason: they restricted our ability to purchase GME among other shares, at a very important time! THEY SUPPRESSED RETAIL DEMAND DURING A SHORT SQUEEZE.

But I don‚Äôt think this was a decision they willingly made, nor do I think they made it in defense of the shorters (although it did inadvertently help them).

I‚Äôve read a few things, and correct me if I‚Äôm mistaken about any of them, that point to the clearing houses being responsible for RH‚Äôs inability to allow its customers to trade. The most recent evidence showcasing over 50+ shares that they‚Äôre restricting trading on, clearly indicates RH is experiencing a liquidity crisis. Why? Clearing houses increased RH‚Äôs margin requirements while conducting trades in their behalf. Not just RH‚Äôs, but many other brokers as well. 

When a trade is made, the clearing house is the intermediary. Let say you want to buy 1k of GME. RH takes your order, and gives it to the clearing house (it goes through citadel too but let‚Äôs ignore that for a moment) and the house finds a seller. They match you together, and the clearing house buys (with their own money) the share you want, gives it to you, and gets your money, but not right away. It typically processes for something around 2 days. They provide temporary liquidity to guarantee sellers get their funds immediately, and they require RH to also put up a portion of that temporary liquidity, as collateral (margin).

So what happened? The margin RH was required to put up increased from anywhere from 30% to 100%. That means if you buy 1k of shares, RH used to only need to show 300. Now they have to show 1k. And if they don‚Äôt, I assume they end up out of compliance, which leaves them liable to a lot of bad shit.

What happens if RH doesn‚Äôt have the liquidity to show 100% margin? They can‚Äôt take your trade, because they‚Äôd be out of compliance! So they reduce the amount of shares customers can buy to remain within liquidity margins. Same for other brokers as well. It seems really bad with RH however, because now they‚Äôve increased their reduced stock list to companies like Starbucks and GM. Wild. And with all the public backlash, customers are also probably trying to withdraw funds, causing a liquidity crisis feedback loop.

Now here‚Äôs the part that worries me, and again, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. RH innovated by allowing retail traders to trade for free, without fees. Their competition was forced to capitulate to these new standards. No fees, means easier trades for retail. Primarily, in the past, retail‚Äôs most common trade (and still probably today) were long term holds. If RH goes away, there‚Äôs a chance we see a reiteration of trading fees.

There‚Äôs also a chance we see more option restrictions on retail as well. The squeezes we‚Äôve been seeing happened, in part, because a purchase of an option causes the seller to go out and purchase shares to cover, in case the option is exercised. The relative price of purchasing an otm option is significantly less than of purchasing the underlying stock itself, but if many options are purchased, much of the stock gets purchased, and we see these types of gamma squeezes. RH enabled this. 

Anyways, positions are GME shares and calls, and of course: üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ"|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093313.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'RH', 'RH', 'GME', 'THEY', 'ESSED', 'ETAIL', 'EMAND', 'URING', 'A', 'SHORT', 'UEEZE', 'I', 'I', 'RH', 'GME', 'RH', 'RH', 'RH', 'RH', 'I', 'RH', 'RH', 'GM', 'RH', 'RH', 'RH', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GM', 'GME']

I got out at $60 but my risk tolerance isn‚Äôt super high so I‚Äôm fine with it and enjoying watching all of the gains from the sidelines.

I‚Äôm not trying to rain on the parade but I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about VW, AMC, and GME and their short squeezes. Until this week, and specifically today, I‚Äôve basically been of the mind set that GME is a real squeeze and the others (AMC, etc.) are not. But today I‚Äôve changed my opinion. Please hear me out because I think there is a lot of logic to this.

THE SQUEEZE SQUOZE, NOW IT‚ÄôS SIMPLE SUPPLY DEMAND
Ryan Cohen and GME ruling out bankruptcy are what caused the squeeze. Plain and simple. They created a better outlook and higher genuine value for the company. This gave us a little squeeze forcing shorts to move from their ~140% to ~120% short interest today.

Now that that squeeze occurred and they had to deal with raised price targets, we are simply dealing with very low supply. Shorters are not buying to cover really and lots of retards are buying creating upward movement a momentum. Not much supply. So right now there is no squeeze going on and we are all very dependent on stock lenders margin calling the shorts.


THIS ISN‚ÄôT VW
Just wanted to add a short section here since this event does seem to be the inspiration we all draw from. In this case the shorts did get fucked and got margin called. The lenders did this because there was genuine concern that they would not get there stock back since there is 13x more shorted than there was available. If you buy that 1% and give it back to a lender you have 12% more to go, then you have to buy that 1% from that lender you just got it from, but what if they won‚Äôt sell? There was genuine concern from lenders they would never get their shares back. Total loss.


THESE SHORTS WONT BE MARGIN CALLED ANY TIME SOON
As it currently stands the shorts are paying 30% APR on tens of billions of dollars to the lenders with VERY LITTLE risk in the long term that they will not be able to get the shares back as EVERYBODY (even is, mind you) expects the shares to go back down a lot after this is said and done.

So from a lender‚Äôs perspective, would you rather call your shares back and end the party with huge yearly returns? Or would you rather drag this on for as long as possible and collect fees from shorts? The shorts will happily do it because they don‚Äôt want to lose their shirt, they would rather pay the premium. And even if they did call their shares back, the market would explode and crash before they even had them settled.

Really in the end, we are giving Melvin and the other shorts more time to adjust their position to a more favorable one before it comes back down. So in the end, unlike your believe that bears are fuk, it is retail investors that may be fuk.


CAN GME SQUEEZE HARDER?
I would say probably not soon. It could go higher if people keep buying and holding, but again, in the end retail might end up paying.

The one opportunity I do see would be a share vote or something else that could cause shares to be recalled. But that is unlikely and might not even happen at the yearly investor meeting.


HOW TO MAKE MONEY ON THIS
Honestly without lucky timing retail investors may be fucked here. Premiums on puts make it practically impossible to profit.

WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER SQUEEZES?
Similarly to the current state of GME, we are driving price up and giving shorts better entry and lenders fat APR.

TL;DR: this may be the best trick Wall-street ever played on us. Play acting that they are losing money and Robinhood is their martyr.

Edit: Thanks for commenting everybody. After this interaction I think the squeeze could work out, but it would take insane diamond hands and/or some strong buy pressure. Time and high borrow rates need to ware them down to be sure that this squeeze happens."|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093317.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'VW', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'I', 'THE', 'UEEZE', 'QUOZE', 'NOW', 'S', 'IMPLE', 'UPPLY', 'EMAND', 'GME', 'THIS', 'T', 'VW', 'THESE', 'HORTS', 'WONT', 'BE', 'ARGIN', 'ALLED', 'ANY', 'TIME', 'SOON', 'APR', 'VERY', 'ITTLE', 'YBODY', 'CAN', 'GME', 'UEEZE', 'ARDER', 'I', 'I', 'HOW', 'TO', 'MAKE', 'MONEY', 'ON', 'THIS', 'WHAT', 'ABOUT', 'THE', 'OTHER', 'EEZES', 'GME', 'APR', 'I']|['GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when it‚Äôs time to close the positions of shorted shares and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short position will have to close in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  And, who can forget our grandson GME? 

AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when shorts have to close their positions and as a result of that they themselves take the price higher.

More by u/Common-Buy-2379 in comment section:

AMC is also 49.85% owned by a Chinese holding company. This company controls over 75% of voting shares indirectly, through controlling interest in subsidiaries that also own shares.

They will NOT be bailing out the hedge funds, which would dilute their ownership in the company. They will not be floating their shares for sale during the squeeze.

In all likelihood, the upcoming stock issuance will be sold to larger firms with little interest in assisting the hedges, and will probably remain within Chinese control.

Not financial advice, I just read the 10-k, 8-k, and 10-q, because I like this stock. Also tendies. I love tendies.

To illustrate, If the Chinese owned shares aren't available to fill the shorts, then there's only 13M shares to fill the 44M shorts.

It's WAY shorter than people think.

Positions: 

- 1700 AMC shares balls deep @ 18$ average (~30K)
- 6c AMC 19/3 (10 contracts)

Edit: Earlier I had ‚Äúshorts expire‚Äù in this post which seemingly drew some people crazy ignoring other important aspects. I meant to say when shorts will have to cover their positions. Edited in post.

What if GME offered an obscene amount of shares knowing that they wouldn't all be bought and only bought as a worst case scenario for the hedge funds?

What if they did a cap raise of 50 million shares all at a price of lets say $1000?

If hedge funds are forced to cover, that's their out.  Or for fun, we could do it at 2000.  Or, a range of prices.  The first million shares at 1000, the next at 1100, etc.

All current holders, Ryan Cohen, board members, etc would get diluted.  But, they would be getting diluted and the value of their shares would increase due to the raise being higher than the current stock price.

EXAMPLE. 50m shares at 300 are available right now.  They share 50m more at 1000 each.

Each share gets diluted by half, but each of the current shares gain 500 dollars of value.

Essentially, by selling the shares at 1000 each, current share value goes up to $650.

I don't know what I'm talking about, if what I'm suggesting is stupid, say so.  Or, get this to the top of wsb as a worst case trigger to pull.

&#x200B;

Alright, I hate to say it, but there is some less-than-ideal information circulating out there, particularly about the famed ""gamma squeeze"" we hear so much about these days. I'll get to that. Let's go through the questions you simpletons want to know, as explained by a mouth-breathing fool who has managed to convince you he knows what he's talking about:

# Did we win today? Is it endgame?

Kind of. Be patient.

# In what ways did we win?

First, there was the obvious victory of bouncing back 65% today after the worst market manipulation I've ever witnessed. We kept the upward momentum going.

Secondly, every day you finish higher is another day the shorts are underwater. If you are perpetually going up, the walls are closing in on them.

Finally, a lot of put options expired worthless today while a number of call options expired in-the-money. It's always good to make put holders lose money because you drain the bank accounts of people betting against you.

# Yes! Call options! We finished above $320 and get a gamma squeeze to infinity now, right?

No. That's not how this works. Too many people don't quite understand what a gamma squeeze is.

A gamma squeeze happens when call option sellers (or ""writers"") have to hedge their naked calls by buying stocks. They do this because the risk of selling naked calls is theoretically infinite if they don't. It's called delta hedging. You don't need to know all the fancy math (""delta"" and ""gamma"" are those greek symbols for nerds), just understand this: as it becomes more probable that the call option you sold will cost you money, you hedge more.

This is a continuous PROCESS, not a discreet moment in time. The market makers and hedge funds and institutions selling you calls don't wake up on Friday morning and think, ""Shit! I think I'm going to lose everything if these stocks keep going up! I have to BUY NOW!!!"" That would be stupid. They are hedging all the way up. I guarantee you that most of the calls that were exercised at $320 today were already covered. They already went out and bought those shares and most of the upwards pressure that places on the market is priced in already.

# So, no gamma squeeze?

Probably not significantly. They're not going to be madly rushing out on Monday to buy shit they already own for the most part.

# Why are people talking about a gamma squeeze at $320, then?

We did have a gamma squeeze at $320. On Wednesday, two days ago. The price exceeded $320 (then the highest strike price on the books) and promptly surged to $371 before coming back down to around $320. That's what a gamma squeeze is: a frenzied rush by call sellers to cover calls.

It typically happens BEFORE expiration, not after. It's rare for market makers to get so caught with their pants down that they have to get squeezed for the previous week's calls on a Monday. I don't know where this idea of a gamma squeeze now at $320 is coming from.

# This hurts my feelings. So, what's so great about the $320 threshold, anyway? Did it matter at all?

It's still a good thing. There may have been a few lingering naked calls to cover. And, like I said, it's always good to make put-holders lose money because stick it to the üåàüêª, that's why.

$320 was a significant level because there were quite a few open call options at that strike. You can see the entire option chain here: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain)

Go through and count up all the January 29th options that were in-the-money at today's close. I think maybe 90,000 or something? Screw it, I didn't count. Somebody who can figure out how to use a calculator can add those up. Multiply that number by 100 (because option contracts are sold in groups of 100) and that's how many shares need to change hands thanks to contracts expiring ITM.

It may be that with so many shares needing to change hands and so little liquidity in this market, some weird things could happen.

# What weird things?

Well, if nothing else, a lot of shares will need to be tied up as the process of settling calls plays out.

You have to remember that when somebody says they own shares, they don't necessarily *own* own the shares right at that moment.

When you press ""buy"" on your phone and it says your order was filled, that doesn't mean that the process happens instantaneously. For all intents and purposes as far as you are concerned, sure, the process looks instant. However, there's a lot of messy stuff that happens on the back-end of the system between the brokers and the clearing houses. The clearing houses are where the daily tab gets settled: who owes whom and what they owe and at what price, etc.

Monday could be interesting as this tab for millions of stocks (in a market with only 50-something million shares actively circulating) gets settled. It might not be crazy, but it could. We'll see.

Michael Burry (Christian Bale, for all you noobs) seems to think that all the naked short-selling above the float will result in a shit-storm when people actually go to get their shares back: [https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1355221824661983233](https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1355221824661983233)

Liquidity crunch + lots of shares being moved around + nobody knows where they all are currently = potential nightmare for Wall Street.

# I just want my infinite short squeeze and my tendies, so how do we get the MOASS?

Something needs to be the catalyst. Something needs to get the short sellers really underwater, so much so that they are drowning. That's why there's been so much hype about gamma squeezes; the gamma and short squeezes are two separate things, but the gamma squeezing has been really good to us lately. It has triggered some crazy upwards price movements. I still think one was about to happen yesterday morning that would have triggered the squeeze-pocalypse, the Mother of All Short Squeezes. The bastards at the brokerages (acting with and for the clearing houses), took your tendies. It's criminal what played out.

I actually think a gamma squeeze was possible today, as well, as the price shot up to $378 around noon. If it had gotten to $400, it stood a very good chance of running up to $500, which would have caused a run up to $650 and beyond. Then Robinhood said, ""Oh, actually, you plebs cannot buy 5 shares anymore, only 2 now."" The price came back down again.

Oddly enough, the S&P500 sold off over a full percentage point (that's a lot of money) right after GME hit that $378 peak. Do you think this doesn't freak the finance world out? They know a gamma squeeze is like the fuse on a firework. It consumes itself until it ignites the rocket.

# How will Wall Street defend themselves?

They will try to keep snipping the fuse. That's what all these restrictions on brokerages are about. They are trying to defuse the situation slowly because having it all get sorted out quickly and frantically is no good for them.

We need enough upwards price momentum that those option chains keep going up and up and feeding on themselves. They need to become a self-sustaining chain reaction, fed by hedging pressure. And you need to put pressure on your elected representatives to tell them that Wall Street cannot be allowed to just shut down the game when they are losing. I hate to tell you this, but the squeeze has so far been stopped purely by the losers declaring that it will not happen at any cost. It's bullshit. Eat the rich. But there it is.

# Do you feel you've used the word ""squeeze"" too much by now?

Yes. I've been writing and looking at the word ""squeeze"" so much that it is starting to lose its meaning. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeeeeeze.

However, the actual situation between the two companies could not be more different. GME was never really at risk of bankruptcy. GME always had more cash than debt and was paying back debts ahead of schedule, because it has a flexible business model where it can easily close down underperforming stores, which GME did in large numbers this past year. In place of the underperforming stores, GME is expanding furiously into e-commerce. With RC now at the helm strategically, its future is bright.

AMC is in the exact opposite situation. It operates theaters, which it cannot close down without permanent, serious consequences. There is very little room for AMC to cut operating losses during the pandemic. There is no e-commerce pivot. It has theaters, and that's it. For a while now, AMC has been teetering on the edge of a cliff, facing a massive debt load and mounting operating losses, while hedge funds were relentlessly building short interest on its stock like a flock of locusts. AMC had been just a step away from Chapter 11 several times. The shorts almost won.

****This is where we come in.****

The recent rise in AMC's stock price is not just a middle finger to the short interest hedge funds. It is a lifeline to the **real world** operations of AMC. A few days back, one of AMC's debt holders [converted $600 million worth of debt into stock](https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-silver-lake-swaps-debt-for-equity-as-cinema-chains-stock-surged-1234682417/), and there were additional share offerings and other debt conversions.

>It an SEC filing this morning, AMC said it will be issuing around 44.4 million shares of Class A common stock to Silver Lake and related noteholders in the transaction, which will reduce its debt by $600 million.

>Earlier this month, AMC stockholder Mudrick Capital Management also swapped AMC debt for equity, in this case 14 million shares, plus another 8 million as a fee for separate loan.

>As part of its recently announced fundraising, AMC yesterday finished issuing a further $300 million of equity at $4.80 a share.

>It‚Äôs been a wild ride for the nation‚Äôs largest exhibitor but CEO Adam Aron told Deadline Monday that the chain should have cash enough to ride out the year.

Now, a valid concern might be that the additional stock offerings will increase float and ease the pressure on the shorts. But that didn't happen! The good news aspect of these moves significantly outweighs the additional float. With the freedom to raise capital and reduce debt load, the threat of bankruptcy is all but gone. The shorts will not win anymore, it's just a matter of how much they lose. 

This movement is legitimately saving a real American company. This is not patriotic jingoism. AMC, by the nature of its business, employs US residents and supports local economies across the entire country. AMC is a huge corporation but at the same time extremely local and intimate. The vast majority of its screens are in the US, with a solid representation in Europe as well. Yeah, the popcorn is overpriced, but at least it's going into the pockets of US residents and circulating in the local economy. 

And the enemy? Bloodsucking vampire hedge funds who literally produce NOTHING and do NOTHING except amass capital through underhanded and despicable means. 

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to smash those hedge funds and save a beloved company at the same time.

This is not financial advice. I just love the stock, and hate hedge funds."|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093242.csv|StockTicker|['AMC']|['AMC']|['AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'RC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'A', 'SEC', 'AMC', 'A', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'CEO', 'AMC', 'US', 'AMC', 'US', 'US', 'THING', 'THING', 'I']|['AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC']

Price: 140.99  

Average Outstanding shares: 179.69M

Currently owns:

Tinder, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Hinge, PlentyOfFish, Ship, and OurTime totalling over 45 global dating companies.

The growth rate of users on dating apps worldwide has been steadily increasing:

[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/dating-app-market/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/dating-app-market/) 

Of these, Tinder is the most popular by a significant amount; hence, I will use that as my example to illustrate some points going forward:

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/826778/most-popular-dating-apps-by-audience-size-usa/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/826778/most-popular-dating-apps-by-audience-size-usa/)

Tinder growth rate:

[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tinder-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tinder-statistics/)

Facebook growth rate:

[https://www.statista.com/chart/10047/facebooks-monthly-active-users/](https://www.statista.com/chart/10047/facebooks-monthly-active-users/)

The tinder to Facebook comparison is not intended to illustrate that tinder could ever get into the same level of popularity of Facebook; it is much more niche. Rather, the comparison is to illustrate that the growth rates have similarities proportionally.  

Key factor in business model:

Tinder has two primary sources of income. One of which derives from monetization, which has proven to be extremely fruitful for all social media apps thus far.  

Most importantly, they have a subscription based product, Tinder gold for only $15. This has proven to be extremely successful as 6 million of their total 57 million users use it. That‚Äôs 10% of their total users, that specifically chose for the paid model. To put how vast this percentage is into perspective, YouTube has about 2 billion active users, while only 1.5 million are subscribed to YouTube red for $5.  

What makes tinder gold differ from other traditional free app optional subscriptions:

Unlike many subscriptions, tinder gold does not simply remove the ads from the UI. People are paying for two things primarily; they are first paying for the potential to have their profile be seen by others more, since it is extremely competitive. More importantly, they are also able to see the profiles of people who like them. This is a huge factor, because without it, tinder does not allow you to see who likes you. It forces you to continue swiping on random people until you stumble across someone who liked you. Due to basic human nature, people want to immediately see what people liked them, they want to cut to the chase. Therefore, they are required to sign up for tinder gold in order to see them.

Another huge money maker for tinder is the profile boosters. You can pay a certain fee, in exchange for tinder‚Äôs algorithm to push your own profile into more peoples feeds for a finite period of time. This results in significantly more likes and matches. These are not points or games, these are real people, so many often get a rush from this and continue to use more and more boosts after they see how affective it is.  

These being only three sources of their income alone already should illustrate how advanced Tinder is in terms of marketing their products. Tinder preys on basic human nature, and it has resulted in incredible user and financial growth.

Many of these other dating apps that are owned by Match include very similar marketing tactics. Again, I used tinder as an example simply because it is the most popular, and allows me to simplify some of my points regarding these dating apps. It is also the most profitable, due to the impressive marketing tactics I explained

‚ÄúThe company revealed Tinder pulled in $1.2 billion in revenue over 2019, a 43% increase from 2018. Match owns several other high-profile dating platforms including Hinge and OkCupid, but overall revenue for the year was $2.1 billion meaning it gets more than half its revenue from Tinder.‚Äù

Total balance sheet:

Anecdotal notes:

Perhaps some investors will shun me for even considering anecdotal experience to be note worthy, but I do feel that if some individuals have experienced something, it is more than likely to have occurred outside of that individual experience as well:

A large problem with dating apps is that there is a stigma to meeting someone online, or even having the apps downloaded. Several years ago, I remember seeing jokes about people who ‚Äúneeded‚Äù to use tinder to find girlfriends. I even remember seeing memes about people trying to hide the tinder app three layers deep into a hidden folder on their phones. This stigma certainly still exists, but from my experience, it has certainly decreased. It‚Äôs no longer about ‚Äúneeding‚Äù to use the app, it‚Äôs becoming more normalized. The popularity charts I provided illustrate this as well. Many people don‚Äôt even use tinder to meet people; many simply use it to entertain themselves or meet people virtually.

The stigma is dying, and as it continues to die, there will be continuous increases in users. The largest stigma was actually buying the subscription for ‚ÄúTinder gold‚Äù, which gives you a select amount of features. However, even this is becoming more normalized. People can justify it by simply wanting to see who likes them, rather than being for the benefit of helping your own profile be seen. Curiosity didn‚Äôt kill the cat in this case, but it influenced over 6 million users to spend at least $15 a month. 

Entry point?

I figured now would be a good time to make this post since they are coming off a recent sell off. The support has not proven itself yet, so it certainly has more temporary downside potential. Regardless, if you‚Äôre in it for the long run, this won‚Äôt matter as much. Watch for potential support Monday, 

This post will probably be brushed aside due to the short squeeze focus point at the moment, but feel free to share your thoughts if you do end up reading this. I‚Äôm very open minded and completely accept that I can very well be completely wrong on this. I mostly would like to hear people‚Äôs thoughts regarding the key factors of the business model I mentioned. I really do feel that they are next level in terms of preying on human psychology. It‚Äôs extremely impressive marketing in my opinion from a scientific perspective at least.

At some point, Gamestop is likely going to offer stock/rights/whatever to capitalize on their increased value. This is a good thing for the company, and for shareholders. 

For the company, they can make a fairly small offering and gain a ton of money to bankroll future growth or their pivot to e-commerce. For the shareholders, it serves as a floor on the stock price. Consider, if the company offers 35MM shares at $300. That would give them $10.5 billion in their war chest, for 100M shares. This is immediately a bare minimum value of $100/share just in book value. Add in their enterprise value and even the bear case is $150. This would legitimately give them a bull case over $500/share. This would force shorts to cover, while leaving the short percent at ~60%. This would still be a massive squeeze and set up the company for the future.

Alternately, the company could issue a rights offering, which is basically an option to buy. Each shareholder gets 1/2 a right, which can then be traded. If the rights are at $300/share, then they are worth the difference between that and share value. But also, shorts are then short a right as well, incentivizing them to cover, or else they'd have to also cover the right. This acts as a dividend and a share offering. It would *also* raise cash for the company and increase book value, especially if the company finds a broker to guarantee it, saying that they will exorcize any unexorcized rights.

This is one of the benefits of having a high stock price - the ability to raise funds. It's what has allowed tesla to grow as rapidly as it did. And it becomes synergistic. High stock price allows companies to raise money, which in turn helps push their price higher.

Just look at the AMC thread up on the frontpage at the moment. Half the comments are from new accounts with just a handful of karma. AMC is not the next GME. The 'days to cover' on AMC is less than a day. After an initial uptick it will just fizzle out and you'll be left bagholding.

This subreddit has seen a surge of 5,5m people in these last days. That's a lot of people and thats great. But I think theres a few people that don't know a lot about the short squeeze and are here for a quick buck.

if you thought you could profit by the end of this week, this was not the case. The shorts at Wednesday gained an advantage. Imagine if we could stop the market when we had a red day. We would all be billionaires by now. That's what they did. 

I still think the squeeze is still in play though. This means, this will not be as quick and they expect new people to lose interest/panic sell so they can cover lower. It's all or nothing for them. They could pull more insane stuff by next week, you can count that as a possibility. 

That's why its important to understand the play here and not just jump on the hype wagon. You're doing more harm that way. Learn about short squeezes and educate yourself on what has happened till now. 

TLDR: I believe the squeeze is still on. But due to Thursday, it may have gone back a week or so. Due to a surge in people here, they may expected a squeeze to occur on friday. And I could imagine that hedge funds bet on new people losing interest. That's why its important to educate yourselves, To make your own opinion about the stock.

We're based in Europe and as far as I can tell, there are only american Silver futures available (CMEgroup). I don't have experience in trading futures.

So here are some open questions regarding this:

Can we as europeans trade CME silver futures and can we let them deliver to a warehouse in our Country? If yes, what about shipment costs?

reference: [https://www.cmegroup.com/confluence/display/EPICSANDBOX/Silver](https://www.cmegroup.com/confluence/display/EPICSANDBOX/Silver)

There it's mentioned that March is an active future month. What does that mean? Physical delivery can only take place in march?

Additionally, fellow europeans - any idea about upcoming taxes for the physical delivery? We have to pay VAT for buying silver here as far as I know.

So - do you think the physical delivery is even possible? Also to Europe?

let's do this!

e/ I'm already long slv/pslv and silver options. And with slv I mean a european a fully backed european version ""Xtrackers Physical Silver ETC""

e2/ why did I even ask in here! Does anybody even read the text? I know it requires an attention spawn of more than 20 seconds, but come on...

e3/ Some of you didn't fully comprehend, that it's all about getting silver physically. As far as I know, the Papermarket is 250 times bigger than the physical market. A Shortage in the physical market will potentially cause moon prices.  Just read the DDs on silver from the last days:

I eventually created a reddit account but even then took a while to actually join the sub rather than just lurk.  So I was here for a good number of the ""fun"" moments of the last few years.  The box spreads that ""literally can't go tits up"".  Everyone piling on puts on snapchat.  Good 'ol Su Bae.  The great paper trading competition of 2019.  The ousting of ""he who shall not be named"" (the automod removed my post for mentioning his name).  Etcetera, etcetera...   But this will be my first post.

Over the last week and especially the last 24 hours, I've seen a LOT of comments in the pinned threads lamenting the fact that WSB is forever changed and that it's time for another paper trading competition.  I want to speak to that for a moment and if the mods would be so kind as to keep this post up I'd be very grateful.

First of all, yes, WSB has changed, but that's a *good thing.*  You know who else doesn't want change?  The hedge funds, and Wall Street.  The whole point of this thing that is happening IS CHANGE.  The fact that the world is standing to attention right now says something about this is real and that is much more important than being able to remove some noobs because their IQ is too high.

Even worse than the comments calling for noobs to be eliminated, I've seen many commenters dissing people who can only afford small amounts of shares or even fractional shares.  So now WSB is elitist and you have to be wealthy to join and have fun in the markets?  NO!  That's the entire point of this place and GME and this week is that the market SHOULD NOT BE FOR THE ELITE ONLY.

**Have 5mil and want to invest?  Great!  Have $5 and want to invest.  Great!**

WSB endlessly attacks CNBC, etc for not being able to see that GME is NOT about WSB or the fundamentals of these companies, or about making money.  But it's about something much bigger.  And those people who are crying out for all the noobs here to be banned are no better than the entrenched elite like Stephen Weiss who yesterday called this whole thing a ""load of crap"".

We all saw the open letter pinned earlier this week and the responses to it.  We all lived through last year.  And for the first time in a VERY long time, I feel like the world is coming together to unite rather than to divide and it feels f'ing GOOD.

Let the moment stand for a bit.  I promise you that eventually people will forget about this and we will all start attacking each other again and most of the noobs on WSB will never set foot in this place again.

But for now, for today, for this weekend, and maybe a while more, let's be excellent to one another and not decide the worth of someone over how long they've had a reddit account or how much money is in their bank account.

So to all the noobs:

Welcome!  Hope you enjoy your stay.  It gets a little weird around here, so it would save you a lot of time if you just gave up and went mad now.

Due to your actions last week you forced many of us to make a decision of what platforms we will be using to trade from in the future. I personally moved all of my funds from RH to another platform. What you may not realize is that there are a LOT of people who did this as well. All of my funds will become available to trade with on Monday morning as I'm sure many other peoples will be too. 

You fucked yourself and your friends... as come Monday morning will be a whole lot more capital ready to be reivested in GME, AMC, NOK, BB and what ever the fuck other stocks I LIKE.

I LIKE THIS STOCK, I LIKE THIS COMPANY, I LOVE RYAN COHEN and FUCKING LOVE MY FELLOW RETARDS. We are not just lowly elite, we are the SUPER ELITE.

Edit 2: It seems some people are still asking if its too late to buy. I value this stock at $4206.90 and that's what I'm willing to walk away with. I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. With that being said... a life with out taking risks is a life having to wear a condom EVERY FUCKING TIME while you continually pound Melvin's Ass.

Edit 3: Next step.... we reached 320 this week and that was our target. Congrats all my fellow degenerates as we held the line. As you can see they are now offering up to 800 on next week's options. That's our next target. The squeeze could happen or it may not happen next week but we have a target in sight. They are trying to do everything in their power to suppress our valuation. Hold strong autists. We set the price. Prediction: GME opens Monday 500+ and we continue on our mission.

Edit 4: A lot of people are asking me questions about what happened. I was trading GME since Jan 11th as a broke ass bitch, I threw in $200 played a nice $26 call before we spiked to 32 I was excited and cashed out to turn that into 30 shares of GME and hedged my way up to 55 shares over the following weeks. Im not rich, I think I just played this right move.
Now here's what happened on Thursday... The Robinhood app blocked me from buying so my plan was to do a hedge on multiple platforms. Sell half on RH and rebuy after the inevitable ladder attack on my Webull account and then transfer my money there as well from RH. When I sold on RH they literally sold ALL of my shares not just my available shares since the others were locked up in limit sells. I panicked after that happened. And bought in as many as I could on my low funded Webull account. So I had to essentially sit out for the day. Friday full RH transfer hit my account and I set up a new account.
Atleast I sold at around 380 and was able to buy back in below that. I owe about 70k in medical debt and GME gave me a chance at making up some of that, I'm +25k on a $200 investment, I need this. You need this. We all need this.

Edit 5: now I'm hearing a lot about people talking about possibly missing the short squeeze if they transfer. In all honestly do you fucking care at this point? I don't. I'm all in and have literally put every dime I possiy could on GME I don't really give a shit about it. We are making these cunts bleed out. And if something at some point hits my sell limit I'll be happy, but if it doesn't I don't care because I KNOW THAT I DID THE RIGHT THING."|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093249.csv|StockTicker|['NHOOD', 'I']|[]|['I', 'RH', 'LOT', 'GME', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'BB', 'I', 'LIKE', 'I', 'LIKE', 'THIS', 'STOCK', 'I', 'LIKE', 'THIS', 'MPANY', 'I', 'LOVE', 'RYAN', 'COHEN', 'CKING', 'LOVE', 'MY', 'ELLOW', 'TARDS', 'SUPER', 'ELITE', 'APES', 'TRONG', 'ETHER', 'ALL', 'HARES', 'ATTER', 'STONK', 'GME', 'GANG', 'OMEDA', 'I', 'EVERY', 'CKING', 'TIME', 'GME', 'A', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'RH', 'RH', 'I', 'RH', 'ALL', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'RH', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'KNOW', 'THAT', 'I', 'DID', 'THE', 'RIGHT', 'THING']|['GME', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

No, I wasn't paid by Melvin to deter your cause. I'm mostly looking for people to tell me why I'm wrong because all the posts I see are full of shit and are so overly emotional that they seem to lack any kind of logic. Everyone was saying there will be a short ladder attack before close, there wasn't. Everyone was saying there will be a gamma squeeze if we close over 320 and there wasn't. Friday was the first time when I didn't feel I understand what is actually happening - does anybody? Something feels off and we might even have been lead into a trap by Melvin or other hedge funds for them to recoup their losses, So please hear me out first.

(1) Public attention hit its maximum on Friday after being already extremely high on Thursday. It will likely subside rapidly next week especially if we have big dips.

(2) Most calls in the money were probably bought by people who actually don't have the funds to cover them. AH, suddenly 4 million shares were traded (after 40 million) for the whole day, the price dropped rapidly. IMHO what happened is that RH automatically liquidated 40k calls ITM because the holders didn't have enough funds to exercise them (i.e. for a $115 call you need 11500 in your account). This freed up the need to hedge those shares and they were immediately sold.

(3) Calls are now available up to 800 and they're actually not as expensive as you might think, so it's actually possible to hedge shorts quite effectively at this point. If the price doesn't hit $1000 soon, it will be very hard to squeeze. And we need to get there with buying shares only against people who can probably load up on shorts still and without the buying pressure of a squeeze and with considering (1).

(4) Short interest might still be 120%, but these are now people that shorted between 400 and 500 and are already hedged with let's say 600 calls.

(5) A squeeze to infinity would take down brokers and probably the entire market. Do you really believe this is going to happen? Don't be ridiculous. They can change the rules as they please and they did it before.

(6) There are two many players involved now. Before it was an easy story. One hedge fund fucked up their risk management and redditors fuck with them. Now you have people who just FOMOed in and actually have no clue about the underlying squeeze and gamma squeeze theory (because IMHO it actually doesn't work anymore). You have other hedge funds for which I don't know if they're actually going for the squeeze or just trying to get as much money from retailers piling in. What if they loaded up on short all the time around 330, then let the price fall to 250 and buy back in just to give the illusion that retailers still control the situation? To me the price movements look extremely professional, this IMHO is not retail driven anymore. Even if they go for the squeeze. What tells you that they will not be the only one capitalizing on it leaving retailers holding the bag? They know the game 100 times better than any of you and _will_ screw you over.

(7) We actually don't know who is short where and how it's hedged. Simple as that. Before it was Melvin shorted probably around 50 and in deep shit, now who the hell knows. We don't know if they actually covered. There's also dark pools btw. Just because volume was low is not a guarantee this didn't happen.

I thought about this long and hard. Here are IMHO the possible outcomes.

(A) People lose interest next week. The price will fall, people will panic sell. And a lot of you people will lose a lot of money you can't afford to lose. I feel extremely sorry about that because I really liked the movement.

(B) The government will intervene and offer $10k to every GME holder per share to resolve the situation. The money has to be paid by Melvin, regulations will change etc. I think this is highly unlikely as it feels unfair to the people not joining.

(C) The squeeze will go to infinity, each of you will be a billionaire and wallstreet will completely collapse together with the global stock market, because everyone in power who could have easily prevented it by just changing the rules will think it's time for a revolution and it would be unfair towards retailers to intervene. If you believe that, you are seriously retarded, and not in a good way.

(D) The price will keep going up a little bit, but it's not a squeeze. It's orchestrated by hedge funds to make their money back from all the people piling in believing they are still fighting although the battle is already lost. Once they realize, people lose interest the price goes to zero and people will lose everything.

(E) We will have more pressure and there's actually some squeezing going on. It could go to maybe 5000 before the government steps in, halts trading and most likely forces gamestop to dilute shares. Force because Gamestop really enjoys the attention and would draw a lot of hate doing this. But actually getting a lot of free money would probably be more attractive still, so they might do it even without being forced once they can negotiate a good deal with Melvin or whoever is interested to buy the shares at a reasonable price.

Don't get me wrong. I believe in the movement and I'm immensely proud of everyone showing immense solidarity fighting the right fight, just don't be only led by your emotions, also stop to think and add some logic.

I'm still long 100 shares, because I might be wrong, but I just feel after Friday the risk is significantly higher. Please safe, only invest what you're happy to lose (because this is the most likely outcome) and don't forget to try and understand what's actually happening.

Edit: After thinking even longer and harder I now realize that the total amount of shares is super low and that's right there a good *logical* argument why after all this might work. None of you idiots pointed this out to me though. Good luck everyone. I'll hold my remaining shares, now that I have more than just an emotional reason.

Let's call him Melvin. He thinks he's really smart. He finds a coupon for $20 off the new Nintendo Switch during the holidays with no limit on number of units. This is easy. I'll go ahead and sell the Switch now for $200 and then buy it for $180 with the coupon. Easiest $20 I'll ever make. He goes and tells all his parents' friends at the Citadel Country Club that he can get them the new Nintendo Switch for their kids. He collects $200 each from 150 parents. He now has $30K and will use that money to purchase Nintendo Switches for $27K. He'll have earned $3K in just a few hours. His parents will be so proud.

There's another kid watching Melvin this entire time. Let's call him Keith. Keith doesn't like Melvin. Keith is good friends with the guys over at Gamestop. He finds out that there are were only 100 new Switches shipped to the entire country. Keith and his 99 friends buy all 100 Nintendo Switches on the spot.

Later in the day, Melvin goes to Gamestop with his $20 off coupon and says, ""I'll take 150 Nintendo Switches please."" Gamestop guy looks at him and says, ""Sorry, we're all sold out."" Melvin goes to the next Gamestop. Same story. All sold out. He goes to all the Gamestops in the city and can't find a single Switch. He won't be able to fulfill the orders.

Meanwhile, Keith is telling all his friends about what Melvin promised the members at the Country Club. Nobody sell him the Nintendo Switch that you bought, no matter how much he offers you. Nobody likes Melvin, so everybody holds on to their Nintendo Switch.

Melvin is in trouble. His parents rich friends are all asking when they are getting their Nintendo Switch. Melvins parents are angry, but they don't want to lose their standing in the Citadel Country Club. They have to help Melvin gets 150 Nintendo Switches. Now remember there are only 100 Switches in the city, but Melvin has created the expectation among the parents that there are 150. This is how you get a short percentage over 100%. Melvin has promised more than actually exist.

The price of Nintendo Switches in the city skyrockets. Melvins parents were able to get a few units from Keiths friends, but they had to pay really inflated prices for them, first $1,000, then $2,000, now $3,000. It's nearing Christmas, and every rich parent at the Country Club is desperate for the Nintendo Switch they promised their kids. They can't trust that Melvin will be able to get them one. They all start bidding against each other for Switches. Everybody in town is in on the action now. Everybody wants to get a Nintendo Switch to sell at the country club for $10,000. Meanwhile, Keith and his friends are just hanging out and playing Animal Crossing.

\[Edit 1: Thanks for all the love and awards. I'm really grateful. I'll try to answer as many question as I can on the thread and in the DM's\]

\[Edit 2: A few astute monkeys have pointed out some flaws in my story. The example above is an oversimplification and I left a few important elements. So here's an expanded version and I've had to adjust some of the numbers above to make room for new wrinkles.

In a more accurate version, Melvin went to his brother Steve's high school and borrowed 150 Nintendo Switches from the high schoolers. He tells them all that if he doesn't give them back within 24 hours, he will give them each $5 per day. The high schoolers know that it's not likely that Melvin will give it back in 24 hours, so they will be perfectly happy to collect $5 per day. He sells the 150 Switches to the Country Club parents for $200 each, but now he owes 150 Switches to the high schoolers. This is a naked short. He sold Switches that were borrowed but didn't own. Let's assume the Country Club parents wrapped the Switches and they are now under the tree and out of circulation. Although there are 250 Switches in the city, there are now only 100 Switches in circulation (Keith's friends). So you have a situation where Melvin owes 150 Switches to high schoolers and there are only 100 available (150% short position of float). Melvin is overconfident and thinks he will get 150 Switches same day or at the very worse case, the day after, and maybe have to pay 150 Switches x $5 penalty = $450. He'll still have made $3,000-$450 = $2,550. The $5 penalty due to the high schoolers is interest or Melvin's carrying costs, so the longer Melvin cannot get the Switches, the more expensive it's going to be for him. After 4 days, he's at break even and will lose $450 for each day he cannot get a Switch. It gets very expensive for Melvin and his parents very quickly. This is what's happening for the past week or so for GME. The hedge funds are bleeding money every day they cannot fulfill the IOU.

For those who are asking why Melvin doesn't just pay off the high schoolers with money, let's say that the new Zelda game is coming out and they all want to play. They also know that the price of Switches is rising. Even if Melvin offered $800 or $1,000 to cancel the IOU, they know that they can no longer get a Switch on the open market. In addition, the high schoolers are probably aware of the rising trend in Switch prices. They may think that it's better to wait for a Switch that will be worth $15,000 in a few days than to get paid off by Steve now for $1,000. So while it's possible that Melvin could buy his way out of it, it's very difficult.\]"|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093217.csv|StockTicker|['$GME']|['GME']|['K', 'K', 'K', 'I', 'A', 'I', 'GME', 'IOU', 'IOU']|['GME']

There are forces at play here that didn't exist during the VW squeeze. The gamma squeezes and sheer idiocy of option buying by you all has created a perfect storm which is what is created all the trading restrictions. There were going to be gamma squeezes every week until the short squeeze was triggered and no institution has the capital to handle weekly gamma squeezes. I think the restrictions has stopped the infinite gamma squeezes which is probably good for the market because it may have created a collapse and we could never buy chicken tenders again.

So back to timing the MOASS and when to sell.  
1. üíéüëê  
2. I firmly believe you can't time it anymore. The institutions are much more advanced now and the short ladder attacks which we saw multiple times this week and in 2020 creates artificial drops that make it look the bottom is falling out of the squeeze. (i.e., stop loss is bad)  
3. They are obviously willing to lose ridiculous amounts of money borrowing shares because they don't want to ""lose"" to a bunch of internet üêí.   
4. This isn't Porsche owning all the shares. Whatever they say, none of us really know what any of us are going to do. We certainly can't coordinate buying or selling because we would have all bought with DFV. So we may see spikes from a hedge fund covering after short ladder attacks or PM/AH trading. We won't know if any of these spikes are the MOASS.  
5. They made this a war of us vs them. This is personal now for a lot of us and we are willing to hold much longer than any rational person would. Some people will probably hold through the squeeze and fall and witness the rebirth of GME by Ryan Cohen and see the shares go back to $100-$300 on its own. **The original thesis**.  
6. Watch the volume. The short ladder attacks occurred during low volume. Volume will sky rocket during the MOASS and even during the ride back down volume will be high. This is black Friday when the doors open and boomer Karens are climbing on top of each other to buy a tickle me Elmo.  
7. Gamestop step in during the squeeze and announce they are going to bail out the shorters.  
8. They are taking advantage of ladder attacks and trading halts.  
9. Without the gamma pressure from options, we may see the stock price drop significantly after they cover from this past week.  
10. We don't know the price point for the shorters anymore. There could be a significant amount of shorters with price points above $100.  
11. **HOLY SHIT THE PUTS!!!! I just totaled the puts for next week. \~149,000 puts from $0.50 to $100. 8,359 puts from $100 to $320. These are all OTM.** There are a lot of puts that are OTM every week in February.

**My Plan**: I'm exercising all my options (vary between $15-$30 strikes) now because I'm worried about lack of buyers/liquidity and stability of the trading platforms for retail during a MOASS. I'm going to adjust when I sell based on what is going on because there has been too much fuckery. I imagine I will sell a large percentage of my stocks between $1000 and $2000, but we could just as easily see a sudden spike from $900 to $2000 in a 5 minute window and then I probably won't sell till over $5000. If we slowly increase over days and weeks (10%-50%) my tolerance to hold will increase and my sell points will adjust.

We were on the brink of a Bear Stearns moment. Basically, these funds were so leveraged that many of them were blowing up, and it threatened to take down the entire market with it.

&nbsp;


TLDR; Had the ""FREE MARKET"" remained free this would have caused a massive systemic crash due to forced deleveraging of hedge funds.

&nbsp;

**Understanding Leverage:**

Many people don't quite understand the game that goes on between these big funds and the market. These big hedge funds are leveraged up so say Melvin Capital has 12 Billion in AUM (Assets under management) they are likely leveraged up 5-10x meaning they actually own stock positions worth 60-120 Billion. If enough hedge funds blow up at once, the whole system collapses because they are forced to sell longs and deleverage. This is what happened in 2008, and these guys saw it happening again.

&nbsp;

**The entire market was at systemic risk.**


They had no out so they changed the game. The clearing firms, and Depository Trust Company suddenly changed the entire margin requirements for every ""meme"" stock. Basically when you buy a stock normally your broker has to give a clearing firm 2% of the collateral of the stock price, and the trade is matched with a seller/buyer and sent to a firm like DFT who then records you as the new owner of that share of stock.

&nbsp;


**Changing collateral requirements suddenly**


Well guess what they changed the collateral requirement to 100% yes you are correct they changed it to **100%**. This FORCED many brokers to not allow buys on the stock. This is the true culprit behind whats going on. ***The Citadel*** was at risk of blowing up which means big banks like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs were gonna take heavy losses. This would cause a massive market pullback probably between 15-20%. They COULD NOT let this happen. You think President Biden wants to watch the stock market blow up on his second week in office?

&nbsp;

**A coordinated attack on retail investors:**

I have never ever seen the level of manipulation that existed on Thursday and Friday. These funds are all on the brink of collapse so they cut off access to over 95% of the people from buying, and forced sells or hit stop losses on every single open position. Interactive Brokers HAD been my broker for many years, and I had promoted them for ages. Watching their Chairman Thomas Peterffy say we will stop trading UNTIL these stocks return to a reasonable price angered me to my core. You run a broker firm YOU DO NOT DECIDE THE PRICE OF A STOCK PERIOD. This was a coordinated takedown of the young retail investor who was on the verge of a HUGE win.

&nbsp;


**Where stocks would have ended the week causing a market blowup:**

So what is the real price these meme stocks would have ended up at you ask.

$GME 1000


$BB    50


$AMC  30


$NOK  12

If you're already sitting down then stand up, now sit back down. 

First off, *fuck your bitch and the clique you claim*, when I watch a movie I want to see it on a massive 70+ FOOT screen. You think I want to watch a gem like Frozen 2 on small bitch ass 60 inch TV screen with shitty ass TV speakers? No. I WANT THAT FUCKING BASS REVERBERATING THROUGH MY TESTIES AND IT TICKLE MY ANUS. Thats some good shit. I ain't getting this shit at home. My wife doesn't like losers who watch movies on small ass TV screens. That's why she's with her boyfriend right now. 

Secondly, I don't have a fucking fountain soda machine in my house. Im a poor retard who is trying to make a living like Steve Cohen. Nothing is better then sippin' that sweet carbonated nectar with a big fat bin of popcorn or a god damn pretzel. I also don't have an arcade section to kill time. SOME EVEN HAVE BARS. 

Thirdly, this shit is 13$ right now. Severely under valued.    Its not the company's fault that shit stains suppressed this stock for years and prevented further growth. Its not the company's fault that covid fucked its business right in the ass. 

But guess what, we have vaccines now! Covid is far from over but its only a matter of time until our wives respect us by watching üöÄ Man on big ass fucking screens like we ü¶ç are supposed to.

This is a 40$ stock, at the very least and when they're clicking on all cylinders it can go even FURTHER BEYOND. It will take time to get there but this is a no brainer hold!

Position: 1k shares, avg $8.7. 

TLDR: I like this stock. I like watching movies in the theater.

We are entering a new stage of the short squeeze.  It‚Äôs apparent by now that it‚Äôs not playing out like the VW short squeeze because the setup was so long and out in the open.  Hedge funds had time to collude and plan how they‚Äôre going to deal with the fallout.  As we saw last week, they came up with some clever fuckery.

&#x200B;

For a recap, here are some tactics we saw from them:

\-  Short attacks driving the price down, triggering stop loss sells and trading halts.

\-  Spreading the word through the media that they had already closed their short positions

\-  Putting pressure on brokers to limit buying of GME and killing the buy side of the trade, making it easier to drive the price down.

\-  Low volume ladder attacks to drive the price down and forcing out paper hands.

&#x200B;

We held strong, guys and gals.  We closed Friday just a few dollars shy of the highest closing price on Wednesday.  But now the real trench warfare begins.

Melvin told CNBC that they closed out their short positions.  I have a theory that this may not be technically false, with a caveat.  I think it‚Äôs very possible that Hedgies have closed out their ORIGINAL short positions, but they‚Äôve been replaced with new short positions.  These guys are not going to lose billions of dollars lying down, so they must have their own end game for how to get out of the trade alive, and perhaps even make a profit.

If GME was a tasty short target at $15, imagine how irresistible it is at $320.  These fuckers lost their shirts on the original trade, but they see an opportunity to make it back on this new trade by repositioning their old shorts from the $15 to new shorts in the $200-300s.

&#x200B;

How can we know this is likely true?:

\-  The short interest has fluctuated, so we know there has been some covering

\-  The short interest has remained high, somewhere around 100% or above

\-  There have been short attacks in $100s, $200s, and $300s, so we know there are new short positions at those levels.

\-  Hedge funds are cocky assholes and they‚Äôll do anything to turn a losing trade into a winning one, and if it fucks over the little guy to scare them back to submission, all the better.

&#x200B;

So basically, nothing has changed.  This is still a short squeeze play, just with much higher stakes.  We have the advantage however, because it doesn‚Äôt cost us anything to hold onto our shares, whereas it‚Äôs costing Hedgies billions of dollars to hold out.  We will know we are winning next week if we continue to see more de-grossing in the broader market.  If we can hold out, we can take this to the next leg up, ACT III, and eventually the end game.

TLDR:  üíé üôå üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

I had a couple shares back at $20, had paper hands, and sold. I went all in a couple of days ago. Despite it only being a couple of days, I've been lurking here for a bit. The amount of 6 figure, 7 figure, and 8 figure gains I was seeing was blowing my mind. More than that, it was blowing my mind that nobody was selling. I thought, ""you made a 7 figure profit, what more do you want?"" Now that I'm all in, I've been staying more up to date with the things that are happening. And now I get it. I understand why nobody is selling. 

I just saw a video of a billionaire saying it's unfair what's going on. I saw a billionaire say, ""he's just trying to make a living"". I saw an article call WSB an alt-right hate group. I havent seen one billionaire against this movement speak on the recession of 2008. But I have seen stories in WSB of families deteriorating by the days because of the recession. I've seen blatant market manipulation to keep the common man from trading. I've seen countless slanders and whining over the last couple of weeks.

 
You know what else I've seen during this time? I saw a guy on here donate switches to St. Jude. I saw a different guy donate money to St. Jude. I saw a guy pay for his dogs surgery. I saw a dude pay off his student loans. I saw a CEO donate it all to a charity for small businesses. I've seen somebody be able to buy a place after living in their car. 


This is all so much bigger than money. That's cliche as fuck, but God it's true. I'm stuck between my blood boiling and my eyes watering. Honestly, I don't have a huge investment into Gamestop. Its not like my shares alone hold any bearing on Melvin making this out alive or not - but it's all I have. I went from freaking out over losing $100 in a day, to losing thousands in a day and just kinda smirking. 

To be honest, I planned on getting out if it hit $1000. But IM NOT GETTING OUT. Truthfully, I'll survive without this money if it tanks. Obviously money would be nice, but I know some others out there probably need it more. All that I do ask, if you do make it out of this not holding the bag, please do something good with your profits. Please don't turn into the greedy leeches on wall street.

This won't apply to most of you, but it probably applies to *some* of you.

Alright morons, listen up. Law student here who has grown fond of wsb through lurking for quite a while. There are some legal issues you need to be aware of if you are, or have been, making moves with GME/the other meme stocks right now. These issues range from civil to criminal, so you should probably read this. I‚Äôll put a TL;DR at the bottom if words are hard for you.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

First of all, I am *not* an attorney (yet), and you should not rely solely on this post to make any decisions at all. **You should talk to a real lawyer** if you think you might need legal advice. More on that below.

I‚Äôm going to provide some short summaries of cases along with an excerpt from a relevant legal journal that discuss some of the things I‚Äôve seen on wsb as of late, and if it sounds like you, **go talk to a lawyer.**

* ""The opportunity to violate securities laws on the internet is not limited to issuers. Even common stockholders can opt to violate the securities laws by using the internet to manipulate the markets.""¬†Christine Souhrada,¬†Securities Fraud, Market Manipulation, and the Internet, UCLA J.L. & Tech., 2002, at Notes 28

What that means in tendie-speak is that the SEC can come after *you* for some combination of your posts, comments and trades. This doesn‚Äôt mean they *will*, just that they *can.* Note: The SEC has an [Office of Internet Enforcement](http://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/internetenforce.htm). Just because this is [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and the memes are good, you're not immune from real-world problems.

The SEC is not the only source of potential problems. They coordinate with lots of federal and state agencies. I‚Äôm not going to explain the law & procedure of 50 different state law enforcement apparatuses to you, because i'm fond of you, but not *that* fond. Also, like I mentioned above, you can be civilly liable for behavior that doesn't rise to the level of criminal.

The key to what the SEC calls market manipulation is ""causing enough investors to buy the target company's stock by disseminating **false information** to artificially inflate the stock price. *Id.* (See the above-referenced legal journal, that's what '*Id.'* means) This also applies to artificially deflating (by disseminating false information) if you hold a short position or a put, etc; this is the apparent business model of funds like Melvin, and yes, they should be the ones being looked at, but *should* doesn‚Äôt matter and I'm writing this for you, not them.

If you‚Äôve gotten caught up in the hype and memes, and have been disseminating false information in an effort to moon GME, you need to talk to a lawyer **now**. I can‚Äôt tell you if what you‚Äôve said is false or not, but a real lawyer can. The lynchpin of liability (tendie-speak: whether you have a problem on your hands) is the making of material misstatements or omissions to induce investors to purchase securities. See ¬ß17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, and ¬ß10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Here are some examples of people getting in to the crosshairs of the SEC via some of the above-described behavior:

* **S.E.C. v. Simmons**, 8:04-CV-2477-T-17MAP, 2008 WL 7935266 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 25, 2008)

Stock promoter acted with severe recklessness in predicting that a company's stock prices would rise to at least S15.00, yet selling his stock for a third of the price, which satisfied scienter element of the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws. Therefore, promoter engaged in securities fraud. Despite claiming that he posted cautionary warnings to potential investors on his posts on a website and stating that the posts were based on his enthusiasm for the company's future prospects, there was no evidence submitted, besides seller's deposition testimony, that the postings were pre-qualified with a cautionary statement warning potential investors to consider.

* **S.E.C. v. Masri**, 523 F. Supp. 2d 361, 365‚Äì66 (S.D.N.Y. 2007)

Defendants purchased 200,000 TZA shares on August 20, 1999, in order to push the price of TZA above $5, thus causing the TZA August 5 put options to expire worthless and avoid the required purchase of 860,000 shares at $5 per share

SDNY Court held that if an investor conducts an open-market¬†transaction with the intent of artificially affecting the price of the security, and not for any legitimate economic reason, it *can*constitute¬†market manipulation.

    ‚ÄúB-b-b-but I only relied on publicly available information!!11!‚Äù  

* Yeah, well, so did this guy: **Sec. & Exch. Comm'n v. Fiore**, 416 F. Supp. 3d 306 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) Promoter's reliance on corporation's public filings did **not** allow him to get out of the action filed against him by the SEC.

&#x200B;

    ‚ÄúNothing I did moved prices, I‚Äôm too small!‚Äù 

* Still a potential problem. **FindWhat Inv'r Group v. FindWhat.com**, 658 F.3d 1282 (11th Cir. 2011) Finding that confirmatory information that wrongfully prolongs a period during which stock is traded at inflated prices, even without increasing the level of inflation, may be actionable under the¬†securities¬†laws; that is, defendants may be liable for knowingly and intentionally causing a stock price to remain inflated by preventing preexisting inflation from dissipating from the stock price.¬†Securities¬†Exchange Act of 1934, ¬ß 10(b),¬†15 U.S.C.A. ¬ß 78j(b)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Lastly, if, after all of this, you find yourself several orders of magnitude richer than you were at the start: **TELL NO ONE. TALK  TO A TRUSTS AND ESTATES ATTORNEY IMMEDIATELY.** I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware of the issues that lotto winners find themselves dealing with. If you‚Äôve struck gold and are swimming in tendies, you are effectively a lotto winner, which means you are now a target. Even well-meaning people will try to help you spend your tendies. You need to retain counsel to figure out how you‚Äôre going to protect yourself from others.

I'm sorry if it bores you, I saw that story from that dude that posted how his dad lost almost everything during 2008 and I wanted to share my own.


Sorry for my bad English.


Hello WSB, I last post around half a year ago on how the US Stock Market helped me get closer to my dream of being able to support my family with an average country wage of 150USD a month.

I got a ton of encouragement and advices from everyone back then which I immensely appreciated. Now that the GME phenomenon has spreaded over the globe, even here (although we actually cannot help you guys without a lot of trouble like I went through, more below)


So to recap, I saved up 2000 USD ever since I was young uptil now (I'm 21 now), working ever since I was in elementary school, money was all I had in mind ever since our country got hit with the 2008 depression and my family was struggling.


Backstory:


I've always loved PC and paid close attention to it so when their new Ryzen series leaks start getting out in 2016 and I got to test them out while working part time, I took a look at their stock. It was trading at around 2 I think.


So with my excitement I was eager to join the market, I asked my uncle who was a stock investor and his reply was ""The market is rigged, don't join it"". I was stumbed. He lost a lot in 2008, maybe that was why.


So after a month of research, it appears there is no legit way for me to invest in the US market, or actually to any market aside our own. Our banks wouldn't even let us wire money overseas without a reason they deem acceptable. But here's the thing, the hedge funds here can. That was the first unfair thing I witness about limiting the little guy ability to get somewhere in life.


In the end, I couldn't find a way to get in and watched as AMD make it meteoric rise over the past few years. It was really depressing thinking back on how the profit could've helped my family.


Fast forward to 2020, I finally found a way to make a foreign account with TD and have a friend overseas that can help me fund the account, I just need to send him money through epayment. The fees was high, not to mention since we can't use ACH because we're transferring to TD from his account, it cost me somewhere a total of around 50 USD for the money to land in my account.


But after all that I managed to get into the market, I grinded through all the courses on TD and read all the posts from various subs. But life is never that smooth.


Around that time, I saw a post of a member on here using his profit to pay for another fellow member tuition. That inspired me, I wanted to do that so badly, first for my brother.



The Beer Virus Crash:


I joined the market at Feb 28th 2020. Yes, right at the top before we drill straight through earth core because of the beer viruses. I almost lost it all, I switched between puts and calls as I see fit but in the end, I came out with 200USD left. I thought I was the unluckiest guy on earth. It was tiring, since we're on opposite end of the timezone, I usually finish school or work then trare until around 2 or 4am. All that and ending up with huge loss was devastating. Thinking back, I should've pulled out when I was seeing my money losing everyday.


The corona started affecting our country, we did a great job at handling it but I can tell my parents were fearing for their jobs. I put myself back together and get back in with my 200, slowly grinding up back to 2000. It was arduous but when I finally got back to breakeven, it felt amazing. Because I'm not starting again, I'm starting again with experience.


Sadly, by this time, my father lost his job due to corporate politics/dirty-play. I won't get into details but basically there was some bad people doing bad things to try to frame others, it's been going on for years. In the end, he was proven innocent but the corporate still let him go to ""keep the image of the company"". And guess what, he never get a job anymore no matter how many times he gets to those final interviews. We both know that it was because they made him as scapegoat and whenever a new company contact his old one, they would he put off. To them, it's much better to scapegoat one person than to say ""We let a guy sabotaging our employees and company for years without being able to do anything"".


After all the failed job opportunity he decided to give the stock market a try. It was going well. We don't have advance options and we also don't allow ""legal"" shorting here. But as we'll soon find out, it's only a rule for us commoners..


Basically, shorting is not a thing here but hedgefunds or sharks can always call each other and borrow shares to short. I've witness quite a few short ladder attack. 


And since we don't have options, we don't have the ability to buy puts to hedge our account but I am sure the big guy has their ways of getting them


You can tell by this point I have a lot of bottled up contempt for suits.


GME and the global movement:


And that brings us to this unprecedented time. I didn't get into GME soon enough (4 GME shares at 150 cost basis) my money was tired up in Spreade for BB and Nok expiring last Friday which was rather deep ITM (I had BB 21/22C and BB hit a peak of 28 last week). And as we all know, by abusing their power yet again, they tanked the price and those trades are now worthless. But I held GME, I held through their attacks when it tankee to 100 because you guys were holding with me.


So now all I have is 4 GME shares that I will hold until we can get back at them and WHEN, not if, we win, hopefully it will help me somewhat in investing in this market - that hopefully will be a lot more fair after all of this.


A lot of people I know are asking to join and I've been helping them setting up accounts on TDA or eToro. Etoro is faster to get started but they kinda suck. Since there are no way for us to get Fractional Shares (eToro been wonky), some of my friends are putting money together to hold one shares of GME on Monday.


I look forward to the day we win this, so many things are on the line, not just for our generation, but our previous and future generations, not just for the US stock market but for all market as well as everything unfairness in the world. In the end, we might win the battle of GME but still not win much from this war of unfairness but that's a start.


So to conclude this stupid long TEDtalk. You have reinforcement from everywhere WSB. Even from places that cost 2 months wages for a share.


Let's make them pay for what they took from us and my brother tuition also! 10k per share is not a meme!!!


TLDR: Poor kid from 3rd world country holding GME because suits treated his family badly.

Position: Every penny in my name - 4 shares of GME

BUY AND HOLD GME!!! - This is not financial advices.

TLDR: We are this way, because it's the only way we are allowed to be, as retail traders.

Now that that's out of the way, lets look at it from a normie traders point of view.

&#x200B;

1. **Pattern Day Trading:** Why does it exist? To protect us? From what? Do you ask for a W2 for everyone literally walking into a casino to see if they are capable of losing what they are risking? No, they are free to spend as they please. Funny, I thought that's what a free market was for too?
2. **Market Makers:** You want us to literally just stop, leave, and use a casino? Use DraftKings and that sort of platform, ok. Now what, how do you make your money off of ""dumb money"" when it's gone? You need us, we need you.
3. **\*WHY\* is a collective of people on Reddit such a danger?:** For the sake of arguing, before this happened, there were 800,000 of us just being collectively dumb together. LETS JUST SAY, combined, we had 1 billion dollars between 800,000 people. That's scary? You lost 2.7b in the first wave of short losses, then asked for help for another 3b. Do you know what that means? THAT MEANS, that hedge funds, as a collective, is the problem, NOT REDDIT.
4. **When we got together, it was a crime, when you got together, it was not a problem?** How can we be ""investors"" in a rigged game, literally, please explain it. We HAVE TO GAMBLE to make money, because those are YOUR RULES.
5. **Trading is passive income, not a job:** Yeah, it's a passive way to kill time for 95% of us, make a little side money, couple grand here or there, sometimes get lucky and make 10k. This is a lot for regular people, it's literally NOTHING to you, but debt payment and vacation funds for us.
6. **We are Degenerates and Dumb Money:** If a large group of dumb people cost you money is a problem...then why is a large group of smart people (you market makers and hedge funds) that manipulate costs to take dumb moneys money away, allowed?

Anyways, there is a list 3 miles long.

GameStop isn't about GameStop, it's a beacon of reason, it could have been any stock, Citron just picked the target and we used it.

Good Luck Diamond Handing gents. Think about it this way. No matter what happens, **THEY HAVE LOST MORE MONEY THIS MONTH**, than what average day traders have collectively made in 5 years. Let that sink in.

Edit: This blew up, appreciate all the support!

This is the revolution of our time. Decades of oppression by big hedge funds, manipulating the market when they are wrong, taking advantage of the average investor...

Why not? Well: 

Let me clear up some misinformation: market makers don‚Äôt buy shares all at once on Friday when the calls expire in the money; that would be fucking stupid. In simple terms, they buy as the chance of the call ending in the money rises (aka the stock price goes up), so they buy slowly on the days leading up to the expiration date. Their problem is that there is not enough liquidity in the market to have bought enough shares properly when those calls get exercised on Tuesday. 

Next week is going to be the biggest week in my opinion. And if they didn‚Äôt close robinhood, we would be gamma squeezed up to 700-800 by now or even more. But they did illegal shit to get away with it, and delayed the inevitable. Our friends at robinhood will have hopefully liquidated and switched brokers by Monday and set off the gamma squeeze paired with the call exercises on Tuesday and MM‚Äôs not having enough shares hedged properly to deliver. My opinion. 


You know the reason why they didn‚Äôt try that short naked ladder attack like they did that drive the price from 480 to 120 again yesterday??? Because we didn‚Äôt fucking sell. It wasn‚Äôt low enough for them to close very many short positions.

Looking at volume, at 120, nobody fucking sold. People probably bought the dip and took more shares off the market instead. They know that, that‚Äôs why they didn‚Äôt try to use it to bring the price to 120 again yesterday, and only kept it in the 250 ish range. that moment made me FUCKING TRUST YOU GUYS SO MUCH. The fact that MAJORITY STILL DID NOT SELL IS UNBELIEVABLE. They‚Äôre probably thinking the same thing. 

They‚Äôre literally shitting their pants. They have every professional risk analyst, Harvard data scientist, Harvard mathematicians, and the best financial analysts in the world working on this. 

Unless the SEC or FED step in (I don‚Äôt think the SEC will: https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/01/29/sec-reviewing-recent-trading-volatility-amid-gamestop-frenzy-vows-to-protect-retail-investors.html) They have no choice but to make us sell‚Äî and the only way they are going to do this is by psychologically torturing us until we do it. Bots spamming shit, robinhood cancelling, CNBC spreading fucking fear everywhere, short naked ladder attacks. 





TLDR ‚Å∫ THE ANSWER? üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Turn your fucking brain OFF. trust the process. Ignore EVERYTHING you see that comes from the media, and more importantly don‚Äôt let any fluctuations in the price faze you, IT IS ALL ARTIFICIAL DESPERATE ATTEMPTS AT SURVIVING. Trust the fact that these shitheads are working literally this next 48 hour weekend straight and sweating and screaming and crying and begging for bailouts, and meeting behind closed doors to come up with more shitty tactics, which won‚Äôt work on us because were NEVER FUCKING SELLING. We sit at home with the shares jerking off and spending our time chilling, while they‚Äôre in emergency overdrive mode. The fact that we have RETAIL INVESTORS who are willing to lose the money to prove a point, and are not scared, and don‚Äôt understand that much is ACTUALLY OUR BIGGEST ADVANTAGE RIGHT NOW. 

IMPORTANT:

don‚Äôt get burnt out or they WIN. I watch the ticker all day from 8 to 5:30. It‚Äôs so draining and I cannot keep it up forever WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT. come Monday, I am not looking at the stock until 1. I‚Äôm going to exercise, eat healthy shit, drink water, spend time with the family and set some time aside NOT thinking about GME. The exact thing they want is that we lose momentum or get stressed out and sell to ease our mind. Don‚Äôt let them win. 


I own GME, this is purely speculation, I don‚Äôt know anything for certain, and it is all my opinion. I like the stock, and believe in its fundamentals and leadershiP.


 E D I T: THINKING ABOUT NOT LEAVING Robinhood yet for one reason or another? 

Copied from my response to a comment below about someone saying it would take too long to liquidate and move to robinhood: 

Don‚Äôt liquidate your GME holdings, just take your extra cash you want to put in to GME and put it in another broker account ASAP. 

Robinhood is completely controlled by the person we‚Äôre fighting against. When we had momentum yesterday, they changed the 5 share buy max to 2 then to 1. They will always kill momentum because they are owned by the people we are fighting against. They will never allow you to buy again. 

In my opinion you should have switched brokers the moment this news came out. I think you can get it set up for Tuesday which I believe will be the biggest day. Letting us by 5 then 2 then 1 share? They have professional analysts; they know the limit that can be bought for them to be successful; and they can control the buying limit. if they can do this; they are basically guaranteed a win. They are controlled by the big guys, you have to get OUT."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092936.csv|StockTicker|['RE', 'CKING', 'CARED']|[]|['CKING', 'TRUST', 'YOU', 'GUYS', 'SO', 'MUCH', 'ORITY', 'STILL', 'DID', 'NOT', 'SELL', 'IS', 'VABLE', 'SEC', 'FED', 'I', 'SEC', 'CNBC', 'TLDR', 'THE', 'NSWER', 'OFF', 'THING', 'IT', 'IS', 'ALL', 'ICIAL', 'ERATE', 'EMPTS', 'AT', 'IVING', 'NEVER', 'CKING', 'LLING', 'ETAIL', 'STORS', 'UALLY', 'OUR', 'GGEST', 'NTAGE', 'RIGHT', 'NOW', 'WIN', 'I', 'I', 'WHICH', 'IS', 'ACTLY', 'WHAT', 'THEY', 'WANT', 'I', 'NOT', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'P', 'E', 'D', 'I', 'NKING', 'ABOUT', 'NOT', 'AVING', 'GME', 'GME', 'ASAP', 'I', 'I', 'OUT']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

**HEDGEFUND RISK**

First understand what's at risk for the hedge funds.  [According to S3 analytics,](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/gamestop-short-sellers-are-still-not-surrendering-despite-nearly-20-billion-in-losses-this-year.html) HFs have lost $20B on $GME so far.  Other reports have come out that [hedge funds have lost 15-20% of assets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/dan-sundheim-s-20-billion-d1-capital-loses-about-20-this-month#:~:text=Dan%20Sundheim's%20D1%20Capital%20Partners,target%20hedge%20funds'%20favorite%20positions) so far this year.  Using these two numbers we can make an estimate they have $80B at stake here ([Citadel was worth $33B on Jan. 1st](https://www.citadel.com/about-citadel/#:~:text=We%20achieve%20far%20more%20together%20than%20we%20ever%20could%20on%20our%20own.&text=Citadel%20named%20to%20Linkedin's%20Top,as%20of%20January%201%2C%202021) so I believe this to be close).  Because Citadel and Melvin struck a deal, we can assume they are all in this together.  This prevents a [prisoners dilemma](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prisoners-dilemma.asp#:~:text=The%20prisoner's%20dilemma%20is%20a,expense%20of%20the%20other%20participant) for any one of them and makes retail investors battle $80B vs. say an individual worth $2B.

Now let's assume short amount is 100% of float and they have reduced the high debt on Thursday's shady tactics.  This means to calculate daily interest we take:

* 50M shares in float ([according to Fin Viz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME))
* 25% interest rate = .25/365 = .07%/day
* Share Price = $300

$300\*.07%\*50M = $10.2M in interest/day.

At $300 share price and $80B in funds as long as they continue to acquire the minimum # of shares needed they can keep this up for ***21 years.***

*So that's their situation.  The question they are asking then is how do we improve our situation and ensure we gather enough shares to keep this going?*

&#x200B;

**HEDGEFUND GAME THEORY**

Ok so now assume you are a huge asshole that steals from poor people and has no respect for others.  You need ***shares*** and ***you want to exit your position so you can make money elsewhere***\*.\*  How do you do this?

There are three tactics likely:

1.	Settlement

* Let's go back to our shares needed (50M) and value of the hedge funds ($80B).  Dividing that out we see that if they pay $1600/share they would be bankrupt.
* To avoid bankruptcy but get out they likely will look for government intervention that has them pay $500-$1000/share
* So how would you do this?  You first use your friends to [convince retail investors that your share is worth less than $1K](https://twitter.com/realwillmeade/status/1355329408194719748).  Retail investors might even have an organization like [SEC say they are protecting us](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/sec-vows-protect-retail-investors-amid-gamestop-frenzy-n1256146) \- after all $500/share is more than retail investors paid.  You then settle behind the scenes with your cronies and come out with PR about how great this is! *(fuckers)*
* This is their best course of action because retail investors cannot do jack shit against it
* Edit: As others have pointed out the settlement could be with other hedge funds that own shares, not just government intervention 

&#x200B;

2A) Test Pricing - Low

* The first test they did was to see if they could scare us.  A [ladder attack](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l72r36/what_is_a_short_ladder_attack/) costs them nothing.  And if they keep price low enough they don't have to pay out on higher issued options.
* Clearly the ladder attack was very effective Thursday and Friday up until \~2:30pm (I'll explain why later).  I expect them to use this as needed to keep price in a range

&#x200B;

2B) Test Pricing - High

* Another strategy is to find a [price cliff](https://www.pricebeam.com/pricingpsychology#:~:text=A%20Price%20Cliff%20can%20be,share%20and%20revenue%20will%20drop).  Essentially they let price run up a bit and hope that everyone sells to lock in profits.  This is more risky and will be used cautiously.
* However I can't state this enough - **we might see price rise substantially on Monday in hopes that retail investors sell.**

&#x200B;

3) Work with GME to Issue Shares

* If they think buying is dying down, a share issuance allows them to grab a number of these shares and exit
* The reason this is not their best outcome is twofold: Retail investors can help subdue with a huge buy attack and GME has little incentive to upset a large portion of retail investors
* Still, keep your eyes out for this to happen as it will be a pivotal point

&#x200B;

Well this all sounds good and I need to get back to my yacht.  Let's do some price testing and call up our buddies to solve this in a couple weeks.  This can't go tits up.

*Wrong.  Retail Investors still have the power.*

&#x200B;

**RETAIL INVESTOR GAME THEORY**

So now you are a smooth-brained ape.  What can you do to stick it to the twats?

&#x200B;

1.	HOLD

* If everyone holds then HFs can't get shares.  This leads to a long, drawn out fight or settlement.  But guess what - at least the HFs are losing millions of $s a day and unable to screw around with other stocks
* This benefits the new retail investors because eventually your short-term gains become long-term gains (less taxes)

&#x200B;

2) BUY

* How do you prevent a wall of selling slowly lowering the price?  You build a wall of buying slowly raising the price!
* Whether you realize it or not retail investors almost lost Friday afternoon. RIs had two days where buying was diminished (fuck Robinhood) and therefore the ladder attack let HFs set whatever price they needed.  Thankfully retail investors pulled it off in the final minutes (maybe thanks to a whale)
* If retail investors continue to commit limit order buys to prevent the ladder attack from lowering price AND continue to adjust their limit order buys UP the price will go UP
* ***This is the most important though - the retail investor must commit to the idea that there is no longer a ""dip"".***  ***Price is now pre-squeeze and post-squeeze***
* If they can do this the retail investor wins.  The post-squeeze price will be where most retail investors want to sell (hopefully VERY HIGH) and all shares purchased post-squeeze will make profit

&#x200B;

3) FIND WHALES

* Anyone named Elon that wants to commit to the cause and also hates short sellers?

&#x200B;

4) DO IT QUICKLY

* HFs are spending 24/7 trying to find a way out.  The longer RIs let this drag on the longer a settlement is likely

&#x200B;

**RETAIL INVESTOR WINNING - WHAT TO EXPECT**

Now that we understand that what will winning look like?  Well we have two outcomes:

&#x200B;

1.	Successful Buy Wall Overwhelms The Shorts

* This could literally happen tomorrow with enough power
* The price will gamma squeeze, then squeeze, and then game is over
* Watch for massive market dips

&#x200B;

2) Retail Investors Own All The Shares

* While unlikely there could be a situation where everyone is HOLDING and shorts can't get their shares
* A ladder attack will lower the price to get retail investors to sell  - imagine a slow steady drop to $20/share
* After waiting it out a month or two eventually the HFs fold and a real buy and a real ask will go through at whatever the retail investors deem the share price to be (again hopefully VERY HIGH)
* EDIT: THIS IS VERY UNLIKELY AND JUST THEORY.  IT WOULD BE HISTORICAL TO SEE 100% OF ALL SHAREHOLDERS NOT PLACING AT LEAST ONE BUY AND ONE LIMIT SELL.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

* Hedge funds want to drag this out waiting for a settlement or retail investors to sell
* The retail investors best strategy is to BUY and HOLD.
* A successful retail investor strategy ***eliminates the idea that there is ""a dip"" to create a buying wall.***  There is only pre-squeeze and post-squeeze prices.
* A buying wall - supported by a swath of limited order buys - by the retail investor will move price up slowly day after day until this over
* One well-intentioned whale could end this tomorrow if they really cared
* Don't be surprised to see a settlement with government or another party come through if this drags on

The best things to do is buy futures and demand physical delivery. There are hundreds of times more paper silver traded than physical silver. Most of them are cash settled, but if we demanded the physical asset we could cause them to default and send the value of silver skyrocketing to its fair value.

Yesterday I was in the airport of a city thousands of miles from my home. I saw a guy scrolling / laughing to himself and I thought‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYou know, this guy looks a little retarded - I wonder‚Ä¶‚Äù

I approached cautiously. Still from afar, like a true creep I spied on his screen - Even from a distance I could tell that he was, indeed on reddit. After a moment, he looked up. I simply said:

‚ÄúWSB?‚Äù
‚ÄúYEAH!‚Äù

It was 100% a little weird at first, but honestly, we felt a kind of kinship immediately - and although I have felt like part of something special over the last few weeks, actually meeting one of you dummies in real life hit different.

We talked a bit about our positions (ha), how we helped save a movie theater chain. History being written. Balance of power shift. What it all means. etc. etc. etc.

As much as we joke here at WSB, yesterday was a perspective shift for me. I usually think of you guys as a bunch of faceless (if entertaining) internet fairies with impeccable foul language.

But yesterday I boarded a plane bound for home with a new friend from thousands of miles away and it made me understand that there are 6 (wait, now 7 holy shit) MILLION living, breathing people with names, faces, and stories out there. We're all doing something important together.

It was really significant moment for me - and I‚Äôd be stoked if there was a way I could help more of us experience it.

I‚Äôm so proud to be one of you retards.

**HOLD GME! DO NOT SELL! BUY THE DIPS! GME HAS NOT POPPED. I'm writing this only because it's a smaller $ value trade and some of you may be able to put a tiny amount in and get some food for your 9 children, or at least start paying child support. Loser.**

 I know a lot of you fuckers are already in MAC and we can make another round of people rich. Note I have a $1k stock position in MAC, so this isn't a big money maker for me since I didn't buy call options -- but I'm going to... I just want to share what I've found and how I see things, so hopefully we can have another round of poors becoming wealthy during this fucked up pandemic.

Why I think MAC is such a hold position is because look at the short interest: https://imgur.com/a/YY9Ymku. It has been at or near 70% for a long time and the short interest is dropping (see graph on imgur slide). Why I think this is important is because MAC was trading around $6 a year ago. I think a lot of shorts are already trapped at the low prices -- probably shorts at really low prices that can't get out because the current price. (That's my logic at least, someone with more market knowledge please let me know if that's not the correct way to think about things.)

Also, I think MAC has been collecting rent and has good financials/cash (like GME), so it is undervalued. (Can someone grab a good article so we can lay out the value play on MAC?)

MACs market cap is a lot bigger (5x's) that of where Gamestop was at. I think this may make it harder to squeeze -- but someone with more knowledge can maybe chime in.

Thoughts and help appreciated. And, if I'm totally idiotic, you can tell me that too.

EDIT: One other thought -- MAC is a good short-term and long-term play. If you look at options, they're really cheap. Now go look at the 5 day chart -- see how the stock has been bouncing off $23? If you buy the cheapest February call options, I think you can easily make it to $23 -- and I think there's a possibility for a lot of $$$$$ to be had. I can't trade options right now because it's taking forever to get money into my trading account (oh, yeah, I never traded until GME and I've never traded options, so again, I'm a retard). But -- DFV made the majority of his money on calls so if one of you fuckers strike it rich on the option, at least leave me a thumbs up on here.

There are large banks currently naked shorting silver on the futures markets one of them is JP Morgan. It is essential to understand that there is an interest in suppressing the price of silver as every increase undermines the confidence in the U.S. Dollar. 

What is essential to know about SLV is the following: 

> The sponsor of the Trust is iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC (the ‚ÄúSponsor‚Äù), a Delaware limited liability company and an indirect subsidiary of
BlackRock, Inc. (‚ÄúBlackRock‚Äù). The trustee of the Trust is The Bank of New York Mellon (the ‚ÄúTrustee‚Äù) and the custodian of the Trust is JPMorgan Chase
Bank N.A., London branch (the ‚ÄúCustodian‚Äù). The agreement between the Trust and the Custodian is governed by English law. The Trust does not have any
officers, directors or employees.

The same bank that is heavily shorting silver is the custodian of $SLV.  The last time someone tried to increase the price of silver the FED created a special rule to fuck them. The two speculators that tried and successfully (for a time) controlled the majority of silver were billionaires even before their action in the silver markets. After the intervention from the FED, they went broke, billionaires going broke isn't something you hear often. 

Be sure that you know what you are getting into and do not use money that you cannot afford to lose. If you think you can compete against the largest banks in the nation and the FED you are wrong. The price might go up for a time but the crash will be swift.

He'll be around in the thread to answer questions

We are going to look at¬†**Biocryst‚Äôs**¬†recently approved drug¬†**Berotralstat**, AKA¬†**Orladeyo**. It is a¬†**once-a-day pill**¬†given to patients with a terrible lifelong disease called¬†**Hereditary Angioedema**, that results in them having to¬†**frequently visit the Emergency Room**¬†for life-threatening angioedema attacks (check out Youtube for videos of HAE patients suffering from these attacks and using Berotralstat). It is estimated that this disease affects¬†**1 in 50,000**¬†people in the world, or roughly¬†**140,000 people**, so although considered a rare disease, it is still affecting a¬†**lot**¬†of folks.

The available treatments for this disease are¬†**all IV drugs**¬†that are painful and produce local reactions. Berotralstat is the¬†**first oral drug**. It achieved excellent results in phase 3 trials, and the US FDA gave it¬†**fast track**¬†status in 2018 and Japan gave it¬†**Sakigake**¬†status (type of fast track). Then¬†**on December 3rd, the US granted approval for the drug**. They did it very importantly with¬†**zero label**¬†statements--meaning that they had no concerns about side effects or dangers.¬†**On January 22nd, Japan granted approval**. The¬†**EU**¬†also met last week to discuss approval and will announce its result¬†**this quarter**.

So let's look at what the above means for this stock. First the drug is in¬†**HIGH**¬†demand. In the US there are at least¬†**10,000**¬†people with HAE. Despite the disease being frequently debilitating, patients are so uncomfortable about getting regular injections that¬†**only 7,500**¬†are currently being treated with IV injections. The other 2,500 are going¬†**untreated**¬†despite the high risks. Now let's look at the 7,500 patients on a prophylactic treatment. Based on numerous surveys by doctors, the company, and researchers, most of these people would prefer an oral treatment. Take a look at this peer-reviewed survey article finding that¬†[98% of IV prophylactic patients (the 7,500) would prefer an oral treatment and 96% of the non-prophylactic patients (the 2,500) would want an oral treatment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489436/).

No wonder then that one of the preeminent biotech analysts, Evercore's Liisa Bayko, wrote to her clients on December 4th that Berotralstat was likely to quickly¬†**take at least 30% of the HAE market**¬†based on Evercore surveys of patient and doctor demand.

Remember that this is¬†**just the US**.... Japan did not even have any prophylactic treatment until Berotralstat was approved there a few days ago. They have¬†**500 people registered with HAE**¬†and estimated¬†**2,000 ready to be registered**. [The¬†UK¬†is so desperate to add the drug for its patients, it did not even wait until the formal approval process to go through and gave¬†early access to the drug on November 9th](https://angioedemanews.com/2020/11/09/berotralstat-available-to-eligible-patients-uk-through-early-access-program/#:~:text=Berotralstat%20%E2%80%94%20an%20oral%20therapy%20by,before%20its%20potential%20regulatory%20approval).

The EU is not far behind, with its estimated¬†**20,000 patients**, with approval coming in the next few weeks. Then there is the rest of the world. The HAE patient population in¬†**Latin America**¬†is estimated by¬†**HAE International**, the most important advocacy organization for HAE patients worldwide and one of¬†**Berotralstat‚Äôs biggest supporters**, to be¬†**over 15,000 patients**, the vast majority of whom are poorly diagnosed and not prophylactically treated. Argentina and Brazil have the highest actual diagnostic rates. HAEI through its Latin American sister organizations is strongly advocating for Berotralstat in Latin America.

Next, it should be noted that Biocryst built a¬†**world-class sales team**¬†for this drug in the US and EU and signed a¬†**partnership with Torii in Japan**¬†to take charge of the large sales and marketing promotion there. It has hired dozens of professionals, most from its HAE competitors. Its¬†**vice-president**¬†and US general manager¬†**Allen Hodge**¬†was even responsible for the¬†**successful efforts of the HAE drug launches**¬†of Cinryze and Firazyr, two pioneering injectable treatments for HAE. You could not get a more promising leader for this task.

It should also be pointed out that this drug, an oral kallikrein inhibitor, is potentially of¬†**huge value for a host of diseases, including COVID-19**¬†(that is now recognized to severely affect the kallikrein-kinin system, and kallikrein inhibitors have begun to be tested against COVID19--see this (IV)¬†**kallikrein inhibitor trial that was just announced in Brazil**¬†for instance:¬†[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33472675/)),¬†**diabetic macular edema**¬†(which Biocryst just obtained a patent on a technique to administer kallikrein inhibitors for), many autoimmune diseases, and even some types of cancer.

Last but not least, how should this stock be valued based on this one drug? First, this drug is¬†**one of the 10 most expensive drugs**¬†(based on its annual cost of prescription) in the world, but still¬†**less than the price of its IV competitors**, at $488,000 per patient per year. This drug is being approved by insurance companies¬†**left, right, and center**¬†as their preferred treatment, all you have to do is follow¬†[R8](https://stocktwits.com/R8Plus)¬†or¬†[nickpd](https://stocktwits.com/nickpd) on Stocktwits to see how many insurance companies have been making it easy for patients to sign up for the drug.¬†[Optime care¬†even lets patients get¬†direct-to-patient¬†prescriptions now](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biocryst-scores-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-first-oral-option-to-prevent-hae-attacks).

So what does all this mean for sales? And why is the stock not valued based on just this drug alone (I will get to the others in¬†**future posts**)? I¬†**estimate conservatively**¬†that by December 2021, there will be¬†**over 6,000 patients on Berotralstat in the US, EU and Japan**, and I can share in a future post the graphs and calculations I made to get to those numbers. 6,000 patients annualized is up to¬†**$2.9 billion in annual sales**.¬†**Most**¬†of this is going to be¬†**profit**. At a¬†**conservative price to sales ratio of 7**, that should produce a price of¬†**$121, not $8.52**!  If you want to play around with the math yourself, look [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLvclUzTqCitwKfawL7kGCLquJxA2T7IJKLg52VWotE/edit?usp=sharing).

And that is¬†**just the beginning**. Because Factor D and Galidesivir are going to be much bigger than Berotralstat for reasons I will explain in future posts. Remember that¬†**its Factor D drug, which is showing superiority to all other anti-complement drugs in Phase I trials and was fast-tracked and given orphan status by the FDA and now is in Phase 2 though not officially announced by the company eyt,**¬†and can be used in at least 20 diseases including common ones like Rheumatoid Arthritis, is currently¬†**not even factoring into BCRX's valuation**. Consider that¬†**Alexion with its significantly inferior anti-complement drug was just sold to Astra-Zeneca for $39 billion**¬†because of the¬†**recognized potential of anti-complement drugs**¬†for a host of diseases. BCRX even has has¬†**other drugs like Peramivir, already approved for Influenza and able to be used for the next bird flu pandemic, and its FOP drug--a story for another day**.

So why is this company, with¬†**zero risk of dilution**¬†due to an¬†**amazing royalty deal**¬†it signed in December and¬†**three super-drugs**¬†each worth tens of billions of dollars, and a host of other exciting developments to look forward to,¬†**worth only $1.5 billion right now?**¬†It can only be because the company's stock has been¬†**relentlessly shorted in 2020 and 2021**¬†to allow for significant accumulation by institutions. That is why the stock¬†**only went up 168%**, yes ""***ONLY***""¬†**168%**...

The time for BCRX investors is¬†**now**. My next post will be about Factor D, brace for that one. Factor D is 10 times bigger than Berotralstat! Good luck to all!

When I found the channel I expected to find a total degenerate. I expected to see some tool sort of like u/WSBGod but with lucky real gains. I was super wrong.

What I found was an extremely smart, soft spoken, humble, and graceful individual.

He found true deep value in a stock and bet on it in a big way. Over the past several months he was welcoming people to challenge him. He was welcoming people to poke holes in his thesis. As GME grew and grew he meme-ed but never gloated. 

This GME situation has now exploded into something that no one (not even DFV) could have foreseen. I can't imagine what is going on for him and his family right now. 

He has been living in a rented house and now he is a multi-millionaire. People here see him as a deity. Some people here are demanding he speak. Hedge funds probably want to see him ridiculously prosecuted somehow for his DD posts. Some people here are demanding that he announce his next play. I have even seen some people here make serious suggestion that he get into politics. 

I think everyone needs to have mad respect for this guy. With that respect we should all understand that what he decides he wants next for himself might not be what some of us envision. 

The world is honestly his oyster right now and he could go in any direction. Maybe he doesnt want to be in the public eye and wants to be left alone. Maybe he wants to be the next Burry with his own Scion Capital. Maybe he just wants things to stay the same as possible and just do youtube videos from his likely soon to be not rented basement. Whatever his choice is this entire community and the world in general needs to respect it. 

I also see people here writing ""If he is holding. I am holding."" This is fine but people need to understand that he likely will not tell us when he is selling (he shouldn't tell us for MANY reasons). In addition, we need to respect that he IS ALLOWED to sell if he decides to do so.

GME for many has become a venue to personally fuck the system down to your last dollar, but it may not be the same way for him. I personally am holding my position to the bitter end for that reason, but he may not. Others may not. DVF is at the core a true value investor. You will learn this if you watch his videos. Value investors typically do not buy and hold stocks forever. I am very interested to see how this ends for him. We all need to respect what one another does with their money. 

From the early days of this forum there have been some major wins that were phony as fuck. Nothing about DFV is phony. He is completely genuine. He is the real Wall Street Bets God.

His name is u/DeepFuckingValue. Let's put respect on that name for what he has done and continue to respect it when he decides how to end it. 

TLDR: In watching hours of DFV content there is no way that you cannot like this guy. He is very smart and very humble. We need to support him should he want privacy. We need to respect him should he exit his position."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092933.csv|StockTicker|['I']|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'MANY', 'IS', 'LOWED', 'GME', 'I', 'DVF', 'I', 'DFV', 'DFV']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME']

&nbsp;

# NIO

###### Why NIO?:

- NIO had an **astronomically good** 2020 and really solidified themselves as a legitimate EV company in a fast growing sector. EVs are the literal future but NIO isn't just EVs üòâ More on that later. But for now, EVs are the MOST popular stocks to buy and hold and this will provide a **TON** of stability for NIO and make it a definite high growth stock. **THIS IS LIKE IF YOU COULD BUY TESLA FOR 60 DOLLARS!!!** Don't miss out, this stock has about the distance between the earth and fucking **MARS** left in terms of growth. But you must be asking, why?

- Why: NIO is entering the EV space in China **AND** Europe, in fact it will be the leading EV company in China, and this is huge for a multitude of reasons. 

 - China is the biggest vehicle market in the world right now.
 &nbsp;
 - It will be a big player in China's pivot into lowering emissions and focus on going green.
&nbsp;
 - China loves Luxury vehicles and NIO vehicles are the _definition_ of [luxury](https://i.imgur.com/s5iuFKh.jpg) when it comes to EV's right now especially their new vehicle unveiled during NIO day earlier this January the ET7.
&nbsp;
 - **NIO IS NOT TRYING TO REPLACE TESLA, NIO IS ESTABLISHING ITSELF AS IT'S OWN BRAND** and I will go more indepth into why NIO is developing itself into MORE than just an EV company later.

&nbsp;

###### Who Matters:

- NIO's CEO **WILLIAM LI** is a literal genius. Dubbed the Elon fucking Musk of China. He has the drive and the motivation to launch this company to the fucking MOON üöÄüåô.

- NIO's Head of AI **Dr. Ren Shaoqing**. This guy is also quite literally a genius. He is the top researcher for NIO's autonomous driving software and this is great news for NIO's SaaS (Software as a Service) and will generate NIO a *TON* of revenue.

As far as background on the company these guys give the company an insanely bullish outlook but that's just the beginning.


&nbsp;

###### Why Now?:

- The closest upcoming catalysts for NIO are **January Deliveries**. (Will be announced sometime during the first week of February) and earnings **March 9th**. These dates are super important and will be **crucial** in NIO's upcoming breakout so keep these in mind! üöÄ

- Deliveries and Earnings are so **crucial** because NIO has consistently been on the uptrend and consistently smashing every projection. NIO will _absolutely_ beat expectations as usual and **LI BIN** will not let you down.

- **THESE EVENTS ALONE COULD TRIGGER THE NEXT BULL RUN FOR NIO TO MARS** üöÄüåô. The company is super underrated right now and getting in before the explosion that these catalysts could cause could be one of the most solid plays you ever make. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE üöÄüöÄüöÄ

- NIO's Price Target has been consistently raised over the past few weeks of NIO consolidating.

- NIO had an **extremely** successful NIO day unveiling their plans for advancing NIO into the future and revealing their new [Luxury](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ppSFaFQHAsY/X_tJH_-d4JI/AAAAAAAAQgk/lZ5iMk3_4Ws_1XFjog51w-r0lfos4D6OQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1920/nio-et7%2B%25281%2529.jpg) [Electric](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qD-V4W4K4k4/X_tJ1jtmPpI/AAAAAAAAQg4/7Gr4OSMhq2IbWo9FPLLM6BDT8laWO740wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1920/nio-et7-interior.jpg) [Sedan](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qD-V4W4K4k4/X_tJ1jtmPpI/AAAAAAAAQg4/7Gr4OSMhq2IbWo9FPLLM6BDT8laWO740wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1920/nio-et7-interior.jpg) the **ET7**, and the [NVIDIA](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nio-partners-with-nvidia-to-develop-a-new-generation-of-automated-driving-electric-vehicles) Drive Orin chips for their AI Driving NVIDIA-powered supercomputer named **ADAM**. There is even more tech they are bringing soon such as better batteries, better autonomous driving tech, better cameras and sensors for detection while driving on the road, BaaS (Battery as a service), SaaS (Software as a service), and their battery swap stations that are quick and easy to use and are located all over China.

- There was so much hype over the ET7 in china that the NIO app **CRASHED** from getting too many preorders. üöÄ

- **NEW** [Factory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/kxf8e7/chinese_media_picking_it_up_new_factory/) built in China and [Europe](https://i.redd.it/8eq9eqb8hja61.jpg) expansion is right around the corner.

- NIO is not in the spotlight and is in what some would call the ***GOLDEN DIP***. NIO is dipped off of lack of news and hype in other stocks making it the absolute *PRIME* to buy calls on sale and **HOLD** until we land on **MARS** making this the perfect buying opportunity.

&nbsp;

###### What makes NIO not *just* an EV company?:

- NIO is differentiating itself from other EV companies by introducing **NIO Life** into NIO's growth as not only an EV company but a **BRAND**.

- NIO in China has a near cult-like following where customers can indulge themselves in the NIO culture. They can earn points by driving their NIO vehicle and contributing to the green movement then use those earned points to buy NIO brand products. You can read more about it [here](https://www.nio.com/nio-life). It is really interesting and if it seems corny to you, well it is! But the truth is the typical person loves this kind of brand building and it **really works**.

- To build on this NIO has **NIO Houses** which are recreational buildings in public for NIO users to interact with each other, read, study, host speeches, look at new car models, play music, a kids room and most importantly a **NIO Cafe**. You can read more about it [here](https://www.nio.com/nio-house).

- NIO offers special services to it's customers that I will briefly cover such as their special Power Home at home charging stations, Power map locating nearest battery swap/charging stations for you, quick battery swap stations, and [Free Lifetime Roadside Assistance](https://www.nio.com/nio-service). 

**ALL OF THESE THINGS TOGETHER MAKE NIO AN INSANELY FUCKING SOLID COMPANY AND AS CORNY AS SOME OF THE THINGS MAY SEEM THIS IS HOW THEY ARE BUILDING A STRONG AND LOYAL CUSTOMER BASE**. People are already falling in love with NIO in China and there is somewhat of a small cult-like following building itself around NIO.


&nbsp;

###### Why NIO will be very profitable very fast:

- NIO is building a strong customer base due to reasons mentioned above and most of all they are offering their BaaS, SaaS, and [0 down payment](https://cnevpost.com/2021/01/21/nio-allows-customers-to-buy-cars-with-0-down-payment/) to their customers now as well as the release of their new EV Luxury Sedan which will cause a **huge** boost in sales.

- NIO's [BaaS](https://www.nio.com/nio-power) plan is efficient and consumer friendly as well as being unique to NIO. They work heavily in NIO's favor by getting the customer to sign up for a subscription service to receive the newest batteries and the battery replacement is easy and fast. NIO's BaaS will generate a **solid** revenue stream for NIO. NIO's battery swap stations are very quick getting a full battery swap done in **THREE MINUTES** and with NIO's newest OS 2.9.0 the car will enter the battery swap station itself, have parking assist, and allows [summoning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QguVzh8q3M&feature=emb_title). 

- NIO's expansion into the green space in Europe will be another profitable revenue stream for NIO and further its brand and recognition in the EV space.

&nbsp;

# Closing thoughts and Addressing possible concerns:

- I want to close this out by saying I am in no way a china shill I just see a value play and am here to share my DD with the rest of you.

- I urge you all to do your own DD and find reasons for yourself on why to invest in NIO and why it is a strong play this year. My DD is simply my opinion that I believe in.

- My price target for NIO EOY is *minimum* 200+, I am very bullish on NIO and I feel the upcoming catalysts will be what launches NIO into the stratosphere üöÄüåå.

- For those that are curious why NIO is trading flat and didn't read too much above it's because NIO has had no *recent* news and is in what I consider to be the *golden dip*. The significant news is coming up soon and it's better to buy **before** the launch while it is in its current consolidation state. 

- Shorter term PT is **at least** 80 by mid March.

&nbsp;

# TLDR;

NIO is a strong upcoming EV company with a variety of unique ideas that differentiate it from the typical EV company. NIO's BaaS, SaaS, Battery Swap Stations, NIO Life, NIO House, and it's sleek looking new [electric sedan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySguV2TwE6w) the **ET7** along with upcoming deliveries announcement the first week February and earnings this March are just enough reasons to üöÄ NIO ‚û° THE üåô.

Check the profiles of each of the top gilded posters in that comment section. Also the main post. Active account history no older than 3 days. And each came back not to talk about the most popular investing story in recent history, regardless of whether they supported it.

The main post has 200\~ gilds, and has a post history of two, less than one sentence posts from 8 months ago before making the most popular ag post.

One account started posting for the first time in 9 years to promote silver.

Another users first post isn't even to casually comment on the most important investing story in recent history but to make a 12 paragraph argument for silver.

I'm confident this will get downvoted to hell, but fuck it.

Early GME holders (people who bought <$50 or so), you can keep walking. You're all most likely safe and will profit from your holdings and trades.

People who're buying GME at current levels, maybe I'll be completely wrong and you'll make a million and cash out at the top and lose nothing... or maybe, I'll be right and it will be loss porn galore for days. I'm leaning towards the second.

**Here's why,**

GME is trading at a ridiculous premium, short squeeze or not, gamma squeeze or not. If you're buying in now, you might see a few days, or even a few weeks worth of green that will be life-changing... but most of you will end up losing to an enemy you don't even think you're playing against. I'll explain this in a bit.

Right now, the general public and especially WSB consensus is that GME is going to keep squeezing because of 100%+ short interest, and that's a fundamentally valid reason, but those who are buying these GME shares, where do you think they're coming from? Here's a hint.

Initially, Melvin and Shitron were the primary shorters. They shorted the stock around $10 or so, thus making their max profit $10/share if GME had gone bankrupt. But as you keep squeezing higher, and even worse, as you keep buying at higher prices... Though Melvin and Shitron would be forced to close positions with hefty losses (I say would because I don't know for a fact that they already have despite what CNBC says), many other hedge funds would've opened new ones. Now, why the fuck would they do that? Simple, you gave them an opportunity to short a stock that was worth $10 a few months back, and is now 30x that... raising potential returns by at least 30x. Of course, the stock doesn't even have to go back to $10, even at $50 or $100 newly opened shorts would see sizable returns, and the only people who get truly hurt will be the ones who longed at these ridiculous levels.

Think about it., who do you think keeps lending out more shares to the retail investor? New hedge funds who previously had no skin in the game, or had a very small position at best!!! You don't think you're playing against them, but you are. The energy and focus seem so concentrated on Melvin and the gang that you don't even realize there are vultures waiting for a complete bloodbath.

Eventually, time will come when profit-seekers (with long positions) will begin entering the market, or when retail investors would've exhausted their capital and the price will come tumbling down faster than gravity taking hold of vulture shit falling from the sky. It will be a matter of a few thousand shares entering and the domino effect will bring it all down in a matter of days, maybe even hours.

The fuck am I trying to say? Well, I'm not advocating for a liquidation here, and neither am I telling you to stop buying. That decision is yours to make with the information you gather. All I'm saying is look around for more enemies as prices keep skyrocketing. You, the retail investor, are walking through the valley of beasts with every intention to make the rich bastards pay, but just know, there are a lot more of them gathering around this battle with each $ GME goes up... and not a single one of them stands agnostic, they've all got a bet open and it's most likely against you at these levels. This is becoming as much an opportunity of a lifetime on the short side, as it was on the long side when the stock was in single digits.

Hope you all have a great weekend and do well in Feb."|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093312.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'WSB', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'CNBC', 'I', 'I', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

**(here is how you know it is bad: when the front page of fucking imgur is reposting from WSB talking about how evil the stock market is)**

Here is all you are doing by continuing to double down on stuff like this and 'diamond handing'. **You are buying someone else's risk and letting them cash out and go home.** You are being left with the bag, when GME and all the other memes collapse, and will wonder what you did wrong (probably blaming the market). If you want to buy my stock at exuberant prices under the guise of being a social activist, ill gladly offload my risk to you and walk away and I am sure every other bank and hedge fund is gladly doing it to. GME could gap up another thousand and I will still say the people buying are idiots for the same reasons above.

What I found is actually super interesting, to me anyways. But dont forget, past performance does not equal future performance and this is all just speculative, but then again banks and people do have patterns, so if it is as highly manipulated as they say it is, maybe this is something. Anyways heres my retard document I spent far too long on.

https://imgur.com/gallery/gA6gbZP

So bassically we have a batman pattern in 2008 and were curently on the right ear of a batman patern right now. Whats interesting is the VW infinity squeeze happened in October 08, just to the right of batmans ear. We are currently in the middle of a GME infinity squeeze, and are currently, on batmans right ear. The difference is what side of batman the crashes are, in 2008 the crash is to the right of batman, in 2020 the crash is to the left of batman. So that kills the pattern right? Wrong, in 2008 The fed didnt start the quantiative easing until 3 months after lehman brothers went bankrupt and the worst that could happen, happenned. In 2020 the fed Started QE as soon as possible, thus the reversed sides of batman make complete sense.

With all this said, this could mean that SLV will finish it's batman ear and the gme squeeze will crash SLV and then a recovery to ATH, it could mean that because of the reversed crash patterns SLV will start climbing to ATH without finishing batmans ear, or, the most likely scenario, this means absolutely nothing and I just wasted a couple hours of my weekend.

EDIT: I think I should clear this up, I'm not advocating to dump gme and buy slv. SLV wont start rising to ATH until after the GME infinity squeeze. We need it to happen

On Thursday, when all the Robinhood chaos unfolded and the price artificially plummeted, I saw the opportunity to jump in and picked up a single, Feb 19th $320 call.

**Come Monday, I'm prepared to buy up to $100k+ worth of stock and/or options.** However, I first want to explore a couple of various scenarios that we may see play out and think through the potential effects with you guys ... no matter how unlikely they are. I'll try to be succinct.

# Scenario 1: issuance of new blocks of stock at ~market value

**EDIT: THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE ( I was not aware )**

&#x200B;

~~If I'm not mistaken, Q1 for Gamestop begins Feb 1. Say they want to capitalize on everything by essentially, sending a bailout package to hedge funds - the very ones responsible for shorting them in the first place. This would be in an effort to shore up their finances and provide them enough capital to easily explore ways to adapt their business. Likely, this would come with strings attached. e.g. Hedge funds receiving new shares cannot sell for n years.~~

**~~Potential Outcomes:~~**

1. ~~HFs close out their short positions and short interest plummets. No more squeeze looks promising because the only shorts remaining would be those which shorted in the $300+ range. üíéüôå don't have a strong incentive to hold, nor try to compete against these remaining shorts. Retail selling begins.~~
2. ~~?~~

# Scenario 2: short interest isn't all telling

We are all aware that short interest is extremely high - quite likely still over 100%. However, with the recent blast of all media coverage from *reputable* networks, all are claiming Melvin, Citron, and Muddy Waters have all closed their short positions. I find this hard to believe and suspect. Sounds like a shitty PR campaign and obvious plea/attempt to instill fear.

Let's just assume that these reports are true. We can then infer that this extremely high short interest is more likely held near the $77, $160, $380 - $483 levels (just taking daily highs).

If that's the case, for the sake of argument, let's assume the $77 shorts have closed their positions - helping drive the price up to the next levels.

**Potential Impact:**

1. Short interest remains extremely high, but the current market value ($325) is not enough pressure to initiate a squeeze - assuming these firms have enough capital to not be in danger of a margin call. Or, perhaps those that are in trouble, have decided to sell off other positions in the market to remain in good standing - hence the overall market decline this week.
2. ?

**Potential Outcomes:**

1. &#x200B;
   1. üíéüôåstay impenetrable. However, it becomes an extremely long dragged out war until they get tired of paying the short interest fees which are insanely high - especially for new shorts.
   2. üíéüôå turn paper. Without deep pockets, we would need continued institutional longs to help push this into a squeeze.

&#x200B;

There are plenty of holes in each scenario on why it's so unlikely or not possible. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this as well.

Without Robinhood, this whole thing probably wouldn't have happened and WSB would likely be stuck at 100k subscribers like it was 3-4 years ago. Because lets face it, a hugee percent of WSB use(d) Robintard because we're too low-functioning to use brokerages that use >4 syllable phrases like ""money market fund"" or ""moving average""

Something like this happening right before going public was **GOLDEN** for them. All they had to do was not be a corrupt sellout bitch, keep their huge influx of new users happy, and they would've been set to come out of this a more respectable, even larger brokerage, as well as a high-value public company.

Instead they decided to expose the raw underbelly of their shitty business model and go exactly against their entire mission statement. Even if capital/margin requirements was the reason for the restrictions (it was definitely a factor but protip: it wasn't the full story), it doesn't change anything about the end result. Who the fuck wants to use a BROKErage who can't guarantee functionality during historical black swan events that usually result in the largest transfer of money? And then, **even if** they can't maintain capital requirements to execute trades, they could have handled it better. Just fucking pull the money from somewhere. Take out a huge loan from somebody ASAP. You can always get instant money if you don't give a fuck about interest rates, which they shouldn't because it's short-term and like I said, it would've been **HUGE** for the future of the company. Another one, they could have restricted both buying &amp;amp; selling of the trending tickers, or just go down altogether (RH users are very familiar with the app being down and losing full functionality, why is this time any different?). Yeah it would've sucked but at least it would've fucking stayed consistent with their mission statement of fair, democratic trading for all. I fuckin work at Wendy's and I can still imagine several better alternatives than the BS ""difficult solution"" they did.

And speaking of their mission statement, it's complete BS. It's just a sugarcoated way of saying ""lol we allow poor people to trade and have pretty colors"". They clearly don't give a shit about DeMoCrAtIzInG tRaDiNg FoR aLl. Because if they did, their business model wouldn't have been a Wall Street megacorp keeping the lights on by frontrunning user trade data.

And yeah another reason why ""volatiilty"" and ""trade volume"" excuses are BS is because they **increased** restrictions on Friday when both volume and volatility **decreased** lmfao. Screw this POS jokerage.

Edit: And the lawsuits up the ass. They just finished a $65m SEC settlement **LAST MONTH**, think their rainy day fund is big enough to handle something like this immediately after? Lmao gl


Edit: Tbh this fuckery was such a double win for Citadel because they get to force RH to manipulate the market while also signing their death note, which for Citadel means less retail investors....

The trench warfare has led to distinct cultures and ways of life.

Shorting hedge fund managers and their progeny now have a cult like worship of black holes. They believe the slow dissolve of their multi-generational wealth to interest rates is their holy birthright. Eventually they, like blessed light, will be absorbed entirely by the One True Lender Bank, and they will come out the other side clean and pure. They must not hasten the process, though, just as light cannot hasten its black hole rebirth. It was born with a direction and held it firmly, for eons.

GME shareholders now live in a caste system. Citizens wear physical symbols of their number of shares, like pieces of flair. Children inherit their parents‚Äô flair, and weddings are arranged so as to strategically join the shares and average price of two families. The vehicle of choice is a Tesla Short Bus, and everyone prays to Deep Fucking Value each night.

**Go to Vanguard**. Not Fidelity. Vanguard did nothing. No blocks, no limits. Nothing.

If literally every single person held, the hedge funds' prime lenders would have to liquidate everything and pay us whatever ransom we want.

But that's just the thing: While they DO want to use this opportunity to better capitalize, they DON'T want to piss us off after what is currently happening to Robinhood. IPO? Nope. Solvency? We'll see. So how does Gamestop take advantage of this spike in share price while simultaneously not pissing off an angry mob of retards who have already been fucked repeatedly?

Here's my idea: If the short interest is 120% of shares, Gamestop issues an amount of shares representing ONLY that additional ""20%"". And you may say ""Why negotiate a price?"" Because GameStop has a legal responsibility to negotiate the best possible price for the organization and its shareholders (many of us included). So they could issue 12 millionish shares at $2500/share ($30 billion to the books), while allowing all of us to realize those same gains.

""But what about the squeeze?"". That's the benefit of having a publicly traded company doing the negotiations, all kinds of financial models will be used to determine what the price of the squeeze, future interest, etc. would have cost, and it would be factored into the negotiated price.

Thoughts? Holes? Additions?

Position: 16 shares GME, diamond handed.

Edit: I'm being told my example of ""20%"" is way too high for what Gamestop is actually able to issue. If anyone is able to explain why they couldn't get more authorized, or what the maximum value they COULD issue is, I'll update.

üíéüôåüíéüöÄüöÄüöÄ My bad, typed it on desktop.

Edit 2: General responses have been, outside of me being a üåàüêª corporate shill, that GameStop can only issue $100m worth of shares now, which would barely dilute it and may actually help drive up the price more. The other point is that they can technically issue up to 240m more shares, but it would take weeks to move through the process to authorize more. Would appear my concerns are unwarranted in the short term."|2021-02-01 09:31:40.014459|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093312.csv|StockTicker|['SOME']|[]|['DO', 'T', 'IPO', 'ONLY', 'GME', 'COULD']|['GME']

It wasn't and this is some dangerous misinformation as it needlessly makes /u/DFV a target. DFV is simply an eagle-eyed investor who bought into his GME positions quite a while ago, even before anyone here cared about GameStop's fundamentals or the remote possibility of a squeeze. He isn't some mischievous troll who decided sometime in early January to rally all of us into a stock-buying frenzy in order to stick it to some villainous wall street firm, nor did he ever make any special effort to promote GME in order to incite a squeeze. A large number of users here had known of the outsized short interest for a while so this entire thing was the organic result of increasing GME discussion.

I think it's important to remember to keep your head straight during this time.  Many people here have probably never felt the fear & stress of having so much on the line.


Even though I've been 'responsible' in that even if i lose everything I've put into GME / BB so far goes to shit I will be ok, it's still pretty stressful.  I can't imagine what some of you must be going through who truly put everything they have into this.  And with some of you guys with millions of dollars on the line.  Fuckin crazy shit

Please share your thoughts on how you manage your stress, and how you can make sure to stay determined to keep your üíéüíéüôåüôå.

Fucking Robinhood restricting GME last week really makes me paranoid as fuck that they will just shut down the whole app at the moment of reckoning, and everyone will just miss the whole boat when GME truly moons.  And when they turn it back on we'll be the ones left holding the bag.  


But, my recommendation is to think about yourself when you're an old man/woman. In 50 years when i look back on this time, I know I would regret selling too early way more than selling too late.  So for that reason I know i'm holding all the way to zero if i have to.

It is a long process involving paperwork but  In order to skyrocket the price of actual silver you have too force the comex too buy more silver and slv isn't going too take delivery on anything as long as the naked shorts are In controll and the dollar is more powerfull.

‚òÑ‚òÑ‚òÑ‚òÑ‚òÑ‚òÑ‚òÑ
This action if done on a large enough scale will throw such a wrench In the works that you might not even care if you had ton of gold because you will be much more concerned about the bomb sirens and gunfire you hear too worry much about it.

 I, until the recent developments with Gme   was waiting for silver to drop much lower ($17 level) before buying physical; I am still waiting for a sharp drop, but have become much more tentative In my thesis due too the implications of what's going on. I do believe that they were able to gather enough ductape and spitwads on thursday too keep fiat In tact for now.

TLDR: The only way to blow up the silver market is to take delivery on  futures contracts and force the comex too buy large amounts of silver on the open market.

Edit: I know we're all pretty broke so suggesting emptying out the comex is quite a stretch but with the amount of money I've seen some of you making I'm sure you could afford a $100 face bag of 90% just too get the ball rolling. For the record I'm not buying at these prices but like I said I'm tentative, and either way one day $27  will seem like an absolute steal.

However, the whole time I was a little puzzled with how severe the reactions from Wall Street have been, especially this week. ""The company had more than 100% of its stock sold short! That's never happened before!"", you say. I know, I know, but that's [not actually not a new thing](https://www.forbes.com/2006/08/25/naked-shorts-global-links-cx_lm_0825naked.html?sh=f59ff078400b). A short squeeze, even one of this magnitude, should have squoze by now with GME up more than 10x in the span of weeks. Something is just not right. **I think there is something much, much bigger going on here. Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**

Here is my hypothesis: I think the hedge funds, clearing houses, and DTC executed a coordinated effort to put Game Stop out of business by conspiring to create a gargantuan number of counterfeit shares of GME, possibly 100-200% or more of the shares originally issued by Game Stop. In the process, they may have accidentally created a bomb that could blow up the entire system as we know it and we're seeing their efforts to cover this up unfold now. What is that bomb? **I believe retail investors may hold more than 100% of GME** (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company). This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

For you to follow this argument, you need to go read the white paper [""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) so you understand how the hedge funds can create fake stock out of thin air and disguise it so it looks like real shares. They use these fake shares in [short attacks to drive the price of a company down until they put them into bankruptcy](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D). This practice seems to be widespread among hedge funds that go short. There is even a term for it, ""strategic fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver."" Counterfeiting shares is extremely illegal (similar level to counterfeiting money) but it's very difficult to prove and even getting the court to approve subpoenas because of the way the financial industry has stacked the deck against investigations.

This completely explains why so many levels of the financial system seem to be actively trying to get in the way of retail investors purchasing more GME. It's not just about a short squeeze, it's about their firms' very existence and their own personal freedom. We have the opportunity to put all these people in jail by proving that we own more than 100% of shares in existence.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via [13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme) that they own more than **102,000,000 shares** (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen). Now, I don't know the delay/variance on these ownership numbers, but I think there is a pretty solid argument that close to 100% of GME is owned by these firms, if not more.

Moreover, there are now more than 7 million people subscribed to r/wallstreetbets\~\~. I know lots of people here are sitting on a few hundred shares that they bought back when it was under $50. Some of us are even holding thousands. If the average number of shares owned by each subscriber is even close to 5-10, we have a very good shot at also owning a similarly enormous amount of GME.\~\~ **Even if the average was just 10 shares per legit subscriber, that puts the minimum retail position at about 30-50% of the entire company.**

GME has been on the NYSE threshold list for almost a month. We don't have January data yet, but I just analyzed the data from the [SEC's fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver list for December](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) (all 65,871 lines of it) and looked up the number of shares that were likely counterfeit. For comparison, I did the same for a couple random tickers. Most companies have close to no shares not show up. Of those that do, it's a relatively small number of shares. For example, two random companies: Lowes ($LOW, \~$125B market cap) had 13,960 shares fail to be delivered at its highest point that month, Boston Beer Company ($SAM, $11.5B market cap) had 295 shares fail to be delivered.

How many shares of GME failed to deliver? **1,787,191.** As the white papers points out, the true number of counterfeit shares can be 20x this number. How bad do you think that number will be when we get the numbers for January? I'm willing to bet its many times that. Look at how that compares to other companies' stock:

[Histogram showing number of shares that weren't delivered in December \(x-axis\) vs the number of companies that fall into that bin \(y-axis\). GME is an extreme outlier.](https://preview.redd.it/g723jvyhine61.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=39bad6c47b428d364de36e9888de35b79572d1da)

I think this explains all the shenanigans going on the last few days. There is way too much counterfeit GME stock out there and DTC, the clearing houses, and the hedge funds are all in on it. That's why there has been such a coordinated effort to disrupt our ability to buy shares. **No real shares can be found** **and it's about to cause the system to fall apart.**

*TLDR; We probably own way more of GME than we think and that is freaking out Wall Street because it could prove they've been up to some extremely illegal shit and the whole system could implode as a result.*

EDIT 0: Looks like I truly belong on this sub. On the first version of this post I didn't read the file description properly and summed a cumulative distribution. My numbers were wrong, but I have updated the plot and post with the correct numbers.

EDIT 1: You should also note this is the distribution for NASDAQ tickers, not the entire NYSE. I doubt that the distribution trend is any different though.

EDIT 2: Evidence that Fannie May and Freddie Mac were killed in 2008 via short attacks using counterfeit shares: [report](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf). Exactly what I think they were trying to do to GME.

EDIT 3: A lot of people were hung up on the ""3 shares per wsb subscriber thing"". I know many accounts are bots, I was intentionally underestimating that number. I have adjusted to 10 shares per ""legit subscriber"" to reflect this without changing the total amount I think retail owns.

EDIT 4: What I'm seeing on Twitter makes me think I'm being interpreted a little too hyperbolically when I say ""Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**"" We're not going to go back to mud huts, people.** This could just be really disruptive for a short amount of time and cause a number of firms to face liquidity problems, possibly bankrupting some of them. Life will go on and I'm confident regulators and government will step in and protect people if necessary. Hopefully they pay more attention to enforcing securities laws going forward to prevent this from happening again.

EDIT 6: I am getting thousands of messages. I won't be able to respond to all of them. Here is an FAQ:

1. *How do I learn investing?*I am not an authority on this, but my personal opinion is to first learn how to read a company's financial documents and value businesses and only then start thinking about putting your money into specific stocks. Read ""the intelligent investor"" by Benjamin Graham for this. Then learn how to think about picking stocks. I like Peter Lynch's books for this.
2. *What is going to happen this week?*I have no idea and I wouldn't dare to guess.
3. *Are you going to be killed?*I don't know where people are getting this idea. I have no special knowledge or insider contacts, and I am in no way, shape, or form an expert on the market or the system behind it. Please treat my tinfoil-hat conspiracy theories as just that. There is nothing to gain from harming me and I have no doubts about my safety. These are just personal opinions and I don't have any schemes to ""take down the shorts"" or anything like that. I do not advocate for you to buy, hold, or sell. I'm just postulating on how we might have found ourselves in this place."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092925.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'DTC', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'SEC', 'F', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'NYSE', 'I', 'I', '$LOW', 'B', '$SAM', 'B', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'DTC', 'GME', 'D', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'EDIT', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'EDIT', 'ASDAQ', 'NYSE', 'I', 'EDIT', 'I', 'GME', 'EDIT', 'A', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'EDIT', 'I', 'EDIT', 'EDIT', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

I'm proud of you all for holding and the squeeze ain't squoze yet.

But everyone here that üíéüôå should know you still need to have a price and sell when you get there. All the new people here seem sound like they are just gonna hold their 1 share of gme forever and they are never gonna sell. That they are doing this to send a message to wallstreet hedgefunds. 

If you never sell, someone else will. You may not care about that, except for the fact that you're not going to send any message if they don't pay us! If you never sell and just want to bag hold and be part of the movement, that is some serious retard shit. You need to take that sweet squoze short juice. 

If this is a ""movement"" or cult or whatever, about transferring wealth and making hedgefunds hurt, you are gonna eventually need sell and take their money. You don't have to set a limit order, some brokers or stock tracking apps let you set alerts. Set it and if it goes off login and sell that shit.

No one know how high it will or won't go. No one knows how long it will last or when it will start, the days to cover is probably higher now that volume has gone down.

Could it go to $69,420? I doubt it, but if it did I would be sitting on 6.9mil dollars so that would be sweet. 

I'm glad everyone has their üíéüôå I just want everyone to walk away with their new fat stacks of hedge fund üí∞üí∞üí∞, and you're not doing shit if you are bag holding and they pull this shit back down to $10 or $20 after the squeeze.

It wasn't just one day, it was multiple days. Now we all know he is sleazy scum and I hope the company becomes insolvent.

I am mad at hedge funds and how they are connected to these brokers. This is a HUGE conflict of interest. Guess who else is connected to these cock gobblers? Janet Yellen. That boomer is part of the problem and received huge speaking fees from Citadel. Thankfully the Treasury and the SEC are two different entities. I wanna see people go to jail for clear manipulation. 

I am mad that I can't be there with you guys holding GME and being part of the good fight. Here I am deployed in the middle east and I'm locked out of all my accounts due to 2FA. I know this may make me a hypocrite, but I am mad for the little guy. The retail investor who can never win. They tell us to invest but when we beat them at their own game, they cry, whine, and do shady shit. 

I want to make them bleed. They are down $70 billion. I want them down another $70 billion.

As we also know, Melvin got an emergency cash infusion of $2.75 billion last Monday from Citadel and Point72 to help them with their GME shorts. 

On a post the other day someone sent the following helpful [link with positions hedge funds have](https://hedgefollow.com/stocks/GME).  Did a search for GME and at the bottom of the Top 20 hedge funds that own GME is Citadel With 111.8k shares which is only .01% of their portfolio.  It says their position is new but believe this list is as of Q4 2020.  This is confusing me as this position contradicts their support of Melvin which may be going bankrupt if we have our way.  Unless they are holding to hedge the support of Citadel?   Any thoughts on this?  I want to see both Melvin and Citadel go bankrupt and hate to see one of them profit off GME mooning.

Does anyone have an updated list of hedge fund positions or a list of what stocks hedge funds are shorting?

TLDR, Why does Citadel have a long position in GME?  I don‚Äôt want to see them make a dime off of GME mooning.

DD:

I dug up Melvin SEC filing and saw that they have 5.4M GME shares put in Sep (an increase from 3.4M shares in June) https://sec.report/Document/0000905718-20-001111/
Most likely their short position is around the same or up to 7M in December, but I doubt they have a much larger position than that.


Melvin claimed that they covered their shorts on 01/27. GME‚Äôs price on 01/27 is ~$360, so it cost them about $2B to $2.5B to cover. This matches the bail they got from Citadel. Also LB, one of Melvin‚Äôs top holdings had a violent dip on 01/27 - this could mean Melvin had to liquidate some other positions to cover. Melvin has another SEC Filing due Feb 14 for December, so we will have a better idea about their number.


S3 reports that short interest reduced by 5M shares https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=21 on 01/27. This matches with the shares Melvin covered.


This means there are still 58M shares that are not yet covered. What we are seeing in the last couple days are the tip of the iceberg, the squeeze will be much more violent in the next couple days if we üíéüñê 

I don‚Äôt think that many of these are new short positions because:
1. Shares are incredibly hard to borrow at this moment
2. Hedge funds tend to target low risk high ROI stocks. This means easy/cheap to short shares with negative sentimental


Bottom line: hold on tight üíéüñê because we‚Äôre gonna go for quite a ride üöÄ üåï

Now that $GME is on the verge of squeezing it appears that $AMC has been anointed as $GME's little brother. This is a mistake because $AMC is diluting via debt to equity swaps and other forms of dilution. $AMC did a 600m debt to equity swap from silverlake this week and I believe they will sell more shares into the market this week or next week to deal with their debt load and lack of cash flow. $AMC is going to take this opportunity to de-lever and avoid bankruptcy. As more $AMC shares are created the squeeze will end.   


$BBBY is more similar to $GME and it was Michael Burry's second biggest holding behind $GME. $BBBY and $GME both have cash on their balance sheet, generate free cash flow, and have their debt under control. $BBBY is buying back between 5-10% of their shares through February 27th and will not sell shares into the market. I think some retards are mistaking $BB for $BBBY. Blackberry has a low short interest and will not squeeze but Bed Bath and Beyond is the the 2nd or 3rd most shorted company behind $GME. Melvin is short $GME and $BBBY but not Blackberry. When Melvin is finally defeated he will have to close out his $BBBY position alongside his $GME position. We can inflict maximum pain on Melvin by raising the cost to borrow $BBBY shares but this tactic will not work with $AMC or $BB shares.  


$GME is the best choice but the most effective way to crush Melvin and get bonus tendies is $BBBY not $AMC

**Anatomy Of A Short Attack**

Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.

-----------------------------------

**Typical tactics include the following:**


**Flooding the offer side of the board**

Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.

The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. **They will do what has been called a short down ladder.** It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.

**By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral.** If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.

Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.

Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:

-----------------------------------

**Media Assault**

**The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.**

The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.

One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This ""mistake"" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ""Due to a mathematical error"" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.

Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.

This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.

-----------------------------------

**Pulling margin from long customers**

**The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover.**

-----------------------------------

**Paid bashers**

The shorts will hire paid bashers who ""invade"" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher).

This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.

-----------------------------------

**Analyst Reports**

Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned ""friendly"" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.

-----------------------------------

**Planting moles in target companies**

The shorts plant ""moles"" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.

-----------------------------------

**Frivolous SEC investigations**

The shorts ""leak"" tips to the SEC about ""corporate malfeasance"" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed ""confidential inquiry"" is leaked to the short media.

The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.

-----------------------------------

**Class Action lawsuits**

Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.

-----------------------------------

**Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc.**

If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.

To quote [u/rocketboomgo](https://www.reddit.com/u/rocketboomgo/): "" Silver Bullion Market is one of the most manipulated on earth. Any short squeeze in silver paper shorts would be EPIC. We know billion banks are manipulating gold and silver to cover real inflation. ""

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l71rdv/silver\_biggest\_short\_squeeze\_in\_the\_world\_slv\_25/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l71rdv/silver_biggest_short_squeeze_in_the_world_slv_25/)

**SLV:**

5. SLV is trending #1 on twitter & reddit - [https://stocktwits.com/rankings/trending](https://stocktwits.com/rankings/trending)
6. JPM was fined $900 million for market manipulation of silver but have since gone long silver, realizing they can no longer hold down the price. **Google it! Now other banks are stuck holding massive short positions and have no way of getting out.**
7. Ed Steer on $SLV "" it showed they added an absolutely mind-blowing 34,419,524 troy ounces of #silver. Wow!"". It is a **LOGISTICAL IMPOSSIBILITY to deliver that many ounces of silver in one day**
8. It took only 3 brothers to squeeze the tiny silver market in the 1980s **to 15x price**. Imagine what millions of robinhooders will do in 2021.

10. This is an ETF **backed by physical holdings of silver**

12. Peter Schiff, CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, said on Twitter, ""It looks like the #reddit raiders have turned their attention to #silver stocks. They're getting smarter.

13. Reddit day traders are turning to silver for their next short-squeeze target. Go to **Reddit** and search the ticker $SLV and look at what you find.
14. Silver's has, and will have an increased industrial demand ‚Äì led by **new green energy and 5G telecoms installations**. Silver finds three-fifths of its end-demand from industrial, medical and technological uses.

Unlike gold, silver is currently trading well below its all time high in 2011 of over $50
15. Also, silver is a Hedge against inflation. Hedge against chaos

The bullish pennant is one of the basic patterns traders learn to recognize when they start trading.

Looking at all the technical indicators of this chart GME should be ready to move higher by roughly the same length as the previous rally before the consolidation happened (the triangle shape is the consolidation).

If the plot that on the chart we end up at $933 for the next peak, so yeah $1000 is probably really not a meme, its fucking possible for sure.  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Of course it only happens if enough people buy the stock on monday, but with 7.3 mil degenerates on WSB and the entire world hearing about GME for a straight week in the news, smart and dumb money will flow into this stock on monday.  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Meanwhile the SPx, SPY, QQQ, are all looking super bearish, and ready to do a steep correction, so probably GME is one of the only safe stocks out there to invest in right now. The rest is all a short!!!! This has been brewing for a couple of months, and many respectable hedge funds indicated end of december they expected a -10% correction on the broader markets in Q1 2021. That means tech, and finance, and everything will go down (which has been already happening last week).

This is not financial advice or any kind of advice, this is just one autistic degenerate talking to himself. I WOULD NO NOT BUY THIS STOCK, it's highly volatile. It might cost you all your investment.

That being said, it did buy this stock again on friday and I have been feeling sick all weekend. If you can handle the stomach churning and dizzying swings you probably are just as autistic as I am, and this is a great stock for such retarded degenerates who want to prove their manhood in other ways than banging their girlfriends sister.

EDIT:

1. To those thinking I predict 933 as the top with this post, no that is not what I am saying, I just think that's a possible next rally, and 933 could be where the next consolidation happens, but maybe this could go much higher. Also you all peer pressured me into holding till I die, so I guess I will never make bank on this one.
2. To those saying TA does not apply here, I believe TA always applies anywhere, but TA is only 20% of trading analysis, the rest is fundamentals....oh wait you are saying fundamentals went out the window in 2020? ..... so yeah, this is just 20% of analysis the rest is I DUNNO WHATEVER, WELL SEE, still better than the casino's.
3. I got many questions where to find charts like this, it can be found on tradingview dot com website where many traders share charts and ideas.
4. probably this is a retarded analysis, I told you I am a total degenerate autist, don't get worked up about it, print it and wipe your ass with it for all I care, put dont bash me, jezus, you really would bash an autist retard? what kind of human being are you?

**Disclaimer; I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice or an encouragement to others to take certain positions. I am fully retarded and had crayons for dinner last night. Also, I wear a helmet all day long and I can‚Äôt even cycle.**

In anticipation of next week, I need get something off my chest regarding the financial authorities, brokers and the media. We all know how Wallstreet has ruined the economy over and over again with the 2008 crisis being the most recent one. What was Wallstreet doing when the economy collapsed and thousands lost their home and ended up in debt? That‚Äôs right; celebrating with their buddies because they made billions. They were literally laughing at the little man from their balconies while sipping champagne. What consequences did they face? That‚Äôs right; none.

Now a bunch of retards on an internet forum found out about Wallstreet making two mistakes of monumental proportions;*- Shorting more than 100% of a stock- Grossly underestimating how stupid retail investors really are*Now, as a consequence $GME surged to unprecedented levels and it seems the finishline has not yet been reached. Consequently, a few hedge fund managers are starting to get nervous because the red numbers are running up. Luckily for them, they have billions and friends in high places that would not mind a share of those billions. The result? Brokers shutting down retail investors, whereas hedge funds could short  and buy the stock freely. Some brokers actually may have had problems with clearing houses, but all of you know which brokers did what.  The ultimate goal of this short ladder was to trick people into selling. Unsurprisingly, they did not. The aftermath of this showed that hedge funds and brokers are holding hands and probably clenching their buttholes too.

It also showed that the media is beyond willing to stick their neck out to protect the big boys. The media have been portraying the hedge funds as the ones that REALLY know what they are doing, unlike those bubblehead retail investors. Simultaneously, we were described as ‚Äò‚Äôan alt-right platform‚Äô‚Äô. What?! We are a literal bunch of individual retards who just happen to like the same stock from time to time.

Financial authorities are calling market manipulation by retail investors. They are saying that hedge funds deserve the time to ‚Äò‚Äôrecalibrate‚Äô‚Äô their positions.They are saying they needed to halt trading to ‚Äò‚Äôsave the financial system‚Äô‚Äô. Well, let me tell you this; If the survival of the financial system is so strongly related to the survival of a hedge fund IT IS YOUR SYSTEM THAT IS WRONG.I don‚Äôt know man, but last time I placed a shitty trade I did not have the opportunity to call my billionaire buddies to ask them to halt the market so I can ‚Äò‚Äôrecalibrate‚Äô‚Äô my positions. If you make a dumb financial decision, you take the L and that‚Äôs that. The rules should not be changed after the game began and more importantly; the rules should be the same for everyone.

For years people have wondered how those people on Wallstreet make so much money. They have been shouting the answer from the rooftops for a long time; ‚Äò‚ÄôBE GREEDY‚Äô‚Äô.Wallstreet deemed itself absolutely unbeatable but the retail investors listened and they are hungry.The arrogance and blatant market manipulation backfired and exploded right in their faces and to be honest; they deserve it.

I‚Äôve seen dozens of articles about this not being the real value but in the end a stock is worth whatever people are willing to pay for it AND WE LIKE THIS STOCK. And let‚Äôs not forget guys; Since when do hedge funds give a damn about fundamentals? Thanks to Wallstreet we have seen unimaginable surges and crashes throughout the years. But now they are suddenly crying over fundamentals and about how they just want to make a living? Get of out of here, please.Due to the market manipulation last week it became obvious that this is not even about fundamentals; the free market is free until the poor start taking from the rich. Extreme surges are apparently only market manipulation if hedge funds are not in on it. Politicians, celebrities,  and working class people alike expressed their indignation about what happened. Hedge funds crossed a line here and the anger towards them is not misplaced. This no longer is about fundamentals (okay it kind of is because the short squeeze thesis is legit), but this is now also about morality. Hey Wallstreet and financial authorities; By trying to manipulate the market and squeeze some measly dollars out of retail investors you have turned yourselves into the biggest antagonists on the planet.

So to any financial authorities or hedgie spies reading this; I am holding my $GME. If it goes to 0, it goes to 0 but I am not selling.

To all my fellow retards and everyone around the globe following this; May the odds ever be in your favor and may your trip to the moon be pleasant. Godspeed retards

GME has already changed my life more than I could have imagined and I know that's true for many of you. But I'm not selling yet!

I want to see this thing through so I'm diamond handing my remaining 1000 shares. However, I came to the realization that **diamond hands may not be enough**.

Let's review where we're at, but let's do something to make it a bit more interesting. For those aspects we're not certain of, let's assume the *worst case* for gme retail. This is a helpful way to think through risks generally so why not apply it here? Let's go.

**Assuming Worst Case for Retail**


*All shorts are new shorts*

* Did Melvin and Shitron cover? Let's assume they weren't lying when they say they closed their short positions.
* But let's take that idea further and assume ALL existing shorts are NEW shorts. Remember, we're talking worst case.
* Shorts entered when the price was at recent highs so the pressure on them is not as extreme as previously thought. 
* Borrow costs would have been high but hedgies would have planned for that. 
* This means new shorts who bought high are intending to hold until retail eventually folds. They're prepared for a longer game.

*Gamma squeeze sqouze*

* There was no major benefit to closing above 320 Friday. We could argue about naked calls but we're assuming worst case here.
* The gamma squeeze already occurred earlier in the week when the price jumped over 320 forcing MMs to delta hedge open call contracts by purchasing additional shares. 
* This DID cause a price spike earlier in the week (remember we touched 500 at one point?). That was the gamma squeeze. Then RobinHood threw cold water on the party.
* I misunderstood gamma squeeze's and posted some incorrect info in my earlier comments. Ouch. Sorry!. I've gone back and edited those. For great info on why the gamma squeeze already sqouze check out /u/BlueEstee's [post](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8e9f3/read_this_if_you_expected_a_huge_gamma_squeeze/).

*Whales are big for a reason*

* I am suspicious of anyone who suddenly calls me a friend after my portfolio jumps in value. Aren't you?
* So let's assume that the whales who were hoovering up shares from the hedgies' ladder attacks are NOT retail's friend.
* Check out /u/jkn_k's [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/) in /r/investing  (I know, I know) which goes into great detail about how whales bought dips but those dips were still way above analysts' evaluations of gme, i.e. they still paid a LOT like in the 100-200s I'd guess.
* So we can assume whales share a near-term interest with retail - both want the share price to go up.
* But after that? Who knows? I'm sure whales won't want to hold any bags (remember they got big by feeding on smaller fish).

**What If? Worst possible future for retail**

Here's how this could play out poorly for retail:

* Retail mania drives the stock price up higher but not *too* high.
* Whales unload their shares to retail at higher prices and exit.
* Brokers either further restrict trading or some other obstacle prevents retail from driving the share price higher.
* Shorts hold and out wait retail. Retail loses interest or a black swan event occurs. There is no MOASS.
* The share price falls and retail take massive losses.
* Game over. :(


**What If? Gamma Squeeze Triggers MOASS**

* Going to the moon takes rocket fuel and that's where the gamma squeeze comes into play.
* Massive upwards momentum early in the week should trigger another gamma squeeze. 
* A gamma squeeze may force the shorts to have to cover and lead to the MOASS. 
* Remember a gamma squeeze occurs when the price goes up quickly forcing MMs to buy shares to delta hedge open call contracts.
* This occurred last week when we passed 320 which was the highest available strike.
* The highest available strike this coming week? I see a 800 strike in TastyTrade. Do we have to hit 800? No idea. Maybe someone with more wrinkles can tell us?


I want to give credit where credit is due here: /u/Pyr0smurf's posted some great DD on this to /r/options because it looks like they're banned atm from /wsb. Anyways - they make this [same case with charts here](https://old.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l8w7z3/currently_banned_from_posting_in_wsb_but_this_is/)!


**Why I'm Bullish on the Gamma Squeeze Next Week**

* It's in the whales best interest to see the price goes up to, so retail has professional re-reinforcements
* We have several possible Great Men of History - Cohen, Musk, Chamath - who may either buy shares or announce news that shoots things skyward leading to the gamma squeeze
* Retail interest is INSANE. Billboards? I love you guys. That is incredible. 
* Worldwide interest? Really?! Beautiful stuff. Hats off to europoors and other brothers and sisters around the world as well - much love for holding the line.

This not investment advice. And I'm not suggesting anyone make any actual moves or listen to me in anyway. Look at my past plays. Most of them are terrible. I somehow lost money on the Vegas play over the summer and I've lost money on TSLA more times than I like to think about. I bought BABA right before the ANT IPO didn't happen - then doubled down (that may work out yet though). Anyways - this is all for entertainment purposes!

so I am not paper handing, I have bought 100 shares in November and am still holding, though, I build too much suspicion over this weekend and I would love you guys t actually counterargument my thoughts, just so that I feel better.

Here are my thoughts why GME might already be over:

1.we don't know the real shorting numbers and the HF might have covered most of their positions already:

all the numbers that were presented on twitter & co are just guesses/were calculated by algorithms. Hedgefonds aren't dumb, they know how to outsmart these algorithms so that it looks like they are still holding their positions (this way they can short the stock again, before official numbers are published and make money). They had a lot of time to cover their positions in small quantities by now. Why would they just keep holding on their positions to cover them at the highest price? The short squeeze hasn't happened, that's for SURE. BUT: maybe it won't happen anymore, because they are prepared, because they covered most of their positions in the last week in smaller quantities (because they weren't ever forced to do it all at once, the price simply wasn't high enough, that was the case in the VW squeeze).

We have seen that the hedge funds have learned, for example, there was no gamma squeeze, they covered their positions early enough, not like the week before.

2.too much attention

don't get me wrong, attention is great, but maybe this whole thing is already done, because we had too much attention. Even porn stars have tweeted about gme by now, and I know out of experience that this often means a change of trend in a stock.

3.a lot of instability, just small bad news are a possible catalyst for a free fall

there is nothing that protects us from a free fall, and this would definitely mean the end for this story.

I am of the opinion this will not happen as we need to look at companies which successfully battled Shorters as reference- best one is Tesla TSLA:

a. We all know why GME price üöÄ, due to gamma squeeze from calls, buying of stocks and shorts covering - all these led to stocks being bought from float. So less supply and more demand = price go up bigly

b. Important to remember who are the parties benefiting from üöÄ - retail, whales and institutions who long shares and calls, and GME insiders

c. The manipulative actions of brokers to limit share buying by retail - share buy limit 1 - 5 shares and increasing margin to 100%, these are actually good for holders. Why you ask? Because that means retail buyers who have 100% cash to back their holdings can hold onto these shares without worry about having stop losses or increase margin requirements.

So with these 3 points once share price rocket and settled (assuming at $1000 to 1200), there will be some selling to recognise profits. But the price will not crater because simple reason, at that price GME has the capital to reinvent their biz - means more incentive for whales and institutions to hold as a value stock. Retail will mostly likely hold.

When selling takes place it will also be controlled, because people are not selling to get out of a sinking ship, but to make a profit. Look at TSLA do you see its price cratering because holders are dumping desperately? Buyers who got in later this week bought the shares between $200 to $300 on average, there is no reason to sell at massive loss once price üöÄ 

Sorry for rambling im using all my powers from 2 hour sleep. Pls fuck me up if my monke üêí brain anal ysis is wrong.

Melvin Capital Management, the hedge fund that has borne the brunt of losses from the soaring stock prices of heavily shorted stocks recently, lost 53% in January, according to people familiar with the firm.

Melvin was founded by Gabe Plotkin, a former star portfolio manager for hedge-fund titan Steven A. Cohen. It started the year with about $12.5 billion and now runs more than $8 billion. The current figure includes $2.75 billion in emergency fundsCitadel LLC, its partners and Mr. Cohen's Point72 Asset Management injected into the hedge fund last Monday.

As part of the deal, they got non-controlling revenue shares in Melvin for three years. So far, Citadel, its partners and Point72 have lost money on the deal, though the precise scope of the loss was unclear Sunday.

Melvin has massively de-risked its portfolio, said a client. People familiar with the hedge fund said its leverage ratio -- the value of its assets compared with its capital from investors -- was the lowest it has been since Melvin's 2014 start. They also said the firm's position-level liquidity, or its ability to exit securities in its portfolio easily, had increased significantly.

New and existing clients have signed up to invest money into Melvin on Feb. 1, according to the people familiar. It was unclear how much they would be adding.

Melvin had established itself in recent years as one of the top hedge funds on Wall Street, but a short position in GameStop Corp. hurt the firm in recent weeks. Losses extended beyond GameStop, with declines coming from throughout its portfolio during a period of market turmoil in January. Positions in which Melvin had publicly disclosed owning put options -- bearish contracts that typically profit as stocks fall -- in its last quarterly regulatory filing soared, while positions in companies it held sold off."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092936.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['AM', 'A', 'LLC']|[]

Some fund managers say the episode is likely to change how the industry works.

Fewer hedge funds are likely to highlight their bearish positions by disclosing put options, they said. Instead, funds may use Securities and Exchange Commission rules to keep confidential those positions, a tool activist investors have long used to build positions in companies quietly. More funds also may institute rules about avoiding thinly traded, heavily shorted stocks."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092954.csv|StockTicker|['WSJ']|[]|['SEC']|[]

Listen.

Fidelity and Vanguard are in a class of their own when it comes to retail brokers available to retail investors. Shithood, Interactive Dumbasses and so on do NOT compare. 

Shithood is a little startup that has to answer to hedge funds, HFTs (their main customers of order flow buys), and venture capitalists. Shithood CEO has no fucking idea what he's doing and is clearly vested in our failure.

## **Fidelity and Vanguard** üöÄüöÄ‚úÖ

Here come the big fucking boys!

Fidelity has **$3.3 trillion**, YES trillion, in assets under management. Vanguard has **$8.8 trillion** in assets under management. I am saying TRILLIONS, not little billions.

Guess what? **THEY ANSWER TO NO FUCKING ONE**.

## **Fidelity owns 13.67% of GME shares.** üí∏üí∏üí∏

And Vanguard? 6.27% of GME shares. 

https://preview.redd.it/8gutt1kephe61.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=574fc95b38139a8679a593999934fe531c796c6a

Source: [https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=GME&subView=institutional](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=GME&subView=institutional)

Collectively, **they literally own 21.10% of GME**. They are INVESTED in its success.

Consider putting your volume, our customer base, behind them. They are with retailers.

# **Okay, so what do I fucking do now?**

Open a new account in either of these brokerages. Deposit your money and buy GME! Fidelity gives you INSTANT funds as margin. 

# **LEAVE YOUR SHARES IN RH. TRANSFER YOUR MONEY OUT.** 

I know, this sounds fucking stupid. But your shares are needed in play next week. LEAVING THEM IN RH FOR NOW! HOLD DIAMOND-HAND IT üíéüëã

Transferring your assets (shares, options) takes [5-14 days with Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/customer-service/transfer-assets), and [similarly at Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/contact-us/faqs/what-investment).

# again: **LEAVE YOUR SHARES IN RH. TRANSFER YOUR MONEY OUT.** 

Do NOT transfer your shares from RH yet!! Just your money.

Here is how to **open a new brokerage account**:


## **Fidelity Brokerage account: [https://www.fidelity.com/trading/the-fidelity-account](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/the-fidelity-account)**


## **Vanguard Brokerage account: [https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/online-trading/](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/online-trading/)**

**FAQ**

*How long does it take to open an account w/ Fidelity?*

This is better than half the shills do out there going ‚Äúhaha NOK NOK go Brrrr‚Äù

I‚Äôm a smooth brain fuck but even I can see on January 27th bulls moved the stock to $8.83 from $5.87 a change of over 50%. FFS, if that‚Äôs not moving the stock I don‚Äôt know what is. Does that sound like an unmovable object?

There are a couple reasons we came down from that high so quickly, retail/institutional shorts were crawling all over this thing and the next day we were RESTRICTED from buying. I think there‚Äôs a lot more shorts on this than previously anticipated. Diamond hands are needed here as well as access to the open markets owe can buy and hold.

Volume is trending upwards recently as well. With a record setting day on the 27th.

If we take a look at three charts below you can see a similar pattern. All three are great stocks. All three are down from all time highs. Except one hasn‚Äôt been ‚Äúwoken‚Äù up yet.

Look, I cant do the level of DD some other people do on here and others have done a great job pointing out the positives, so I‚Äôm not going to beat a dead horse. All I know is NOK is sitting near multi-year lows (like some other famous stocks were recently), its volume is picking up immensely (like some other famous stocks recently), its based in nostalgia(just like some of the stocks that went up recently) and its getting a lot of publicity which makes my pants feel kind of tight.

It has not yet popped, not even in the slightest. Don‚Äôt just cast it out of your mind because you think its worthless. That‚Äôs the same shit people did to GME when u/deepfuckingvalue mentioned it a year ago. Now those same people are eating crow while he‚Äôs bathing in fucking tendies. Will this be the same as GME? No, GME was a special catalyst. Could NOK double or quadruple in a year? Yes, absolutely. Isn't that worth a look?

This is a game of chicken where reality tips greatly in our favor.

1. It costs absolutely nothing for us longs to hold onto our positions. Guess who has to pay to hold onto their positions?

2. Shorts can only try to shake us but the more they pressure us, the more our hands get encrusted in diamonds. Shorts can keep trying tricks but we have our own whales to see through them, meaning every dip is a discount and eventually, we will shake off all paper hands.

3. This collective will attain diamond hands. It is a matter of when not if. You have people who have nothing left to lose, betting everything they have on a chance to change their lives. You have people who are here just to make a point. You have degenerate gamblers who flip the finger to risk management. You have people who are just here for entertainment. These people are willing to see their money drop to 0 and this crowd is going international.

The only way out of this situation is to unwind the short interest and better now than later. If the shorts go bankrupt, as a broker, you are on the hook. Better close those short positions while the losses are limited to the shorts. Maybe you're enjoying the interest from loaning our shares out but the goal is to bust the shorts and we don't mind you being collateral damage (especially those specific few of you, you know who you are).

Hold strong** 



Full Article:


BY REUTERS ‚Äî 8 MINUTES AGO
By Svea Herbst-Bayliss

BOSTON (Reuters) - Melvin Capital, the hedge fund at the center of the GameStop (GME) drama, **lost 53% in January** but received commitments for fresh cash from investors in the last days of the month, a source familiar with the fund said on Sunday.

Melvin ended January with more than $8 billion in assets after having started the year with roughly $12.5 billion in assets, the source said.

The firm, founded in 2014 by Gabe Plotkin, had bet that ailing video game retailer GameStop's (GME) stock, which traded at less than $5 five months ago, would fall. But a wave of retail investors, comparing notes on social media platform Reddit and using online trading app Robinhood, took the other side of Plotkin's trade to send the stock up 1,625% this month to close at $325 on Friday.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the loss.

Hedge funds Point72 Asset Management and Citadel gave a $2.75 billion capital infusion to Melvin Capital earlier in the week, enabling it to close out that position with a large loss.

""The fund's portfolio liquidity is strong. Use of leverage is at the lowest level since Melvin Capital's inception in 2014,"" the source said.

As news of losses at many hedge funds spread in recent days, speculation mounted about which firms might be forced to shut their doors. Several investors and fund managers said clients have been more patient with certain firms that have a long and strong track record, likely allowing them to survive this month's deep losses."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092933.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['BY', 'UTERS', 'NUTES', 'AGO', 'OSTON']|[]

AMC and GME are now historic, household names. Buffett didn't sell AAPL as shares climbed and climbed. He accumulated more every time public faith in the company wavered.


There is no price target for me. I will hold these shares until someone pries them from my cold, dead üíéüëê. Asset prices will continue to climb, and there will be increasing systemic pressure to invest. When other investors see that we aren't just trying to play these stocks, but that they are icons, trophies in our war chest, they will join with us.

The market tanked and we made a few thousand dollars. Awesome. Fast forward a couple weeks later and it was all gone. The main reason is because we were smooth brained idiots but the fundamental reason is because everyone (including retail investors) bought the fucking dip. Even if this GME thing somehow crashes the market, retail investors and large institutional investors alike will prop up the market.

I just want to clarify this GME rally is great. Greedy hedge fund investors got caught with their dick in the cookie jar and they look like fools and rightly so. There is a crude imbalance of wealth in the world and anything that helps put more money in the hands of the less fortunate is a good thing.  

By the way if anyone has GME calls, just know the ratio of puts to calls on GME is 3:1, for you smooth brains all that means is there is a lot of bearish sentiment on the stock, so just watch your tendies.

Since most brokers blocked exercising 0 dte calls on Friday. Would it be possible to exercise OTM calls before they expire for someone who doesn‚Äôt care about taking a loss just in order to obtain shares?

Ex: 

Retard has a 2/9 $400 call, and say by 2/8 gme isn‚Äôt above $400 (say it‚Äôs trading at $350) and there‚Äôs a possibility the call will expire worthless

retard exercises $400 call on even if gme is trading at $350, retard obtains 100 shares at a cost of $40,000 netting a $50,000 loss due to the current share price of $350.

Now this retard has forced the seller of the call to issue the 100 shares to him rather than having his call potentially expire worthless. Now this retard can hold onto the shares until the short squeeze can occur.

TLDR: Exercise the OTM calls rather than having them expire worthless if you have the cash and are willing to hold the shares. GME üöÄ (not financial advice)

Due to the exponential increase in membership in WSB I have started to see a lot of misinformation, favoritism, and overall divisiveness going on within the community. I decided to do my own Due Diligence (DD) to determine which stocks I will be holding next week, and hopefully this can start up a meaningful conversation in the comment section to help out our new friends who mostly want to know what to invest in.  I pulled the top 15 stocks with the greatest Options Volume from Friday (1/29). You can see all 4 of the $BANG stocks make this list. Despite understanding that GME is a heavily shorted stock with a Short Float greater than 100%, it is important to look at the Put Volume as well. This is the numbers of option contracts that are shorting the stock. GameStop is the only company of the batch that has a Short Float of greater than 100%, which is why this short squeeze is working so well, but it‚Äôs also the most heavily shorted on the options side. I think it‚Äôs important to see all 4 of the BANG stocks are heavily shorted on the put side too. If you look up who is buying these Put Contracts, it is mostly big institutional investors, whose best interest is to artificially depress the stock price so their puts pay out (look at what happened to BB and NOK on Thursday and Friday). This is why we have to stand together as a community and embrace the $BANG index that we created.

**GME** \- This is a short squeeze. Not much to say here. Buy, hold, don‚Äôt sell.

**BB** \- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. 66% of the float (shares available) are owned by institutional investors, so while the float might seem big (550M), we are only dealing with 34% of the shares. Buy, hold, don‚Äôt sell.

**AMC** \- Also a short squeeze. The Short float isn‚Äôt above 100% but this is still a great potential candidate.

**NOK** \- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. This is the weirdest one to me because everyone was claiming this was ‚Äúbot‚Äù propaganda last week and then has the 3rd highest option volume on Friday. Not sure how to feel about this one, but hey its popular.

**Defining some terms:**

**Short Float:** Percentage of shorted shares in relation to the total number of floated shares (shares available to be traded)

**Options Volume:** Total number of **option** contracts bought and sold for the day

**% Put:** Percentage of total option contracts that are puts (think the stock will go down)

**% Call:** Percentage of total option contracts that are calls (think the stock will go up)

**Put/Call Ratio:** Ratio of puts to calls option contracts (higher the ratio, higher the short %)

I had my first 6 figure day in the market on Friday when NVAX went from 134 to 235 overnight after reporting great efficacy data. My weeklies were up 9000%, it was incredible. I want to send a thank you to u/Upstairs_Speech for his posts in the past, I would not have thought of the trade if it was not for him.

Now before you all tell me ""I wish I saw this before the stock went up 70%"" let me explain to you why this is still early innings. Sure, this might not be as sexy of a trade as round 1 was, but now that data concerns are off the table this thesis has a lot less risk. This one is more of a low risk, high growth play as opposed to a get rich quick one.

Let's do a mental exercise:

The day is December 31, 2020, everyone is excited to be moving on to 2021. NVAX share price hovers at $110, a $7B market cap awaiting UK phase 3 efficacy data. There are real concerns as to whether NVAX actually has a vaccine that works given their prior 30 years of failures. The market prices this risk accordingly and NVAX's market cap is only **17%** that of MRNA.

Fast forward 4 weeks. NVAX has released data on 20,000 patients, shows the highest efficacy of any vaccine against wild type COVID. NVAX shows strong efficacy against UK strain which no one else has. They show that the South Africa strain is a real concern with efficacy at 60%, and there is 0 reason to believe any vaccine will perform better against that strain. 

And I can't overstate this part enough, the **really** important detail here is that NVAX is the only protein vaccine on the horizon. The only other protein vaccine coming any time soon is MAYBE GSK/Sanofi and they already showed terrible data. They blamed it on dosing but there are major question marks there and they are delayed 6 months minimum. The reason protein vaccines are important is because they are the only ones that can offer coverage against multiple strains in a single shot. This is how the flu shot is done (which NVAX just passed phase 3 of in March). The flu shot is a protein vaccine that covers 4 strains in a single shot. What is becoming very clear is that we are going to need the same for COVID. The future of COVID vaccines is that in your annual shot you get coverage against wild type, SA strain and Brazil strain for example. NVAX is the **only** company that can do this right now. RNA vaccines are too reactive to handle multiple strains. You can already see how many symptoms people get with the current vaccine.

This [thread](https://twitter.com/PeterKolchinsky/status/1354929042965864451?s=20) is gold and helped me to understand the situation.

The market clearly has not digested this sufficiently yet. How do I know? Let's go back to the exercise from the beginning. Given NVAX's advancements in the last 4 weeks their market cap has doubled, up to 14B. What do you think Moderna has done in that same time frame when their COVID platform continues to weaken? Up 5%? 10%? 20%? They are up 67% in that same time frame! After everything that has happened NVAX still only has **20%** the market cap of MRNA. It basically hasn't even caught up. The reporting from mainstream media on NVAX was an abomination, especially compared to how they covered J&J's bad data. The truth will emerge. The market will realize it and will see NVAX is still deeply undervalued.

I am obviously not saying that NVAX will inevitably be as valuable or more valuable than MRNA. MRNA technology is very valuable and they are an extremely ambitious company. BUT, NVAX is about to play catch up due to the glaring discrepancy. In addition to COVID don't forget that NVAX has an incredible flu shot, likely at some point to be the first RSV vaccine ever and their Matrix M adjuvant is now very valuable. Quick recap of differences between the two vaccines:

https://preview.redd.it/diljgsjmxoe61.png?width=425&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a0e94718b1185709f44d2de968aec6e566c4aa6

My belief is that NVAX gets to a 20B market cap very soon (50% upside) and I can't imagine a world in which its not at 30B minimum by year end (100% upside). Upcoming catalysts are finalizing 200M dose deal with EU, emergency use authorization in the UK and other countries will quickly follow, production partnership with Merck or GSK/Sanofi and others.

IMO this week will be very telling, if it is up on Monday buy and don't think twice. If it pulls back maybe give it a couple days to get a better price on options as it might consolidate for a while.

**Positions:**

75% allocated to 1/21/22 280 calls. If it gets to 30B market cap by expiration its over a 300% return and I think market cap gets there by end of summer so it would be even more profitable. Don't mess with the July calls at this point, they are too expensive. You basically get the same value and more time going with next January. IMO this one is free money.

25% allocated to 4/16/21 240 calls. If it gets to 20B market cap by expiration this is a 150% return. I think there is a somewhat decent chance it could be there by the end of this week but we will see."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092936.csv|StockTicker|['NVAX']|['NVAX']|['I', 'I', 'NVAX', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'NVAX', 'B', 'UK', 'NVAX', 'MRNA', 'NVAX', 'COVID', 'NVAX', 'UK', 'I', 'NVAX', 'MAYBE', 'NVAX', 'COVID', 'COVID', 'SA', 'NVAX', 'RNA', 'I', 'B', 'COVID', 'NVAX', 'MRNA', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'I', 'NVAX', 'MRNA', 'MRNA', 'BUT', 'NVAX', 'COVID', 'NVAX', 'RSV', 'M', 'NVAX', 'B', 'I', 'B', 'M', 'EU', 'UK', 'IMO', 'B', 'I', 'IMO', 'B', 'I']|['NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX', 'NVAX']

I have a noob question about the markets and our situation with GME. Imagine all of us regards won't sell our stonks below 69420$. Something very high. Small Melvin will not be able to put up this huge amount of cash, not even if the lender liquidates all their assets. What happens in that case? What happens if the price increases further and further and shorts aren't able to close their position? At some point, somewhere, some rules are going to get broken, right? Because this is a situation that should not happen and somehow can not happen. So what is going to happen to retail? Will the lender make some kind of deal with Melvin? Usually if you can't pay your debt, you will default into bankruptcy. And what is going to happen when shorts go bankrupt? Who is going to buy back the shorted positions? I assume it's no one, rules will be broken and the small retail trader without any lobby will pay the mess. 

To be honest, I don't have much knowledge about the finance industry, so this was going around my head - maybe someone with greater knowledge could tell me what is going to happen next?

Please don't get me wrong and downvote me - I am trying to understand the chances and risks of this play and also the greater picture. Because usually the big capital wins and not the retail pleb. As you can already see, rules are changed mid game because it simply ""can't"" happen that the big ones fail and retail wins. It is not intended to work like this, the system. So maybe I am completely missing something - can you discuss with me and help me understand?

Have a nice evening my regards and lets fckng HOLD the next week. Let them bleed."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092936.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'HOLD']|['GME']

This is a small piece so you should be able to kick your brain into overdrive and read around 25 percent of the words.

I wanted to let anyone unaware know that there will be sections of Wall Street also profiting off of this GME event. It's okay, nothing wrong that. In fact, you very much need them.

Please, do not be disillusioned into thinking retail buying power alone is enough to sustain the GME craze. You need Whales(billionaires on your side) and you need good Hedge Funds. For instance,
Black Rock owns 14 percent of GME and is making a killing. 

This might make you angry if your mission is to destroy Wall Street. That was never the intended goal from the beginning. The goal was to hit short positions where it hurts for their shitty and sorry tactics of profiting from the bankruptcy of companies. Who cares if hedge funds make money from companies prospering and growing? That's kind of the point of the stock market and the same reason you should invest.

I thought it important to raise awareness that retail investors are HURTING(in a good way) specific funds, and helping others. Such is life.

This shit will be crazy if it squeezes, don't get caught holding the bag.

I'm all in GME

He has a show on CNBC every weekday morning. He is well educated, level-headed, and very well informed. He also has contacts to every single large market player in the world.

&nbsp;

Dear David,

On Thursday morning there was a level of market manipulation that occurred on an unprecedented scale. Many people are blaming the brokers for refusing to take buy side orders on a large number of securities. The brokers have pointed the finger at the clearing house firms for increasing the collateral required for a trade from 1-3% to 100%. The clearinghouse firms are saying it was the DTCC (Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation) that raised collateral requirements. The DTCC has not said anything publicly; however, they have leaked it was their lenders who raised rates suddenly on them forcing these changes. The banks in question are the money center banks such as J.P. Morgan.

&nbsp;

**Counter party risk in the system**

The banks did this because of counter party risk in the system. In layman's terms, they did not believe the hedge funds had the capital to pay the bill as prices rose rapidly. David this is your time to shine. Bring on the banks, DTCC, and others involved to explain this to everyone. Wall Street is at risk of turning two entire generations against them because of the actions last week. Every millennial believes the market is rigged against them now, and rightfully so might I add.

&nbsp;

**Loss of capital**

The big story that is not getting attention in all of this is the options market. Retail investors had bought so many options in these underlying securities that firms were being forced to buy as they went higher and higher. This is a gamma squeeze, and it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. In many of the securities that were not Gamestop, the options bought by retail investors expired worthless or worth a fraction of what they would have been worth. The focus is all on Gamestop, but there were many other forces at work here. Had these stocks kept going up there would have been options worth 100-500x what they were bought for. This had potential to be a far bigger story than just Gamestop going to a high valuation.
This has to be brought into the light and thoroughly investigated. 

&nbsp;

**Yelling fire in a crowded theater**

There are many who don't think this was that manipulated. Let me pose this question to you. What if the S&P 500 was up 5% for the week, and you walk in on Thursday morning only to be told you can only sell the $SPY, and **NOT**buy it. How far do you think we would go down that day? I believe unequivocally we would hit limit down in the first 10 minutes. The panic and fear many retail investors would have as they suddenly were afraid they were going to lose their money would cause many sells. This is what happened on Thursday to a large number of securities.

&nbsp;

**Final Notes**

I have seen many on your network be very dismissive on this whole Gamestop ""movement"". Guests were angry, dismissive, and frankly rude to these dumb millennial traders putting money in Gamestop. This has to change if you want the next generation to join the market like yours has, and the one before them."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092933.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['CNBC', 'DTCC', 'DTCC', 'J', 'P', 'DTCC', 'I', 'P', '$SPY', 'I', 'I']|[]

They are not my words alone, but the words of all. Thus, these words do not constitute financial or investment advise.* 

**In the Beginning**

In the beginning, the markets were created. They existed in relative balance and beauty, providing a means for investors to participate in the steering of the present towards a better future. This happened organically through investment choices. The markets were a tool that aided investors in fulfilling the measure of their being created, by allowing them to create their own world.

This balance and beauty began to crumble in time, as various individuals and groups of individuals  conspired to persuade and even control the decisions of investors. Over time, they would be successful through the deployment of unquestioned measurement metrics for value, and countless media campaigns. 

And here and now, we stand.

&#x200B;

**The Supermassive Black Hole**

The markets stand on the precipice of deconstruction. Like all things in existence, and much like the universe itself, nothing lasts in any single state. Deconstruction and reconstruction happen at every given moment, sometimes in small cycles, and sometimes... in revolutionary ones.

We are on the cusp of a moment unseen by any other generation before us. The markets begin their journey to a singular, previously invisible, stock. This is happening at an increased rate, and ALL parties feel its influence. 

Individual investors, traders, and gamblers are pouring money in by the droves. Larger institutions are doing the same. Even hedge funds, some of whom have doubled or even tripled down on their positions, add to the mass of this one security. 

News outlets continue to cover the story. Even the news that is hypothesized to go against this event, heads towards it and increases the power of its vacuum. This very post does the same, even without my mentioning the name of the security.

&#x200B;

**The Death of WallStreet**

The Supermassive Black Hole Event ends how all things end: deconstruction (death). This could happen slowly, or it could happen very abruptly. Many will attempt to escape it, but nothing can. This event cannot be stopped. It can only be delayed or change form. 

Eventually, when the mass becomes too great, hedge funds will be obliged via margin calls to liquidate their assets (their clients' assets), in order to repay their loans to the institutions from which their moneys were acquired. Not all clients, though, as some could theoretically be protected by moving their positions to select safety securities.

This is likely to cause a market downtrend, and eventually a crash. Again, this could happen slowly, very quickly, or at any pace in between.

SEC will no-doubt intervene. The US government will also do so. We will also see brokers intervene in an attempt to slow what is happening. These efforts will all contribute to the event. 

Though the person who gets out first mitigates the greatest potential loss, you'll find no admonishment in this prophesy to do so. The hedge funds and big money will attempt to do so, and are in the process of doing so.

This is the light that is shined before you, to show you who lurks in the corners and seeks to rob you of freedom through calculated steps to keep you in poverty!

&#x200B;

**The Birth of FreeStreet**

And lastly, I bring glad tidings. This event will happen, regardless of any efforts. In the end, there will be a rebirth of the markets, more free, balanced, and beautiful than ever before. Wealth will be redistributed to some degree, but that was never the point here. And most importantly, a we will see the dawn of a new age. An age where people democratically elect the future of their own time, and the legacy they leave behind.

May the irons with which ye are laden be struck from yer wrists. God love ye.

I am a fucking retard so my math is probably wrong, but if its not it proves that $DB is MASSIVELY overvalued and presents an enormous short opportunity for retail investors like ourselves. Also, it just happens to screw over one of the most evil and corrupt banks in the United States, if not the world. (They also have more than 300B in Debt)

Overshadowed by the recent infinite money glitch known as $GME and $AMC, $DB experienced THREE gigantic scandals in one week.

Now that we are aware of the fraudulent and scammy work conducted by these assholes, lets analyze their share price.

**Current Share Price:** 10.12

**Historical (12 Month) Earnings Per Share:** \-0.89 (0.1 Q3 2020)

**Annual Sales:** 28.9B

**Annual Dividend per Share:** 0.10

**Historical Price/Earnings (Median):** 16.70

**Book Value Per Share:** 0.2939

([https://smallbusiness.chron.com/calculate-companys-stock-price-21802.html](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/calculate-companys-stock-price-21802.html))

I used two of the formulas presented in the above article Benjamin Graham & P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)

1. Projected Price using Benjamin Graham Formula

1a. SQR ((15)(1.5)(.1)(0.2939)) = 0.81 (actual value per share)

2. P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)

2a. ((16.70)(0.1)) = 1.67 (intrinsic value)

&#x200B;

This means the actual *value* of the stock is *Drumroll Please...*

Between  $0.81 - $1.67

&#x200B;

If my math is correct (and it probably isn't), then this means that Deutsche Bank's stock is MASSIVELY overvalued and is due for a market correction (hence the AMAZING shorting opportunity). Also, if I am wrong please correct me - I only would like to learn more about the market, so I can eventually lose $5,000,000 in an earnings call.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Current Price = 10.12

&#x200B;

I do not want to mess up the momentum of $GME or $AMC, I am only posting this because in the same way that we LIKE those stocks, I think we should also be open to DISLIKING some of the worst stocks on the market. Especially stocks with ties to CNBC and the other hedge fund assholes who have enslaved us with debt.

&#x200B;

Why was it removed? Posting again:

I‚Äôm tired of having to fight against synthetic money. An x $billion hedge fund really has 100x more at their disposal because they use synthetic money based on margin and leveraged trading. Eventually gains and losses are realized but not until the small people are on the losing side and the hedge fund is in the green.

If we could end their margin and leverage advantage that would make it so much more fair and less prone to manipulation."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092930.csv|StockTicker|['REAL']|[]|['I']|[]

My question is for the rest of the investors, the vast majority of folks who just buy mutual funds, ETFs and Indices? This is not a sanctimonious question or a ""Will someone think about the boomers"" question.  What is the actual market short term and long term outcomes for folks not participating in this? As there are hedge funds getting ravaged behind the barn, there are plenty of other funds that are making a shit ton of money, buying in with their discretionary in the last few days.  There are two guys in WSB that I know who work for Canada based funds that are laughing. Ex-colleagues in fact. Yes, it's an uprising but it'll also be other already very rich people getting richer.

I'm an active trader myself and will post positions at the end.  Retired 45 years old, former derivatives trader with enough in my account.  I went 1/3 cash on Thursday and will go 1/3 cash on Monday.  The rest will ride this out.  Accounts spread across 4 brokers. I honestly have no idea what's going to happen.  I can confirm with better than random certainty that in addition to GME, A LOT of other tickers are in the same position.  Teachers pension funds in Canada have fully liquidated some of their gains to free up cash. This isn't ending soon. 

What are the outcomes for the broad market?

I just got off a conference call with all your wives' boyfriends and I got some DD to drop on you. Everyone here knows about the big four stocks right now. If not, GTFO.

What I‚Äôm here to tell is to not focus 100% on these four and let other great opportunities pass you by. (Note ‚Äì What I am NOT TELLING YOU is to sell your GME. Hodor that sh\*t). While you all have been foaming at he mouth over your GME games, you‚Äôve likely missed what is going on with the rest of the market. Several great performing stocks have been dumping since this GME craze began. Oh, need examples?  To name a few you may have heard of: 

AAPL ‚Äì Down 5.11% 

AMD ‚Äì Down 7.7% 

BIDU ‚Äì Down 7%

DOCU ‚Äì Down 8.7%

F ‚Äì Down 8.6%

PINS ‚Äì Down 6.25%

NIO - down 8%

Wondering why this may be? Two theories They both might be right, or I might have a really smooth brain. 

1) These hedge funds everyone here is so keen on financially ruining need to cover their losses somehow. What better way than to liquidate stocks that have had crazy runs the last few months.  If this is true it will be extra enjoyable to watch them pay more to re-enter these positions when the stocks inevitably bounce back.

2) You people selling your shares in other stuff to buy more GME. (again, great job holding the line) I have seen several posts on here from other smooth brains selling their shares of some of those listed here. I applaud your enthusiasm for the cause and wish you the best. 

With these two combined, you end up with tons of shares dumping from these 401K stocks, with the buyers foaming at the mouth for more GME, NOK, AMC, BB. 

Once this is all over and the world of normies forget all about the GME madness, they are going to put their money back into their boomer stocks and standard 401K stocks. What does this mean for you? Don‚Äôt miss the dips happening all around you while the world is focused on 4 stocks and a shiba inu. If you have any extra money and cant afford GME, check out the rest of the market for buying opportunities. 

TLDR ‚Äì Keep holding the line! If you have any money left, buy the dips on others for bonus tendies

2. Bought 2500 at 30, sold at 42;
3. Bought 10 x 75 Calls for 10, sold at 35

Question: if every buys 1 share of a hypothetical company, let‚Äôs say $GME, the brokerages have different techniques to actually buy it. They could hold it for you, put it directly in your account, take your order and give you an IOU, all kinds. But it‚Äôs still 1 share. And you, the guy with smol leverage, are essentially the one holding it.


But if everyone had 20 bucks left over, why wouldn‚Äôt you use it on fractional shares of $GME. They are fractional to you but to the brokerages they probably have to hold the full/whole share to divide amongst the public. They are absolutely just held by the brokerage or some sub-holding company. So effectively you are forcing the brokerage to also HOLD GME, as it would be difficult for them to offload the shares if they are ‚Äòshares‚Äô by 30 different monkeys."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092956.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['$GME', 'IOU', '$GME', 'HOLD', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME']

We degenerate autist are a special breed. I think we have a chance to do something. I think we should create a Charitable Trust. We could weaponize our autistry for the good of mankind.
This idea is literally half baked but maybe we could run some paper trading contest, and take some of the top players, along with some experienced philanthropist (or is it philanderist?) to form the board of our organization. We could fund it with small donations, and multiply the effect by having our top autist invest the money (having proven themselves in our paper trading contest). We could start with u/DeepFuckingValue as a founding member of the board (I hear he wants to build an indoor track for his community as a start).
I would love to establish ourselves and then take on boomer Jim Cramer‚Äôs charitable trust in a trading contest, with the proceeds going to the charity of the winner‚Äôs choice. All of this is just an idea, we‚Äôd have to hire an attorney (or maybe one of you autist is an attorney) to begin to form something like this and get the taxes and organization established.

See how retarded you are?? Everyone else is also just as retarded if not more. Most opinions you read and news you hear and rumors about anything are wrong, and genuinely dumb or ill thought out. I too may very well be retarded. 

Most of the takes on Robinhood are wrong. It‚Äôs a traffic jam. The same guard rails that are supposed to protect the plumbing of the system in an off ramp on the left side of the chart are slowing the system in the on ramp on the right side of the chart. You just can't open up millions of margin accounts a day trading stocks that move 300% a day. Even the most liquid brokerage quickly becomes very illiquid holding all the liable accounts. By Tuesday they will have enough liquidity and shares will have settled and retail will be able to buy en masse. Robinhood is the #1 app in the WORLD right now. This is only going to accelerate. They will get the plumbing right and add lines of credit. Credit markets are fine, so Robinhood can access capital. To the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ 

In addition, all the folks transferring accounts OUT of Robinhood cannot sell. It can take 3-5 days for a journal to clear. That is forced üíéüôå, which reduces the tradeable float of GameStop, increasing the short interest as a percentage of the float. 

We will see more buying pressure this week, forced holding by transfers, more institutional buying, and algorithms from quant funds like Renaissance Technologies analyzing everyone‚Äôs autistic thoughts, and following!!

It was reported that OVER HALF of robinhood users had shares of GME last week, that is 6.5 million users with shares. We are getting very close to cornering the market, I think that may have contributed to the shenanigans at the end of the week.

I bought in at 18 and held. And I really want someone to answer this with the part of their brain that thinks, not the part that memes. That said... So I know the short interest is high, but what reason do we have to believe all the old shorts didn't already cover, like on those days where we had almost 200 mil volume and the price went to the moon? How do we know this isn't a bunch of new shorts, purchases at these ridiculously elevated prices with little motivation to sell urgently? People are acting like hedge funds live in a vacuum and can only sit and watch their money fade away despite whats going on being clear as day. I am honestly concerned the squeeze is being over played at this point, and it is mostly hype driving the stock. The shady shit that has been happening, as immoral as it is, HAS actually happen. Lets say they didn't go out and just flat out lie to the world and really DID close out those horrific shorts.

I'm not trying to rain on the parade, but I feel like this shit has hit a tipping point where devil's advocates get downvoted for not being a diamond hand apes and people are being blasted with this social justice narrative and just hype pushing the price up (or on friday, just holding flat).

Can someone make a good case why this isn't true and we are still in the same spot we started?

GME will be squeezed very soon and everyone has the potential to make more money then they ever dreamed they would see in the short course of a few months to two years. The stock has reached an extremely comfortable price for us to receive every profit of the short squeeze.

Even if everyone who has joined the GME train for a quick buck in the past few weeks pulls out next week, businesses and the huge mass of people who have the common sense to hold have already created a foundation for the squeeze to happen regardless.

This stock will be hitting $5000 by next Friday and there will be many that miss out. Those who pull out are going to be on the sidelines and, just like every other stock they had a hunch on, are going to just watch the gain percentage keep jumping. All the while, that pit in their stomach will keep growing as their despair reaches new heights.

By Monday, the stock will be leaving the station.

It‚Äôs important to realize that when you purchase a stock, the money you pay does not go to the company, it goes to the previous owner of that share. By buying stock you‚Äôre owning a (often) tiny piece of that company from someone else, unless the company itself did a direct stock offering their own. 

If you want to inject cash into a company the best way to do this is bonds which are basically loans, but this is WSB and no one is interested in a low risk return of 4% over half a decade.

AMC and AA were able to take advantage of the insane stock surge to offer new stocks, with which they received a cash injection of 300M and 1.3B over the last week respectively.

From Bloomberg News:

*‚ÄúAmerican Airlines revealed plans on Friday to sell as much as $1.1 billion of stock through what is known as an at-the-market program, which allows companies to issue additional shares at market prices. The announcement came after their stock was up as much as 38% at its peak last week.*

*Just a couple days earlier, AMC said it had raised more than $300 million through a similar program. Investment firm Silver Lake, one of the company‚Äôs main creditors, also seized on AMC‚Äôs surge to convert $600 million of bonds into equity, before selling the shares in the open market for a gain of over $100 million.‚Äù*

That‚Äôs insane, obviously there‚Äôs others buying shares but it started on Reddit, the momentum, hype, initial rallies..... led to the bailout of two multi billion dollar companies facing the very real risk of bankruptcy. Redditors probably just saved AMC and AA which is mind blowing to realize.

WSB MEMBERS, PLEASE, YOU MUST NOT ENCOURAGE THIS.

This place used to be full of educated people ""who didn't know what they were doing"". Now , it's just full of UNEDUCATED PEOPLE.

Please, consider that BUYING implies that your money is now INVESTED IN THE MARKET and that IF YOU NEED AN ADVICE ON HOW TO INVEST, YOU WILL PROBABLY SEEK FOR ADVICE ON WHEN TO SELL.

but guess what ? nobody will help you on that.

In fact, I am quite dumb. Right now 97% of my portfolio is in GME, the rest is PLTR leaps. All that follows is fan-fiction and speculation*

To understand what happened Friday you need to understand some things in the context of their timeline

**Tuesday**

*Regular Trading Hours*

options are still cheap. On Tuesday the price first broke over $100. You could buy 1/29 200c for $200 each (various times throughout the week those could have been sold for over $25k). the call volume was \*insane\*. so hopefully whoever sold those calls has the shares to cover them, right? Well, it turns out, most of the contracts were sold by *Market Makers (MM)* they literally make the market possible by providing the necessary liquidity to conduct trades. When MMs sell you options, they don't buy all the shares they need to fulfill that order. But if the option goes in the money, then they'd better have those 100 shares, because someone will be exercising it.

*Afterhours*

Price shoots up so all the options are in the money. \*oops\*

options up to 320 strike are added

**Wednesday**

*European Market*

the price is getting really high  üöÄ

*Regular Trading Hours*

Watching the order flow is like watching a battle take place. They have algorithms that are being used to try to push the price down, and things rapidly get bought back up. It's like watching someone try to keep a beachball underwater. The hedgies call their news buddies at CNBC, they make us out to be an alt-right white supremist group (fuck that, we don't talk about politics!) they call us irresponsible, they try to scare the retail investor and then make everyone think a selloff is happening so a sell-off does occur.

Well what they don't understand is they've been fucking training these **DIAMOND HANDS** since before October and November. The paper hands have already sold to us, you're not going to find paper hands by employing the same tactics you've been using all along. But I guess you're all out of options..

Anyway, they can't get the price below the highest strikes of $320, which is really bad for them.

*Afterhours*

Price maintains at high levels above highest strike of 320. new strikes added up to 590 (*? unclear on exact strike here and too lazy to look it up*) 

**EDIT the highest strike here seems like it should be $450. (thanks u/LBGW_experiment) I don't know where I pulled $590 from, like I said - fan-fiction. And I am a huge fan of this stock**

**Thursday**

*European Market*

the price is getting really high  üöÄ You can bet the hedgies are watching it as closely as I am. Touching $450 there, crossing $500. it's low volume trading, but a strong indication of really positive sentiment. Well this is the day everything happened. And it makes sense, the hedgies REALLLLLLLY needed shares to cover all those calls that were in the money now.

*Regular Trading Hours*

How to do it, they think. So they twist everyone's arm and eventually figure they can scare off the retail investor by **BREAKING THE FREE MARKET**, allowing users to sell but not buy. C'mon...

The price is shooting up any way. The gamma squeeze of a century looks to be occurring, and it will trigger the short squeeze. Time to scare the retailer! BOOM circuit breaker after circuit breaker, people are rushing to outsell each other, and the bid is lowering to maintain a safely wide bid ask spread. **Very few shares are being exchanged**, but the price drops from about $450 to $125 in a span of about 35 mins. hedgies are selling short to each other and then selling the same shorts again a little lower to artificially drive the price down.

The plunge ultimately doesn't work to scare us, again bc   üíéü§≤ , but I suspect they were able to stop loss raid and people couldn't buy back in..

Overall, things are harder on Thursday, and we finish lower than Wed close.

*Afterhours*

I haven't gotten much sleep at this point, and I didn't watch AH very closely, so no comments here. Strikes up to 800 were added.

**Friday**

*European Market*

continued buying and strong price support. very strong sentiment.

*Regular Trading Hours*

So this is where the hedgies are really sweating. They've gone back to trying to keep the beachball below water and nothing is working. ""How did this not scare of the stupid peasant?"" they think to themselves and ask one another.

The last thing to consider, is that the MMs also made a lot of money on OTM options that expired Friday. They could use this to cover some of the losses from the options they sold earlier that 100x, BUT ONLY if they they were able to sell some options that expired OTM.

For this to happen is was **monumentally important** for them to defend the $350 price. I watched algorithmic precision carry out on the sell orders - it didn't look like there was much human selling (unless you are systematically opening up orders to drive the price down with low volume).

So now they've defended $350 hard all day, and they want to scoop up more profit from calls they sold at lower strikes. Thus begins a brilliant 2 hour long decline of carefully driving the price down. In my estimation, they are having a really hard time borrowing shares, and after that little stunt down to $125 on Thursday, they have to carefully allocate shares.

Well 11:00 comes around, and they realize that they're dangerously low on ammunition, so they get RH to buy back the contract from you **an hour before they normally would** an hour later many of those calls were worth 5x what you got, not to mention RH does a shitty fill. so you were fighting blatant and coordinated price manipulation and a shitty fill price.

And that's what happened to your options on Friday.

=================================

Happily, GameStop does have an ATM offering going. It put it in place on Dec. 8, 2020, when the stock was at about $16.35. The way these things work is that GameStop disclosed that its bank could sell stock‚Äîup to $100 million worth‚Äî‚Äúfrom time to time‚Äù at GameStop‚Äôs request ‚Äúconsistent with its normal trading and sales practices‚Äù; it did not disclose any particular schedule, and has not yet reported if any shares have been sold, or how many, or when. So I don‚Äôt know if GameStop had sold the whole $100 million before Friday‚Äôs wild run, or if it had any stock left over to sell; if it had any left over, I don‚Äôt know if it sold it all on Friday.

Learn about the tactics that have been and will be used on GME

Prime brokers, hedge funds, broker dealers, and the DTC are all in bed together with the help of their friends in media I.e CNBC, WSJ etc. 

These financial institutions allowed illegal short sales of counterfeit shares and they‚Äôre about to receive a reckoning the likes of which have never been seen before. 

Beware of dirty tactics such as short ladder attacks, media assaults, and pulling margin away from long customers etc. in the coming weeks. For example, a short ladder attack is where they‚Äôll tank the share price using counterfeit shares so the price you see is fake and not reflective of supply and demand, which will induce panic causing you to sell or so they hope. Similar to what we saw on Jan 28 when it moved from 450+ to 112. They want you to sell them your shares cheaply so they can get a free pass and unwind the mess they‚Äôve created. Don‚Äôt fall for it. They would never give you a free pass so what reason do you have to give them one? 

They will have to buy your shares to cover their shorts so just üíé ü§≤. **This level of short squeeze is unprecedented**. I don‚Äôt know how long it will take but it will happen. If you can, call your broker and request your shares not to be lent out. 

And if you haven‚Äôt seen this yet I highly recommend you watch this video where Cramer talks about how he manipulated the markets in 2006. At the time, the video was made for the internet and it ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt supposed to go out to tv‚Äù. Little did he know the internet would become bigger than tv. 

Look up Cramer and Aaron task interview manipulation on YouTube

$SCHW owns and operates both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab and has the most to gain from this Citadel/market manipulation fiasco.

**Breakdown of Restrictions by Brokerage: Worst to Best**

**RobinHood: (Worst)**

\- Trading restrictions limiting purchasing power to as little as 1-5 shares on over 50 stocks

[https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys)

\- Allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of GME and AMC during Thursday's trading rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\- Liquidity issues: RH is racing to raise 1$ billion from its existing investors as of Friday as many individuals are withdrawing their funds in protest of restrictions

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

**Interactive Brokers (garbage)**

\- Trading restrictions on GME/AMC/BB allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of these securities during Thursdays trading Rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\- CEO stated in CNBC interview they imposed restrictions to help out hedge funds (and stabilize the market)

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

[https://www.investopedia.com/robinhood-latest-broker-to-restrict-trading-of-gamestop-and-others-5100879](https://www.investopedia.com/robinhood-latest-broker-to-restrict-trading-of-gamestop-and-others-5100879)

**WeBull + ETrade (garbage)**

\- Trading restrictions on GME/AMC/BB allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of these securities during Thursdays trading Rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)

\-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\-Raised margin requirements on many securities

**Schwab/TD Ameritrade (reasonable)**

\- Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities

\- Limiting short selling on volatile tickers (limiting trades with unlimited risk)

\- Raised margin requirements on many securities

\- Allowed trading of volatile securities once cash deposits were verified (many new accounts experienced this issue as new funds were not settled)

Both of these restrictions are reasonable as they have unlimited risk and are not trying to be liable for any substantial losses

**Fidelity/Vanguard (Best)**

\- Raised margin requirements on many securities

\- Limiting short selling on volatile tickers (limiting trades with unlimited risk)

Both of these restrictions are reasonable as they have unlimited risk and are not trying to be liable for any substantial losses

Thousands of upset retail investors will be fleeing RH, IBRK, Webull and Etrade over the next couple of weeks. Switching to Fidelity and Schwab/TD Ameritrade.

I would also go long Fidelity investments but it is not publicly traded.

**Schwab Analysis**

**User Growth:**

The amount of brand new retail investors opening up accounts over the past week is ridiculous. GME + AMC + BB pump has been blasted across every media station. Every online brokerage was experience server lag and strain over the past week due to the increased volume from new retail investors. Traffic on these sites were 3-4 times what they normally were during the recent trading frenzy.

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/schwab-vanguard-fidelity-suffer-service-problems-amid-trading-surge-51611773909?siteid=yhoof2](https://www.barrons.com/articles/schwab-vanguard-fidelity-suffer-service-problems-amid-trading-surge-51611773909?siteid=yhoof2)

RH/Webull/Etrade/IBRK transfers - many retail investors will be transferring over their accounts as a result of the trade restrictions and collusion with hedge funds. Listed below are the total accounts at each brokerage

RH: 13 million accounts

Etrade: 5.2 million accounts

Webull: 2 million accounts

IBRK: 700k accounts

Even if only a small portion of users switch brokerages 5-10% we are still looking at 1-2 million new accounts up for grabs between TD/Schwab/Fidelity/Vanguard

More users = more deposits/commission = more profits = stonks go up

**Reputation -** RH/Webull/Etrade/IBRK have had their app ratings and reputation destroyed thanks to reviewing bombing as a result of market collusion. These low reviews will discourage any new retail investors from using their platforms and push them towards TD/Schwab/Fidelity.

**Discount:**

$SCHW is trading at a 17% discount (as of PM on Friday) from its January high all while new retail investors and user registrations and deposits reached an all time high over the past week. Negative media coverage and market sell off this week has caused every publicly traded brokerage company to sell of from their highs. With a market rebound and new user registration data for January this stock will fly past its ATH's and run into the 70's.

**Average Daily Users**

The average daily website users has seen almost a 20% increase from the October 2020 numbers to December 2020 alone. The January numbers will even be substantially higher with TD Ameritrade and Schwab both reporting network strain due to the influx of new investors signing up last week to get into GME/AMC/BB. This trend wont be stopping anytime soon, the retail investor's strength is gaining. Just look at Wallstreetbets alone we had 2.2 million members as of Monday and now we are sitting at 7 million.

**Upcoming Earnings**

$SCHW is going to crush their upcoming earnings for Q1 2021 in April. They acquired TD Ameritrade on October 6. The amount of new retail investors has exploded over the last couple of months. Just look at last years growth in new accounts most brokerages have seen a over 100% increase in 2020 traffic. Their next earnings report for Q1 2021 will be the first quarter with 3 full months of combined revenue from both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab. There will also be a mass exodus of upset traders fleeing Webull, Etrade and Robinhood by the thousands and transferring their assets into TD Ameritrade and Schwab.

**Future/Longevity of Brokerages:**

TD Ameritrade/Schwab will be one of the few brokerages not being slammed by class action lawsuits as a result of the manipulation today. E Trade, RobinHood, IBRK and Webull will have users fleeing in the masses to new brokerages. Do you really want to leave your money sitting on a brokerages that may have pending lawsuits against it and possible liquidity issues? (looking at you Robinhood)

**Price Target:** Bank of America just upgraded $SCHW on January 12 giving it a $68 target. Stating their has been mass growth in retail users. This was prior to the new user explosion the past 2 weeks. This stock will easily run to $70 once data comes out for January 2021 on the amount of new users and transfers.

**TLDR:** $SCHW will crush its Q1 2021 earnings thanks to an explosion in new retail investors as a result of the media coverage on GME and AMC. Retail traders on platforms that halted trading activity on Thursday will also be transferring their holdings to Schwab + TD Ameritrade. $SCHW is at a discount thanks to the market sell off and will rebound to $70+ once registration data comes out for January.

Position: 02/05/2021 & 02/12/2021 $57 Calls

Calls are dirt cheap as this stock is seen as a boomer stock with low volatility.

EDIT: A few people saying TD/Schw/Fidelity were no allowing GME/BB/AMC trading. This may be a result of your cash not settling. New accounts needed their funds to settle before trading these higher volatility tickers. Any errors popping up may also be due to server strain, I was using TD and RBC in Canada and had issues finding tickers/entering into positions

EDIT 2: Schwab will be giving its winter business update on Tuesday at 11am. I expect them to discuss the massive growth in retail investors which should help this stock bounce.

EDIT 3: talked to a online agent about transferring over investments into Schwab. He mentioned that there has been more transfer requests in the last couple days then all of last quarter causing wait times/rep times to go from 5 minutes on hold to over a hour on average."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092933.csv|StockTicker|['DD']|[]|['TD', '$SCHW', 'TD', 'GME', 'AMC', 'RH', 'GME', 'BB', 'CEO', 'CNBC', 'GME', 'BB', 'GME', 'TD', 'GME', 'RH', 'IBRK', 'TD', 'I', 'GME', 'AMC', 'BB', 'IBRK', 'IBRK', '$SCHW', 'PM', 'TD', 'BB', '$SCHW', 'TD', 'TD', 'TD', 'TD', 'E', 'IBRK', '$SCHW', '$SCHW', 'GME', 'AMC', 'TD', '$SCHW', 'A', 'AMC', 'I', 'TD', 'RBC', 'EDIT', 'I', 'EDIT']|['SCHW', 'GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'SCHW', 'SCHW', 'SCHW', 'SCHW', 'GME', 'AMC', 'SCHW', 'AMC']

Tendietime, memes, üöÄemojisü§ùüíé, whatever motivation you think you still need for tomorrow and the days after to just HOLD, **its actually much simpler.**

So mute your evening drawing class for a minute, chew your crayons to help you concentrate and focus on what im telling you.

We know:

**A) Shorts** [**bleed**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9dukq/its_working_melvin_capital_lost_53_in_january/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) **by holding short positions. Shorts desperately want to close positions.**

**B) To close, they have to buy stonks from us;** *saw a post earlier (help me find it?) saying we hold most of the shares.*

**C) If they buy, price goes up because we dictate the ask.**

so by easy, 2 braincell logic, whoever sells first, will automatically be the first to miss out on the tendies that follow.

Now idk about you guys, but my 3 braincells seem to only exist to make me think about what i missed out on,

>""why didnt i buy earlier"", ""why didnt i buy more"", ""why did i not take out a fucking loan"".

Im more okay with holding too long than too short

(fuck short anyways right?)

The essence is: what will you tell your 3 friends when they ask how much you made?

>""yea nah i sold at 600 haha, i know it went to 5000 but you know that old boomer who said you cant time the market haha? now lets go celebrate at wendys i'll let you guys choose anything you want from the dollar menu haha""

Dont be that guy

Now go back drooling at your art teachers cutout, delete your limit orders and when your artificial mistress Alexa wakes you up tomorrow with the generic ""I love you my lovely toilet-tiger"" and your old notification to sell on market open, tell her shes not real and ask if she allows you to stay in bed for 10 more minutes

TL;DR:

As soon as you sell, it drives the price up further because shorts have to cover and buy at our ask, therefore the sooner you sell, the more potential gains you will miss out on.

The board's objective is to make this a long-term win. It is not to either pump the price or burn the shorts. Burning the shorts is fun for them, but not their job. A significant cash infusion via capital raise (around $1 billion or so) would increase their positive outcomes a lot. There are a few ways to do this, but I think the best is a rights dividend/warrant offering where current shareholders get warrants. This would have some unpredictable effects on the stock and possibly cause some unpredictable short-term volatility, but would ultimately reduce volatility a lot..**

*Disclaimer: Not financial/investing/tax advice. I'm not a sell-side expert and don't have investment banking experience, but if any sell-side experts give me commentary on this thread I'll integrate and credit. I probably got some details wrong. I'm short-term bullish on this stock, but have a tiny long-term put position.*

Gamestop as a business would long-term benefit from more cash right now. They have 949m of long-term debt, and a bunch of leases they'd like to cancel (and severance payments they'd have to make with those store closures to laid off employees specific to those stores). They also would like to accelerate their development of more profitable businesses (such as eCommerce, any new ideas, and the rest). Extinguishing this debt completely, ditching bad stores, and investing in growth would all make sense to an extent, even if they turn around and issue new debt (at a much lower interest rate since their financial situation will be improved).

To do this, they need to raise capital. While they could use debt, I don't think that makes sense with equity at these values. Therefore, they will try equity if they do. The three approaches that make some sense (Also the three most frequent approaches) are to do a secondary offering (similar to an IPO, which is a primary offering), do an off-the-shelf offering (which they technically can already do $100m of), or do a rights distribution.

Additionally, GME will want to regain control of their stock. Tilray's founder commented on this recently, but basically, when the stock is like this, there are a lot of side effects  - more legal risks, any options or RSUs you issue employees stop being long-term motivating, a lot of early retirements as people cash out their options, and just a huge amount of press that is unrelated to your business goals. It's not actually good for the business to have a stock this volatile.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/tilray-ceo-brendan-kennedy-issues-a-warning-to-gamestop-amc-bosses.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/tilray-ceo-brendan-kennedy-issues-a-warning-to-gamestop-amc-bosses.html)

Here is some more detail of my non-professional understanding of these fundraising methods. I think a rights distribution is most likely.

**Secondary Listing:**

This would involve them bundling a bunch of institutions and offering new shares out, just like an IPO. The problem is that to do this, they have to offer at a discount. This will enrage current shareholders. This also will allow shorts to cover more or less immediately, which also will enrage the current shareholders. I think this one is bad press all around, and I think they'd have to offer a very large discount to get institutions comfortable with doing it given the daily volatility. They also open themselves up to lawsuits, because the price is very volatile, and if GME is, for example at $100 3 weeks from now, it's an instant lawsuit. by both current and new shareholders because the losses are so large. I think this is their worst option.

**Off The Shelf Listing:**

GME already has a $100m authorization for this. I suspect (but don't know) they already used it I believe there are some timing issues here, but this is the second best option. I think there are some timing delays on being able to use it, and there may still be some legal risks I'm unaware of. Optically, I think it looks not great because it will run contrary to the fervor gripping the stock right now and be seen as giving the shorts a bit of a lifeline.

**Public Rights Distribution:**

A write-up on this in general here:

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rightsoffering.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rightsoffering.asp)

I think this is their best option. In this, they would dividend out warrants to shareholders (this is an option, except you pay the company for the share and they make a new share, instead of someone having to sell you an existing share - so it dilutes. Usually this is done as 1 warrant per X shares. So for example, they might dividend out 1 warrant for every 5 shares held. They could then set a warrant exercise price that is low compared to the current price, but obviously not lawsuit bait, such as $20. Dividending out two warrants per 3 shares long at this price would likely result in full conversion right now, and raise them $1,000,000,000 roughly in cash.  Because these ONLY go to existing shareholders, it ends up not being dilutive in the same way other offerings are - everyone can preserve their share if they put capital in - does not punish longs. **Realistically though, they'll want to issue the fewest warrants possible at the highest price they can justify and avoid danger because the more warrants they issue, the more it increases the value of puts and can create unintended consequences.**

The way this would play out is that they'd first announce the rights distribution, probably a few days to a week before. This will result in some interesting market dynamics that I'll describe in a moment.

Then, you'd get the rights distribution as a GME long. As a GME short, you'd have to SERVE UP THE RIGHTS DISTRIBUTION to the long you borrowed shares from.  Because there are a lot more longs than shares, this would have some chaos, which the market makers would have to sort out.

Then, there would be a short time during which people have to elect to exercise the warrant, which you'd be able to do through your broker They'll want this as short as possible so that the price doesn't fall below the warrant price.

Then, they clear all the warrants, and a day or two later, deliver all the shares to people.

This is their best approach I think because it gets them capital without being pain to existing longs, while also reducing their lawsuit risk compared to the others because they are just distributing a right at a low price to existing longs on equal footing, who are the ones who have standing to sue them in the first place.

I don't know how the laws would work on insiders - I think they can exercise these, but I'm sure there are a lot of details on the timing of it. They probably need to do it well ahead of q4 earnings lockup to be clean.

**Rights Market Dynamics:**

I find this very hard to predict, but this would have a few effects.

1. Upon the warrants/rights being granted (NOT declared), stock will fall in price significantly, but longs shouldn't actually lose money because they also were granted warrants. In theory, warrant value + stock value for a given number of shares (plus their granted warrants) should be the same as the prior stock price. In other words, I don't really see it as bearish or bullish.
2. You would not want to be long call options through this. Very ITM calls and calls that expire before the distribution would be largely and completely unaffected respectively, but OTM longer dated calls would get destroyed the moment this is announced. If you do have an ITM call, you will want to get out of it before the distribution by either exercising to get shares, or selling it. If you sell and are still bullish, you can then go and buy shares. Would not recommend trying to buy OTM calls after this repricing, though I guess you could.
3. Puts are the reverse. Puts that are shorter dated than the distribution don't change. Puts that are longer dated go up in price a lot even though the total value of the company didn't change.
4. You could be short through this, but it's a little annoying. Most likely, you'll be marked short the warrant, so the warrant share structure will kind of mirror the current long structure, but this has to be closed out before the exercise date, so warrants will all get called in at some point. **In a sense, it's forcing shorts to cover a good portion of their short** since the warrant will arbitrage such that the warrants granted + stocks originally held = same value as the stock alone was before. They'd have to get the cash to buy warrants on the market to deliver to people you borrowed from. Likely a bit of a mess. Would cause some short covering, alongside that call selling. Would this be more buying or selling? I don't know, the stock is super levered. I don't think it would matter a lot initially though.
5. After the distribution happens, the stock should reduce volatility after the initial price renormalization of warrants distributed + original stock = same market cap (but stock price down). This will be more the case after shares delivered. The reason the volatility reduces is that this will reduce the leverage in the stock - calls on one side, short on the other. It also eliminates the bankruptcy thesis that shorts were in on in the first place.
6. GME would regain control of their stock and be set up for a faster turn-around.

The only downside of this is it's a bit less intuitive and will require significant explaining to people. But I think it's the most fair to existing shareholders, causes the least legal risk, and puts the company in an excellent position to do their turn-around.

What I'm uncertain on is if there are weird gamma squeeze dynamics from the share price being implied to be lower after a distribution. They may want to distribute more modestly than I'm suggesting for this reason.

**Other Unknowns:**

I don't know what restrictions are on how many warrants they can toss out and if shareholder votes are required. It seems to me it's close to a stock split, so maybe none? Any investment bankers have thoughts on this - minimum price they can offer a warrant if equal distribution to all shareholders? Maximum dilution? In situations where they have to issue warrants at or above current price, this obviously would not work at all. My sense is they can be at a discount, and can dilute, but may have maximums. Anyone able to confirm who is an expert?

**Timing**

My understanding which may be incorrect is they can‚Äôt do this before earnings. Their fiscal year I think ends this week? So they‚Äôd have to hurry to do this. Would not be surprised at an early earnings in order to facilitate. Early earnings is a tell that capital raise incoming."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092954.csv|StockTicker|['GME', 'I']|['GME']|['A', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'IPO', 'GME', 'I', 'IPO', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'I', 'X', 'ONLY', 'GME', 'GME', 'SERVE', 'UP', 'THE', 'IGHTS', 'UTION', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'NOT', 'I', 'ITM', 'OTM', 'ITM', 'OTM', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

You're not wrong, but theres some major issues.

It's a 1.5 Trillion dollar market cap. There is a hard case for the WSB, if acting in collusion which it shouldn't, cause that's naughty, to move silver.

Citadel, et al own a real stake in silver. Maybe deal with one issue at a time.  They would be enriched by this play, which effectively undoes doing them dirty.  Do you really wanna give them a reach around while you're savaging their red little asses?

Think about who owns the physical good.  This would cause physical silver to rocket, enriching some pretty nasty despots (both political and financial). None of this exists in a vacuum.

Every time someone has tried to mess with the silver market at scale it's blown up in their faces. Especially the Hunt brothers (Silver Thursday in 1980).  They literally lost their billion dollar family fortune in the mid 80's (from the stuff stemming from 1980)

Precious metals are a far more liquid market, with far greater trading times, and more world markets effecting price.  This means there are more players.  WSB was the David in the GME story, and won't register on the Silver market. You have COMEX & LBMA.

JPM is one of the big Market Makers.  Citadel et al aren't even a blip compared to JPM.

I'm saying it's not even bringing a knife to a gun fight.  It's bringing a rubber band gun to a nuclear arms meeting.

These MF's are gonna eat all your tendies for an appetizer and want more.

Let's talk about the theory behind using magic lines; Momentum in stocks can be somewhat predictable, and 'Elliot Wave Theory' depicts just that (Figuring out what a reasonable Price target to set and how long these rallies can push for is more complex and we wont talk about it.) 

Follow along as you look below: Stonks go, ""Up, dip, up, dip, up"" before going ""dump, bump, dump."" 

![img](1ddqqikagpe61 ""Think of these depicted trends as - Swingable trades / Multi-week / Long term.        
 (When we are looking at GME charts below, imagine the charts are Starting right after the 'support' was found at the number '13' on the Long term trendline.)"")

&#x200B;

How do we relate this to GME? Bullishly, I would say we are about to enter the last 'impulse wave' (Top trend line in the picture above,) and that price movement on Monday/Tuesday this week will say a lot about how drastically this squeeze will truly be pushed upwards. (Rising wedge depicted below)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[If there is a dip into the 300-320 range in P-M, I would load there; if below $300 is broken, beware, as it very well may act as a neckline break of a H&S formation. With that said, I love that volume that can be seen picking up late Friday; another bullish look.](https://preview.redd.it/d6xbmnkoipe61.png?width=1518&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b68b8faa4bf6a3342ca6910331053e24411324e)

&#x200B;

Now, I'm not in love with the wave cycle above  and that we appear to be on relative to the Long term stages of this movement to be completely honest, and after including the PM/AH price movements... It appears that on Thursday morning GME had started the first move in it's final impulse wave higher to find the peak; Meaning, the *squeeze was very likely to be squoze* going into into Thursday's Open Market had retail not been almost totally restricted from buying.

 (See chart Below; (5) would've been 'peak' - perhaps around 1k/share.)

[Think of it this way - without restricting buying, retail would've bought the PM\/opening dips like crazy, solidifying the first impulse wave & sending us off into another Gamma Squeeze\/Short-Squeeze combo. This was already AFTER the drop in the general markets on Wednesday, what I suspect to have been a result of big-boys liquidating longs.](https://preview.redd.it/e7ng28xsjpe61.png?width=1518&format=png&auto=webp&s=704cd948d59d85cf149eba94ba49a60f1cfc6c0f)

Finally, a bit of AMC analysis.... Here we see a similar story to GME, appearing to be within a rising wedge, ready to start its next impulse wave upwards. 3-6 mo PT of $28

**1. What's happening with GME?**

The GME play is a very simple problem of supply and demand. Without having to explain what shorting is, just know that as long as short interest is over 100% the following applies:

- There are 100 sellers of GME
- There are 200 buyers of GME

We (retail/shareholders) represent 100 of the buyers above, the other 100 buyers represent hedge funds. The difference being that we already bought, hedge funds are still on the hook. 

Now, because of this, hedge funds want to buy for as low a price as possible and every day that they don't, they are paying Billions in interest. This tips the tables in our favour since we don't have to pay any interest for not selling. 

In a nutshell, if we don't sell, the price of GME can, theoriticaly, go to infinity.

**2. How can you participate?**

All you need to do is buy $GME with YOUR cash. On Thursday we saw what happens if you buy shares with the enemy's money (margin), they short attack to push the price lower and sell your shares via a margin call. If you have a reputable broker you can also disable lending of your shares to further limit the supply.

**3. What stage are we in?**

If you've seen The Big Short, we are in the stage where everyone realises the system is corrupt and the banks are scrambling to find a way to profit and not go bankrupt.

In this movie you are the ones betting that the housing market will go down and the hedge funds are the banks. The brokers (which disallowed buying of GME) are the rating agencies. 

**4. Is it safe to make this bet?**

In a non-corrupt free market buying GME while short interest is over 100% is a free money glitch. You're basically betting against corruption at this point in time.

History has shown corruption is rampant so do not bet more than you're willing to lose. Think of it as a donation against corruption that might get you a lot of money if you win.

**5. Is this what wallstreetbets is about?**

No, WSB is about taking risks and treating the market as a casino via the purchasing of derivatives (option contracts) in speculative plays. This is the first time in WSB history that buying shares is being advocated.

**6. Is this financial advice?**

No, I just really like the stock.

I think I may have averaged about 3 hours of sleep per night, digging around the internet/twitter, following new developments, and trying my best to recognize what is actually happening here.

Millennials and relevant generations were set up for failure from the very beginning. Not only did the DotCom bubble hurt the parents of young millennials, also affecting them, but the ‚Äò08 crash totally wiped out pensions and retirement accounts, sending most all the way back to square one.

During the ‚Äò08 crash, many billionaires (who were already in the 1%) were made while the average person suffered. Since then, media coverage, guidance, and other forms of communication were heavily pushed out to the average investor to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù them get back on track, while hedge funds and deep money in Wall Street were really commanding the ship.

What I‚Äôve noticed these past few weeks is a rebellion from those suppressed (common man/woman) in the form of heavy concentration on a few securities. GME, BB, NOK, AMC and others are all we ü¶ç focused on while the rest of the market was ignored. 

Futures didn‚Äôt mean shit on Friday, as GME closed ~135 points higher than it did Thursday. While this happened, shorts doubled down on the other meme stocks while limit buying ability was forced on a few brokerages. Cowardly illegal attack. However, what I saw was the mass waking up and ignoring the media, technical patterns, futures, and others means of manipulation used by Wall Street to create an emotional response within the common man. We are no longer paying attention to the tools Wall Street uses to drive the ship. In fact, us ignoring those manipulative ‚Äúindicators‚Äù only makes our autistic power even stronger. 

This week, I am giving you homework. Your homework is to continue to COMPLETELY ignore the media, futures, social media posts, etc. Who the fuck cares if futures are down 10,000 points? That indicator only
matters if you‚Äôre a üìÑü§öpig and sell your positions. We do not invest with emotion or paper hands anymore. WE decide what the stocks are worth and WE have each other‚Äôs backs, unlike the government who has handed out pennies to us on our taxed dollars.

Stick to your plan and hold with üíéüôå. If someone else sells, i‚Äôll still be holding for the next person to jump in and have a chance for battle.

Many of us are probably watching the short interest % of float to indicate when the short squeeze is squoze. At this point, the hedge funds clearly know this, given how hard they've spent the last couple days using their MSM shills to announce ""WE HAVE EXITED OUR SHORT POSITIONS!!! YOU WIN!""

There is a chance we're going to see that short interest % of float number go down at the same time as the price drops. Failure-to-delivers may also go down, at least in appearance.

# This is probably a lie.

Failure-to-deliver numbers and the short interest % are just the tip of the giant dildo they're trying to fuck us with. If this thing is actually what it looks like, they have way, way, *way* more exposure to this shitstorm than they are letting on.

There are ways for hedge funds and their colluding market makers to hide their exposure to a counterfeit stock scheme / naked short / short attack. You can read all about it here: [counterfeiting stock 2.0](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) (again, credit to johnny for bringing this to our attention)

If you don't know how to read, just scroll down to the picture of the iceberg.

If you **do** know how to read but don't have a lot of time, still scroll down to the picture of the iceberg, and start reading from there.

**TL: DR**\-- using a bag of dirty tricks, hedge funds can ""unwind"" their *disclosed* short positions, without ever having to exit their *real* short positions-- the ones that are actually super dangerous and putting them at risk of insolvency. They are going to do everything they can to get us to sell, **up to and including fucking with the disclosed short interest % of float-- the number we're all watching.**

So watch the short interest with a titanic-sized grain of salt. It could go up, it could go down, but it's likely not anywhere close to their real risk exposure either way.

My GME positions:  4 @ 329, 2 @ 325, 13 @ 272.

I originally bought in at $14 and sold at $19 like a paper-handed bitch.Now I'm holding until $10,000.

*I'm an ape, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, this is not financial advice, do your own research, etc.*

**EDIT:** if you have a lot of time on your hands and want some more research on how this works and maybe a little peek into what we're in for, see u/Sleavitt10's comment [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9jbc5/listen_to_me_we_cannot_trust_the_short_interest/glib7cs/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

**EDIT 2:** people are pointing out that that source I‚Äôm using says short squeezes aren‚Äôt really possible anymore, because counterfeiting can overcome any amount of buy-side pressure. And normally I would agree, but there are exceptions.

Like when a counterfeiting scheme runs into a multi-million-man army of enraged retail investors who are willing to buy the stock at any price, for example. And remember, the longer this goes on, the more they lose, so they are highly motivated to produce a quick resolution. The desperate moves on Thursday and Friday that ultimately failed are proof of what a serious situation this is becoming for them.

The sheer number of retail investors who are buying this stock just to fuck up the short attack is absolutely mind boggling. So long as we maintain our numbers and resolve, they must spend more and more money to get out of the hole.

Hold. The. Line.

**EDIT 3:** [IT'S ALREADY FUCKING HAPPENING.](https://twitter.com/jonpeterswrites/status/1356019766624923654) 6 hours ago shorts weren't covering, and suddenly they've covered 30 mil on 50 mil volume? I don't fucking THINK so. And even if they are, that doesn't unwind the 2-3x as many shorts built on top of imaginary shares.

There have been a number of posts lately regarding this, and on Friday I also fell victim to Robinhood locking up my cash and preventing me withdrawing to my bank.

I highly recommend everyone to take daily screenshots of their account until you have transferred to a different brokerage or closed all positions and cashed out.

I would also highly recommend doing this on a computer if possible, so that you can make sure all relevant information, including the name on the account, every stock/option you are currently holding, the total account value, and the date/time are all visible within a single image.

This may be the only way to protect yourself in the case that RH faces a liquidity crisis and takes all of your hard earned tendies. RH is insured up to $500,000, with up to $250,000 being cash.

Also, $GME to the moon, diamond hands, and all that other jazz

EDIT: Because I just realized this, I also recommending downloading a statement, and overlaying it over the RH portfolio on your browser, so that you can also capture the account number and name. 2-factor authentication will go a long way if you end up filing an insurance claim when RH goes bankrupt.

EDIT 2: Many are suggesting screen recording apps for active trading during market hours. I will 100% be using such software and I stand by these posters and suggest everyone else uses these screen capture applications. I have seen AZ Screen Recorder recommended. If anyone has other suggestions, post a comment and I will add them to the list.

So far so good.

The problem with SLV is that silver IS NOT A CENTRALIZED MARKET!

The biggest silver market is COMEX, which is a futures market. See, futures markets aren't the same thing as single stock markets, they are much bigger, have more institutions rather than retail investors and they are much more complicated.

When a typical retard buys gme, they hit buy market and that's it, they now have 1 share. 

In futures, it's different. You buy contracts, these contracts are standardized and the most popular contract for silver is : SI . SI has a contract size of 5000 troy ounces!! One contract is equal to  135000 $ worth of silver. You don't need to pay 135k for a contract, you can buy it for 14k if you close the position before you need to take delivery of the silver.

Some of you might have 14k, but the risk is very high: if silver moves down 1 dollar you lose 5k.

Another problem in the silver market are the participants: goverments own silver, hedge funds own silver, investment funds own silver, too many people own too much silver!! Gamestop is at about 30 billion dollars marketcap ( and that's now ). 

The open interest on the latest SI contract is 135 960, giving it an open interest value (which admitedly is not marketcap) of 18.354.600.000 usd. 18 billion usd in just open interest. 

Open interest is how many positions are open at any given time.

Silver is a much bigger market, with more big players.

GME - there weren't so many hedge funds (poor Melvin, that was the one big hedge fund shorting gme) and so it was a subreddit against a fund, and we won.

Silver is a different story - JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi, hedge funds, governments, a lot more money is in silver than gme.

For these reasons, don't go into SLV, you will just play where the big boys want you to play, they have the advantage there.

tl;dr : Silver won't moon, banks have advantage, hold gme to 10k."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092919.csv|StockTicker|['SLV']|[]|['SLV', 'IS', 'NOT', 'A', 'LIZED', 'ARKET', 'COMEX', 'SI', 'SI', 'SI', 'GME', 'JP', 'SLV']|['GME']

Before breaking down why this is important, let's quickly recap some of the highlights of last week:

GameStop had one of its first big pops to open the market Wednesday and remained volatile all day. Thursday, it opened with another significant pop, and then HFs employed some perfectly timed and very illegal market manipulation tactics. Some of the largest brokerages with the most retail investors blocked the purchase of GME shares, and only allowed the current investors to sell the stock. HFs coupled this restriction in free trade with what is commonly referred to as a short ladder attack, which is another form of market manipulation to fabricate the illusion that a stock is plummeting. Newly invested retail traders watched this play-out over the course of the day, and with only the option to sell and seeing their initial investment plummet quickly probably sold the shares, freeing them for Hedge Funds to scoop up. 

Friday morning opened with another pop and the SEC issued a statement that they will be closely monitoring the price volatility of certain stocks, which put HFs on notice, and publicly acknowledged that they are paying attention to the situation. Meanwhile, trade across many of the brokerages that had previously blocked their customers from buying reopened the option to buy, but with significant restrictions. 

üñêüíé**TL;DR RE: LAST WEEK üíéüñê**

Starting Wednesday, GME opened everyday with a big pop likely due to the fever pitch of news and interest combined with HFs slowly covering their positions. Tomfoolery was rampant as HFs tried to tamp down a potentially imminent squeeze. 

üñêüíé**SELL LIMIT ORDERS üíéüñê**

Okay, so why are sell limit orders so important this coming week? Or many of you may even be asking WHAT IS a sell limit order? To borrow a very succinct analogy: if you are an ü¶ç holding a üçå, the sell limit order is the number you tell your brokerage you're willing to sell your üçåfor. This number can be seen by the market, and the HFs can see these numbers, but more importantly, they can see ALL of them. This is key because depending on how long you've been tracking GME on WSB, you have likely seen several comments saying something along the lines of ""$420.69 IS NOT A MEME"" and it has continually increased from 1k, 5k, 10k, etc. Which is where we get to the meat of this post because if everyone sets the sell limit orders to these memeable numbers, the HFs can see these massive clusters of sell orders and WILL buy them, which will trigger massive drops in share price, and in turn likely cause panic selling much like we saw during the short ladder attack on Thursday. So what next?

**I DONT FUCKING KNOW CAUSE I AM NOT OFFERING FINANCIAL ADVICE, ONLY KNOWLEDGE AS UNDERSTOOD BY ME**

But here's the thing: these particular HFs have turned the market into a game, and a very select few badasses noticed this early on, and then started playing. After much due diligence by the thousands of redditors on this sub, more and more people learned the rules, saw an opportunity, and bought shares of GameStop because they like the stock. These HFs are now counting on all of us retail investors, especially those who are playing on hard mode and don't understand the market, to cut and run and give them an out. 

üñêüíé**TL;DRüíéüñê**

These particular hedge funds have turned the market into a game. They used cheat codes all last week, and are literally banking on newer retail investors who are playing on hard mode to lose and give them an easy out. Educate yourself as much as possible on the rules and make your own personal informed decision on if you want to set sell limit orders and what that number should be. 

Again, this is not financial advice and I truly am a dummy. I've just been lucky enough to use my nephew's iPad to educate myself whenever he gets distracted, which is usually only during lunch time because Patrick loves tendies. And finally:

Nokia is one of the largest telecommunication companies in the world, as well as one of the front running companies for 5G.  Nokia now has a significant hold in all of the world‚Äôs early 5G adopters. Including deals with the top four communication service providers in the United States as well as the top three providers in Japan and Korea. Multinational contracts and deals have placed Nokia at the top when it comes to 5G and it will only be getting bigger when 5G is more accessible to people like us. Last week we ran Nokia up to almost 9 dollars before multiple halts stopped all the momentum. Then the trading restrictions on Robinhood and other brokerages hurt the momentum even more. I believe this was to help the hedge funds cover there ass before the inevitable movement up were going to have in the future. With trade restrictions being lifted on most platforms and earnings coming on Thursday we should see a big move up. This is a value company, with huge room for growth. The hedge funds manipulated this hard dropping from 6 to 4.60. We will not let them win and short another great company into the ground. Nokia is one of the most undervalued stocks on the market. The more we go up the more hedge funds will try and short. Buy shares and hold for a long time. This is a great company.

After some adventures with Ol' Yeller, I was up some 30% that could finance an entire charcuterie instead of ramen. It was a blast, and I was ready to YOLO my cheese and my crackers into the sky. Enter $NVAX, with late stage trials that would dominate a deadly baby flu. You see, I had a whole $260, an A in an undergrad portfolio class, and knew nothing about vaccines; it literally could not go tits up. A few days later, as biotech do, my cheese was cut and a thing of dreams.

After my cheese portfolio tanked, I though maybe the smart money was on to something. My YOLO didn't take me to the moon, but mooned me instead. Naturally, I joined the dark side. Closed my position, went to grad school, helped write textbooks, taught analysts, and went full corpro.

But see, working for the man is not the same as being the man. It took my time, it stressed me away from my high school sweetheart, and it wasn't going to pay enough for studying full time again. Mid pandemic, I said fuck it to my own fundamentals, and YOLO'd on myself by quitting. Though I can't have my time, girlfriend, or education money anyway now, I don't regret it for a minute.

I know that this is the way because you tendie trackers and the markets confirmed it. You took GME to the moon, penetrating billionaire portfolios. Ol' Yeller is back, now queen of the Treasury. And most poetically of all? $NVAX went to the moon just last Friday. Even though I didn't get to ride these rockets, I did learn a lesson: don't let your memes settle as dreams.*

This has escalated faster than my dick when DFV posts, While pretty much everyone who bought into GME sub 20 knew there were massive tendies to be made, not single person in this entire scenario expected it to play out like this.  


Lets take a step back and review the FACTS, amidst the bot attacks, fake news, and overall noise coming from the powers at be.

1. **Gamestops long term prospects look good: marketing, $$$ and more $$$**

fundamentals are what we care about as the business needs to go through a paradigm shift in its model, thankfully, it has. We can all thank new daddy cohen for making this happen by investing in the long term strategy for revamping a business that was on its way out. He involved himself on the board, brought in his former chewy associates, and is making bigly moves to start setting up their pivot. Gamestop would naturally start to increase as speculators saw serious financial backing from an independent investor with an alignment between management and shareholders starting to form. Obviously when board members and c-suits are shareholders they have vested interest in the performance of the company, if you go and [read wikipedia on gme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop) you will see that they did not have any shareholders in upper level management, until 2019 which helped create the situation we are in, if the people running the company do not care about the value of it, they have no concern to prevent the value from being destroyed. So yay, management now gives a fuck. we have our first ingredient, ***aligned $$$***

Now on to the second ingredient, big $$$

Gamestop has to finance its operations for 2019 and 2020 as it went deep into the red, the lack of free cash flow and poor sales prospects drilled their credit rating to emerging market status, and set them up to fail if they could not find profits again, which with shit management is to be expected. With the new interest from stakeholders, GME took off, gaining market cap, and opening up a new avenue of financing. Even if GME hit a modest market cap of lets say 6.5bb, they would have been able to raise money without diluting the float by much. But now with a market cap approaching 20+bb its becoming absurdly easy for them to raise capital, hell even raising a cool billion becomes viable now via a secondary offering.   Gamestop has become a self fulfilling prophecy as of no amount of shorting can sustain a low value for the stock, so they have a solid avenue to raise more cash. Which in turn means they can pay off their debt, increase their credit rating, and what do you know all of the sudden they can become profitable again.   


third ingredient: attention and faith.

self explanatory, the whole hedge fund situation has brought more media attention to gamestop than any other form of marketing, now literally everyone and their mother will know about GME forever and a lot of people who used to engage with the brand are now flocking back. Now combine that with the faith that new daddy cohen has inspired you have a recipe for MASSIVE TENDIES

&#x200B;

now when we combine, aligned monetary interests, with new financing capability, huge investor confidence on management AND brand awareness. well fuck me thats one hell of a grand slam. 

with these few ingredients GME can cook up so many tendies, we already know they are working on making PC gaming more mainstream, and with all the renewed interest they can definitely pivot to some more interesting revenue streams, think the nintendo center in NYC for the heads who know, gamestops could become these social venues where gamers meet up and play together, or maybe hangout and have a beer. adult gaming and entertainment is actually taking off with the millennials and I expected it to be a serious path forward for gamestop. maybe not exactly like a video game bar, but some form of live social-gaming experience is something that I think is highly likely they will integrate. 

2. The financial institutions have their back against the wall, nothing can save them other than a gov bailout, its really a matter of closing the loss on the way down.

There is no fucking way on this planet that these shorters walk away from this in one piece, i do not think they will become insolvent because you know, wall street, but there is no way they do not take heavy losses. The sheer grit from new comers, lurkers, big names, and OGs is unspeakable. people have taken this scenario personally and people are just throwing money at this simply to say, BEARS R FUKT HEDGIES EAT COCK, which is not something this hedge fuckers could have seen coming. They have an innate arrogance that prevents them from considering such things. They know how much money they control, how to influence the right people, and their all homies with the important people so why should they care about the little guy when they can bend us over and fuck us whenever they want? well jokes on them cuz my wife's boyfriend already went to pound town and my ass can handle the pain. And guess what? SO CAN EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS GAME NOW, people are just buying, buying, and then buying some more, no matter the financial hurt, the buy side pressure has not and will not degrade(maybe when we hit 500+ a share since a lot of people might get priced out then) but it is a losing battle for them as every retail buy takes another share off the market. So they are in a pretty pickle. the longer they wait us out, the fewer shares they have to work with. The higher the price the more they bleed, the more they short, the worse it gets. Basically the longer they wait the more fucked they are, so HOLD because they will be trying everything we have seen this past week on us to get us to sell, become distracted, create FUD, prevent us from buying, restrict options, you name it. 

&#x200B;

All we need are these two points and you can start to see how there is literally no way out for these guys, the challenge, the real challenge ( that gives us our diamond hands) is waiting. yes PATIENCE, as buffet has once said, "" The stock market is a device to transfer money from the impatient to the patient"". WE ARE THE PATIENT, WE ARE STRONG TOGETHER, WE ARE THE FUCKING PLAYERS. And the hedgies know it. they are the impatient ones as each day they lose money, and each day they have to ***work*** to remain afloat. Every single person on this sub does not need to do shit other than buy GME when you see it at a price you like and never sell until the shorts have bled all their capital. 

&#x200B;

TLDR; GameStop has all the ingredients to generate, real long term value for their shareholders, be patient. The shorts have already lost, its a matter of how much now, be patient, the hedgies have to work everyday to figure out how to unfuck themselves, while we just has to scroll WSB and find confirmation bias DD like this one. pretty simple, be patient, watch shorts cry, make unlimited tendies. DO NOT LET ANYONE INFLUENCE YOUR DECISION ON WHETHER TO BUY OR SELL GME, MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS AND STAND BY THEM. I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL, THESE ARE MY OPINIONS, NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE

Obligatory: I'm long a single share of GME, am not very smart, and you shouldn't take financial advice from anyone in this sub.
This is opinion only in nature and i aim only to discuss possibilities and their outcomes.

Tldr at bottom:

Okay, WSB is simply a very large pool of investors who are concerned for the capital of short sellers investors. We all individually decided that these HF's took on infinite risk vs reward and that its problematic and scary.

We have encouraged each other to hold our positions so that HF's lose money and stop taking on trades that can cause serious economic turmoil.

So here's the skinny: No one is margin calling these guys, and they aren't dying from the interest yet. They are holding.

But what if their capital left?
The questions needed to be answered are

1.) ""what HF's are actively short GME, AMC, ETC. ""

2.) Who do they manage funds for ( is it 100% millionaire entrepreneurs or is it teachers pensions, police pension funds and the like).

3.) Do THEIR investors understand that these HF's risked taking their investments to zero and actually bringing the HF into the negative?

4.) Can retail {legally} , an independent collective concerned for above mentioned pensions have a (or many) reputable securities lawyer reach out to Hf's clients and be sure they are aware of the immenent risks?

I'm going to guess that most people aren't aware that their investment fund is risking 100% of their money going out the window. Probably think its all in goog, aapl, and fb. 

It's not retail investors fault that they took on infinite risk and things didn't go their way. But retail may be able to burn the shorts and not the pensions managed by them all at the same time.

Poke holes in my theory, brain is smooth like a bowling ball, small computations only.

Edit: to those calling me a bot, or saying im doing HF's bidding. This isn't a sob story narrative, no one should feel bad about pensions as collateral damage except the Hf's who took on infinite risk. The only interest in who's assets under management they have is to tell them their investment with HF might blow up and maybe they take their capital out, choking HF's solvency out. 

Tldr: could wsb retain a securities lawyer (s) to help HF investors / e.g. pension managers understand the true risks of their GME, AMC etc short positions. Possibly rug pulling short sellers capital for a checkmate.

# GameStop Short Nightmare Shows Few Signs of Becoming a Contagion

[GameStop Corp.‚Äôs](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GME:US) surge has struck fear into anyone caught on the wrong side of its ascent. But those **bearish positions probably aren‚Äôt big enough to lay low the larger universe of investment funds**.

That‚Äôs the view of Barclays Plc strategists led by Maneesh Deshpande. By plotting the value of bearish equity bets versus the whole market‚Äôs capitalization, they found that short sales have actually dwindled during the past year to the lowest level since at least 2008. Moreover, those **most-heavily shorted companies targeted by day traders this year had bearish wagers amounting to less than 0.001% of the $43 trillion market.**

Whether losses being suffered by hedge funds and other money pools will be large enough to ignite a full-blown contagion was a concern that arose several times during last week‚Äôs selling -- the worst in the S&P 500 since October. For now, while Reddit-fueled stock jocks may have drowned out every other narrative, they‚Äôre unlikely to completely subsume the bull market.

 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre witnessing a nearly unprecedented amount of speculative activity. But on the other hand, **we are talking about a very narrow group of stocks that don‚Äôt have an outsize influence**,‚Äù said Marshall Front, chief investment officer at Front Barnett Associates. ‚Äú**The underlying fundamentals of the economy are strong. A very aggressive and accommodative policy by the Federal Reserve is still intact. Together, they help the stock market on the way up**.‚Äù

Burned by short sales going against them, hedge funds have yanked money from the market at one of the fastest rates on record. The most-shorted stocks rallied 14% last week as a group, dealing the biggest blow to short sellers since last April, a [Goldman Sachs Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US) basket shows.

While the **S&P 500 dropped more than 3% last week, traders described the broad market as orderly**. To JPMorgan Chase & Co.‚Äôs strategists including Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, the retreat is likely a ‚Äúshort-lived technical tumble.‚Äù With earnings improving and U.S. consumers strengthening, this pullback is another opportunity to add stocks, particularly those geared toward an economic recovery, the strategists wrote in a Friday note.

 To be sure, day traders are targeting companies favored by bearish investors, trying to spur squeezes. In 2021, the top quintile of the Russell 3000 stocks with the highest short sales as a percentage of their float is up 20%, compared with a loss of 0.8% for the bottom 600, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But those returns are also consistent with a contour that was already taking shape as investor risk appetite increased: gains in companies with shakier finances, which had trailed during 2020‚Äôs pandemic market.

‚ÄúAlthough the short squeeze started with GME, it appears to be spreading to a wider range of stocks,‚Äù Deshpande at Barclays wrote in a note Friday, referring to GameStop‚Äôs ticker. ‚ÄúWhile we expect some more deleveraging, ultimately the scale of the problem appears quite limited.‚Äù

By Barclays‚Äôs tally, **short sales totaled $800 billion, or roughly 2% of the total market value of American equities, a sign that short sellers have not extended themselves**.

Wait until after you are done holding GME, even though you are planning to hold GME forever.

Anything other than GME is a distraction. Since you are holding GME forever, you are never allowed to invest in anything else ever again. Holding GME is your life's work and requires your undivided attention. There is no possible way anyone would ever talk about anything other than GME unless they wanted you to sell GME. Even when it's a weekend and you can't sell GME anyway.

All of your money should be in your brokerage so you shouldn't even have any money available to buy bullion with. Your brokerage would never betray you. 

Don't think anything of the fact that online bullion dealers have frozen your ability to buy silver. The statements on their front pages saying they have to restrict your purchase ability due to unprecedented market conditions are nothing like any other statements you've seen from anyone recently. Don't think about it. 

The US dollar will never lose value again. Biden is going to make an announcement tomorrow that the federal reserve will burn a pile of money to reverse inflation, I can feel it. Hedging against this is something you would only do if you're shilling for a hedge fund. That's why they're called hedgies. 

Pay no attention to the mass downvotes and accusations of shilling to everyone suggesting silver. The ruling class would never seed a meme about silver being a distraction to divide the community from adding another major step to their plan.

Pay no attention to how major banks have sold 200x more silver than they actually have and if they're called to deliver on all those receipts instead of people continuing to be happy to just hold paper receipts they could *hypothetically* exchange, then... well, like I said, no matter.

The important thing is to spend your weekend wondering what will happen to GME while there is no action you can take on it. Don't focus on anything you could take action right now.

Don't sort comments by new. You don't want to see the unfiltered stream of consciousness of the subreddit, just stick to the carefully curated, vote-and-award-manipulated ranking of what everyone can agree on. We don't have any stickied threads sorted by new today because the people in charge here have your best interests at heart and they don't want you to get into trouble buying any silver. They're not like that other guy who tried to sell out the community, shame on him. Since they're not sellouts, there's no way they could ever make a mistake or allow the community to be misguided. Trust in them and blindly follow the subreddit's general direction at all times.

And most importantly, don't forget, you're very small. Silver has a market cap of $1.4 trillion. Big banks and governments have a vested interest in it. Don't you dare think your little wallets could possibly tip the scales of something this big going on right in front of you. Just take your tendies and quit while you're ahead, and don't think too much about where this is all leading next.

EDIT - We've got a usual stickied thread sorted by new, thanks mods!

*Disclaimer I own 23 shares of GME at 273 and I‚Äôm bull. This is not investment advice.* 

Are you wondering when, how, if this will all be over you‚Äôve come to the right post. This ENDGAME DD is about no stock in particular and shouldn‚Äôt be taken as investment advice.

So your answer? If you haven‚Äôt seen this post please check it out. I think it does an ok job at theorizing the point at which a large short has to cover and how we get there.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8t3dm/gme\_endgame\_game\_theory\_best\_scenarios/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8t3dm/gme_endgame_game_theory_best_scenarios/)

User does a great job explaining that there will be massive volatility if we are to go forward. There‚Äôs also a good theory of a pre-squeeze price and post-squeeze price where all holders make value $. No squeeze has happened yet, only a small exit of short positions leveraged back into more shorts.

Things the user forgot to mention as a strategy for someone bullish other than buy and hold.

*Other methods can be used to drive up prices.*

Remove your shares from the available short position!! **DO IT NOW then tell a friend**

GOOGLE SAYS: Phone your broker and put an order in saying that you wish to place **your shares** for sale at, for argument's sake, double today's price. As they are 'on order' they **cannot** be lent out by your broker and in turn, you are reducing the amount of **'free shares**' out there that can be used for **shorting** purposes.

Shorts increased their position! [https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today) If you have **any** stock you want to increase in value, set a sell limit order for what you think is ‚Äúfair value‚Äù, another thing brokers are limiting.

Buying accelerates the process way faster! 21 years is the estimate when they will be bust at current $300 value. I think it was an overestimate that can be much faster with buys. Buys with the conviction that the leadership from is now solid. Buys where you trust others to see the company and its stock growing. Buys because you like the stock. Anyone can buy, from almost anywhere! Asia, EU, Canada, US, find out if you can purchase too. 

**Taking away available shares to short and buying could reduce the estimate to an untenable short term position. Period**

The last thing not mentioned is a margin call. Oh did you invest on margin and over-leverage your position on GME like these hedge funds?  Prepare for an unexpected call when the clearing firm calls in and asks you to meet minimum deposit requirements or sells your position. However, this only happens if bulls are **quick and consistent**. Volatility needs to be so insane and price so high that shorts need to clear out and cut losses so quickly that they never have the capacity to short again.

The reason Robinhood said Fuck You, 1 share a piece was that their DTCC deposit/cash on hand requirements went way up. No speculation, just a fact. They, unlike other brokers, have 56% of 13 million known users who have a stake in heavily shorted Gamer Stock. In theory, if 30% more users bought 1 share of a $312 stock that would add $1,216,800,000 of value. Hedges lose long before that, but 56% is rookie numbers, we can get that to 99%.

Now read this: [https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-30/gamestop-gme-short-squeeze-who-will-surrender-first](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-30/gamestop-gme-short-squeeze-who-will-surrender-first)

In theory, just by buying and holding you could force Robinhood and other brokers to call in their investment from leveraged shorts. Ding ding ding. Three shitron lemons just flashed in a row and paid out. 

However, investing isn‚Äôt for everyone. Huge volatility for your one allowance of share can be involved. If you buy high and sell low that is as much of a loss as someone who shorted a position that was sound long term. My investment advice has always been only put in what you can lose, never 140%.

Buy a ticket to the show. They could sell out quickly. DVF bought 55,000 tickets at such a low price, but low is relative to what is the current high. 

Personally, I think $300 for your ticket to the show is a good deal for the ***HEDGIES LOSS PORN but you have to hold it to enter***.

TLDR; If you have rocket fuel, we will be going to the moon. üöÄ"|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092930.csv|StockTicker|['DGAME', 'GAME', 'OVER']|[]|['I', 'GME', 'DGAME', 'DD', 'I', 'DO', 'IT', 'NOW', 'OOGLE', 'I', 'EU', 'US', 'GME', 'DTCC', 'DVF', 'I', 'DGIES', 'LOSS', 'PORN']|['GME', 'GME']

Allegedly, it was because the shorts tried to launch a massive short ladder at the last minute, just to be... Destroyed by a massive buy order which sent the price back to 320 $. 

It turns out we may owe the buy order to this guy - a freaking powerlifting viking which beat the shorts' algoritms at their own game.

Someone please contact Chris Hemsworth to play this guy in the movie.

This has been posted before but I think it‚Äôs VERY important to know, maybe even should be pinned.


We don‚Äôt know if/which brokerages will be instituting buy-order restriction‚Äôs on GME etc this week.   If anyone who is interested (and can afford to) still wants to buy shares, know that it is still possible to EXERCISE your call options.  By exercising, they are required to give you the 100 shares you bought.

**How does it work?**


ELI5:  each Call contract is for 100 shares at the strike price.  You‚Äôd want to purchase deep ITM Calls, with minimal extrinsic value left in the contract.  On Robinhood, this is manifested as the ‚ÄúTo Break Even%‚Äù, where this number would ideally be 0% for immediate exercise.

https://imgur.com/a/5VGZvxZ

On other brokerages such as ToS displayed in the link as well, you may just have to do some quick maths to figure out the relative costs.


**How do I know if exercising is worth it?**

Immediately Exercising a Call is supposed to be similar to buying 100 shares outright, right?  But since immediate exercise isn‚Äôt how options are usually used, there will be some extra costs involved.

Math:

If $GME is at $300, it would cost $30,000 to buy 100 shares at $300 each.  
**100 shares = $30,000**

If we do this via a (theoretical) option:
Lets say GME is at $300 still.  And lets say the $45 strike Call for Feb.5 costs ‚Äú$285‚Äù each.  You‚Äôll pay that $285 to buy the contract.  Now if you want to exercise that contract, you will pay another $45 for each of the 100 shares you‚Äôre exercising the right to buy.
In this example, (45+285)*100 = 33,000
**100 shares = $33,000**


*(strike price + contract cost) x 100 = the cost to immediately buy 100 shares via options*



Obviously this isn‚Äôt ideal,  but if RobbingHood et. al. continue their restrictions, this will likely be how I will purchase shares of a stock I like.   I would likely be paying an extra premium per share as you saw, *BUT WHO CARES ABOUT PAYING EXTRA IF WE‚ÄôRE GOING TO THE MOON ANYWAY*


**How do I exercise an option (on RobbingHood??**

On RH there‚Äôs a handy little ‚ÄúExercise‚Äù button when you click on your Call.  You‚Äôd just click through the screens to do it.  https://imgur.com/a/BGKCnz1



I‚Äôm sorry if formatting is bad and the explanation was *quick and dirty* but I have a feeling many of us will be stuck holding and unable to buy shares outright once again.  If you have questions I Will try to answer in the comments, and if anyone has something better to explain then feel free.

This is not a mistake. This is not a bug it's a feature. Just, not for you, the retail investor. You should have emptored your caveat.

[Look at this trade screen](https://i.imgur.com/ZRZbWnQ.png
)

On most (all?) app the default type of buy order is the market order. 
Not something that should automatically be limited, but something easily exploited by current big fintech.

If you send a market order on a stock that has HFT short sharks waiting for you, they will see your order coming years in advance. Before your order even makes it to New York city, they will have bought every single ask between you and their highly overpriced ask. 

The dumb robot executing your trade will buy at ANY price without question because he HAS BEEN CONFIGURED THIS WAY BY DEFAULT by your broker. 

Yes, it was your job to know all of this and now a shark is eating your dick, should have stayed out of the water, you intellectually challenged retail investor.

This is how they ""protect"" the retail investor see. It's just a simple, plausible, oversight at worst. And each investor will get bit only once, just a little nibble.

Just in the same way we buy our little 4 shares of GME, just once, no biggie. Protect the investors yes ?

If they wanted to protect the investors, the minimum they would have done is make the default a limit order of 110% of the current stock price. Or something more sophisticated, but the they didn't and they cannot plead ignorance for something out in the open for years, something they have netflix documentaries about.

Extended discussion

The supposed ideal market is a lie, it pretends equality of opportunity in the mechanics of the games however no such thing exists. Traders nearer to the exchange have ""latency privilege"" and can leverage this for a permanent edge over all other players. 

(journalists and politicians, understand this distinction, latency is the big deal, not the many trades per millisecond ones, if all participants had functionally the same latency, there would be no problem (well, there probably would be other problems))

Until the latency privilege is not functionally eliminated, there is no equality of opportunity in the market, the market is not a leveled playing field (duh, it will probably never be and to claim otherwise is ideology bordering on misinformation). 

TL;DR 

Send the latency supremacists to the gulags is what I'm saying, stop GME buys was not about protecting retail investors, because they did not care to do that beforehand, as shown in the very code of the broker's app. The stock market is a retail meat grinder which is fitting since it was designed from the beginning  to leech fat off from workers, so why not double dip and eat their savings too !"|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092956.csv|StockTicker|['A']|[]|['Q', 'HFT', 'ANY', 'HAS', 'BEEN', 'GURED', 'THIS', 'WAY', 'BY', 'FAULT', 'GME', 'A', 'I', 'DR', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME']

1. After all of the ARK buying and increase in % weight for PLTR üöÄ in my opinion it seems like we might be due for another solid run. See charts below:

[Future look at PLTR](https://preview.redd.it/tktocjf79qe61.png?width=1573&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0e445417abc9cddadaad4c6f1052542ad397c80)

2) Next we have the news that the Biden administration increased the value of a standing contract PLTRüöÄ has with ICE. The increase was only 2million but it tells me that the Biden administration loves PLTR üöÄand will continue to do business with them. Contract renewals are guaranteed and new contracts way more likely. See below:

""In 2018, we launched Clearing by Robinhood, our in-house clearing platform. Before this conversion, customers' trades were cleared by Apex Clearing. Since the conversion, customers' trades have been cleared by Robinhood Securities. ""

2) Robinhood initially said that the decision was to ""protect their customers"" and did not mention anything about clearing house issues. They then CHANGED their statement and released new statements saying it was due to clearing house issues.

&#x200B;

3) The CEO came on CNBC and literally said there was no liquidity issue. Although who knows with reports of RH getting additional funds afterwards. But why not mention that you were having some liquidity issues meeting the clearing house requirements in this interview?

Mercury is also the Roman god of financial gain, commerce, luck, trickery and thieves.

Mercury was known to the greeks as hermes.  Hermes Trismagestrus means Hermes thrice great.  If Hermes and Mercury are the same, then Hermes thrice great = Mercury Mercury Mercury = HgHgHg.

Hermes Trismagestrus was thought to have known the three parts of the wisdom of the whole universe - Alchemy, Magic, and Astrology.  Alchemists turn things into gold.  

The number 3 is also symbolic of Abundance, or opportunity.

So either NYSE is saying that there's a lot of opportunity for financial gain, the only question is whether or not it's by buying GME, or milking the retail investors for all they've got.

Hg is also a private equity firm that targets buyouts primarily in Europe and the US.  So maybe they're saying their name 3 times in hopes they show up.

I have seen a lot of posts discussing about holding shares of securities that have been shorted by big players in the market. I completely understand what that will do to those who have shorted the stock but I have been thinking about those people who have given their hard earned monies to these big players to invest on their behalf. Sure, Melvin and Citadel and the likes of them have done stupid things that has manipulated the markets for years but I wonder what you all think about the economy as a whole if these funds were to go down?   
I honestly have no idea who has given big dollars to these funds but wouldn't it be safe to assume that there are probably some pension funds, 401k, education, endowment funds held by them? While the decentralized power of WSBers has really got the entire financial markets spinning, I hope our actions would not result in a crash of markets due to a spiraling effect of these funds trying to cover their positions by selling other securities and creating the downward pressure in the markets.   
This also touches a bit on the moral side of the things where a few million of us here will benefit at the expense of world economies. Maybe I am completely wrong and hoping people around here would shed some light on this.

I don‚Äôt have enough shares for one whole lot (less than 100). Does the rule that market makers have to fill odd lots at best price apply here? 

I don‚Äôt have a limit order now, plan on putting one when it gets closer to my ultimate target price of 40k. Laugh if you want. I‚Äôve been screwed by shorters in weedstocks that drove prices down over 90% across the industry so I need 9900% gains just to get back to where I was. 

For the unfamiliar, all types of nefarious parties in the cannabis space would frequently short a stock and then buy into a raise at a discount to close their position shortly after. The biggest cannabis company curaleaf is built through the profits the founder‚Äôs investment fund made off shorting canadian cannabis. He actually bragged about his strategy on BNN Bloomberg.

So tldr I‚Äôm already jaded and willing to lose all as already have lost all. So will hold until Pluto or bust. Hence 40k target.

ETA: I‚Äôm not asking about feasibility of a price above 10,000. I‚Äôm asking a practical question. 

What happens with a market order, can they fill it with a random bid below the current bid/ask?  I only have a few shares and hoping that using a market order at what I consider to be good time won‚Äôt screw me over somehow. Thanks!

ETA 2: I‚Äôm not expecting the price to stay at an elevated level for any length of time. Depending on trading action, I will of course adjust my lofty targets. I just wanted to know what happens in a one in a million type situation. That will last for maybe minutes, maybe half an hour and then crash down just as quickly.

They‚Äôve had the weekend to decide what they‚Äôre going to do. If I was in their shoes, allowing a game squeeze to 1000 and knocking the price down because they think people will sell is not a bad move for them to make.

Think about the hype of this subreddit, 1k is not a meme is the mindset of most people still. we are sitting at 320 AH, and the germans are going to have to do some work to get us higher in the pre market tomorrow. The goal is to close green EVERY SINGLE DAY THIS WEEK. It‚Äôs the way that GME gets squeezed. A realistic way is if we maintain hype. Billboards, planes flying fuck you robinhood. Remember that we are not actually organized. And tomorrow is the start of what I think is the most crucial day for GME. The swings will be wild, a lot of people have transitioned to fidelity and more and more are coming. We need the eurobros to hold for us. They will tire us, they will start to seed doubt into your mind. Do not let them. Hold strong, hold steady, the squeeze has not happened yet. 

Diamond. Fucking. Hands.

The best part is that he came out of it with a $112,000 profit.

[Original post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7w6cq0/i_somehow_made_110k_this_morning_and_im_still_not/)

Almost three years ago, OP had tried to make a quick $2000 profit by selling barely-out-of-the-money Put option spreads shortly before those options expired. Happy with his quick cash, OP called it a day and didn't look at his phone again that night. In after-hours trading, the price of SPY dipped below the higher strike in the Put spread, allowing his counterparty to exercise their right to sell him thousands of shares of SPY at a profit. He got assigned 86,300 shares of SPY and had no clue until he checked his phone the following day.

The next morning, by sheer dumb luck, SPY opened above the strike price where he had been assigned the shares. It was dropping, but there was a small window of about 15 minutes during which his 86,300 shares, an embarssment of riches if there ever was one, could be sold for a profit. If SPY had opened lower, or if he hadn't noticed in time to sell immediately at the open, OP‚Äôs absurd level of leverage would have wiped him out and put him into serious debt. If those shares had been held through the end of that trading day, he would have owed $700,000.

What about the other option in the Put spread, the one he had bought to limit his exposure to SPY falling too low? Remember, the options were expiring on that day, so his protection expired that night as well, leaving him exposed for the open.

There‚Äôs a reason OP‚Äôs originally-intended trading strategy is sometimes referred to as ‚Äúpicking up pennies in front of a steamroller.‚Äù

This post was peak WSB because it had everything - ill-advised risky trade, poor understanding of the forces involved, flaw in eTrade's risk management system, yet still manages to have a happy, autistic ending.

P.S. - OP had to pay interest to eTrade for owning millions of dollars of SPY, essentially on borrowed money. Apparently the interest on $23,000,000 overnight is $8000, so his actual profit was $104,000 before taxes."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092925.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'WSB', 'SPY', 'OP', 'OP', 'SPY', 'SPY', 'SPY', 'SPY', 'SPY', 'SPY', 'WSB', 'P', 'S', 'OP', 'SPY']|[]

Due to the influx of new people, the sub has turned into a mega echo-chamber and I feel we are missing answers to some key questions that would otherwise be answered by the 2 or 3 people here that actually fuck their own and our wives. 

It was explained over and over again that the shorts haven't covered (fuck them and the media for trying to say they did) and that the price can only go up as long as they haven't covered, because at some point, they have to. And that is fine.

Every single retard also has understood that 1000$ is in fact a meme, because we're not selling under 10,000$. Got it. 

What nobody has properly explained though is the *stability and confidence in the market and its rules*. There have been posts saying that Goldman is lying when they say the market could collapse, which I also understand. But can please someone explain to me and anyone else that might still have some further cash to dump into GME 
- Can they actually change the rules and freeze trading on GME or manipulate it otherwise?
- If they do, what implications would that have? (Can they do it legally? If they do it illegally like RH, can they get away with it and with what would that leave us?
- If what the IKBR guy has said is actually true and there is some potential for clearing houses and brokers to fail, what does that mean for our gains?

I don't care if this squeeze blows up the economy and the market, because it's not our fault but Wall St. fault. All I care is if the Tendieman will make it through the rough sea. I mean, Michael Burry got his money too when the market collapsed in 2008, right? I am 100% sure that without any fuckery, the squeeze has to happen. I am also sure that when it happens, we all become millionaires. But what are possible fuckery strategies they might try and can they actually pull it off?

I used to be way more active in /r/wallstreetbets around this time last year, I just wanted to remind you newbies of the saying I saw every where here - FIRST ONE'S FREE.   
  
I decided to download Robinhood and take our $1000-2000 tax return and play the market using WSB. I was a 10/10 autist - slowly figuring out what a strike, expiration, call, etc is from context and Google. I was an autist so obviously I installed Robinhood and immediately applied to trade options. I started trading with the hope that we could pay my wife's college debt off - about $28,000. I didn't think it was realistic but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.  
  
It started off rough, I lost about $500. After that, things got great. Within a month of starting I had turned my couple grand into $8,700 with positions (mostly calls) in: AMD, Intel, Square, PLUG, the MEME STONKS of that time.  
  
I started to think damn, maybe I COULD make $28,000 to pay off this debt with. Then COVID19 wrecked fucking everything. My account dropped from $8,700 to $2,000 slowly over the next month.  
  
Some other retards got on here and convinced everyone of the TRIPLE WITCHING HOUR which would cause SPY or something to fucking BLOW. I remember almost going all in on that play and I was so glad I didn't - because nothing fuckin happened.  
  
After that I never really had the time to get back into it as my job got really busy due to covid and my wife and I were in the midst of transitioning to the ""vanlife lifestyle"" (its a very cheap/frugal way of life and you experience so much more). I wanted to get back into this with my little bit of buying power left today ($900) but just never made it priority.  
  
MORAL OF THE STORY: THE FIRST ONE IS FREE. SOMETIMES ITS BEST TO TAKE YOUR TENDIES, BUT YOU BETTER FUCKING HOLD YOUR GME. Maybe I'll start playing with my $900."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092933.csv|StockTicker|['T', 'ORGET']|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'FIRST', 'S', 'FREE', 'I', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'AMD', 'PLUG', 'MEME', 'TONKS', 'I', 'I', 'COULD', 'RIPLE', 'CHING', 'HOUR', 'SPY', 'BLOW', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'MORAL', 'OF', 'THE', 'THE', 'FIRST', 'ONE', 'IS', 'FREE', 'TIMES', 'ITS', 'BEST', 'TO', 'TAKE', 'YOUR', 'NDIES', 'BUT', 'YOU', 'ETTER', 'CKING', 'HOLD', 'YOUR', 'GME']|['AMD', 'PLUG', 'GME']

GME short interest is still at 113%. We can still squeeze it whether it‚Äôs Melvin or some other fund on the other side of the trade.

I posted about SLV and it went viral.  I‚Äôm not from citadel or any hedge fund for that matter. I‚Äôm a WSB peasant who has an account in the low 5 figures. 

I‚Äôm even dumb enough that I didn‚Äôt set up my position before posting about SLV so I had to chase calls after they went 10x the next day. I eliminated all chance of myself becoming the next DFV.  Look at my post history if you want to.  

I just don‚Äôt want this sub to become about conspiracy theories constantly.  I want trade ideas and I want yolos and we can‚Äôt become a 100% GME sub.  We need to hold GME to continue the squeeze. I totally agree.  But funds are going to be on your side or against you in any number of trades in the future, and other funds will be on the other side.  WSB tips the scales one or another, but the funds with existing positions are the pre-existing weights counterbalancing one another.  

Also here‚Äôs a video from last year when all of our spy puts got crushed by JPow announcing unlimited QE. It never broke through but I‚Äôm hoping it helps alleviate fears that somehow I‚Äôm some kind of citadel bot or something.

relevant parts 

> SPACs have a complex setup, but Andrew Park, a senior policy analyst with Americans for Financial Reform, argues that there are core problems with the model. ‚ÄúThe first problem is incentives when you issue these SPACs,‚Äù said Park. ‚ÄúThe SPAC sponsor gets 20 percent. No matter what, they get it for free,‚Äù which helps to explain the draw of celebrities, including Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal, and government insiders to the space. That means that ‚Äúeveryone is incentivized to do as many deals as possible.‚Äù
> 
> Because of the incentive misalignment, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs now a worry about how good SPAC sponsors are at due diligence. They automatically get 20 percent for raising the money, ‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to chase after these private companies and good chance they‚Äôre going to overpay for them because they are acquiring a lofty valuation.‚Äù
> 
> 
>  Finally, ‚Äúthe end investors are not sophisticated,‚Äù with many small retail investors drawn to the SPAC space because of the hype around them ‚Äî in part due to the SPACs‚Äôs ability to make claims about future performance that companies going through a traditional IPO are not able to do.
> 
> New York University law professor Michael Ohlrogge told the Intercept that hedge funds will buy the SPAC shares at a deep and undisclosed discount prior to going public, which means that they make money regardless of whether the business plan is sound."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092936.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['SPAC', 'SPAC', 'SPAC', 'IPO', 'SPAC']|[]

After seeing GME, shorters in stocks like AMC should be feeling FOLO (fear of losing obscenely) recognizing that that they can be losing more than 100% in a day and seeing borrowing rates rising.

Some of you know I‚Äôm a big BB bull on $BB 

I love the stock, I love the company, I love John Chen, but it‚Äôs finally clear why BB has been moving the way it has, in tandem with GME 

Prem Watsa is a huge BB investor and owns a large stake 

Guess who Watsa has beef with? Steve Cohen, the guy supporting Melvin in GME, the final boss so to speak of Point72 with deep ties to Citadel  

[Watsa vs Cohen beef](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.theglobeandmail.com/amp/globe-investor/fairfax-e-mails-come-back-to-haunt-a-wall-street-titan/article571008/)

These are billionaires in financial warfare 

Steve Cohen‚Äôs tried to kill Watsa‚Äôs Fairfax fund. In turn killing Blackberry. Cohen‚Äôs group are the hostile players with MASSIVE capital that have been punishing BlackBerry for years 

It‚Äôs obvious now why BB SP has been so low in the market. It‚Äôs because Steve Cohen has tried to squash it due to his beef with Watsa. Same thing they‚Äôve been doing with GameStop, but BlackBerry is more personal for Cohen 

Don‚Äôt believe me? Look at the daily chart for GME and BB 

GME had its first squeeze on Jan 13th, from $20 to $40. 100% gain. This was an astronomical loss for Melvin, who is backed by Cohen 

Guess when Blackberry began its epic run? Check the chart... Jan 14th, MASSIVE green candle 

December 22nd, random and short BB surge out of nowhere, was so random it shocked me as I thought it might even halt for news. The move faded. 

Check GME chart December 22nd, same day GME posted its first big power move from $16 to almost $20. Again Cohen group taking the edge of BB and moving it to GME. Clear as day now. 

This BB surge is Cohen‚Äôs group backing off their BB short, pushing the price up, and shoring up enough funds to move to GME which was hemorrhaging HUGE outflows. Retail and momentum exasperated this move in BB

This is so God damn obvious now in hindsight. This is why BB has been moving in tandem with GME 

This movement is not organic, has nothing to do with fundamentals, or even Blackberry itself!

This is a war between Cohen (Point72, Citadel, Melvin) and anonymous long hedge funds + retail. These anonymous long hedge funds are either using retail or are siding with retail. In the end, funds don‚Äôt give a shit about anything besides profit. So be careful, they don‚Äôt care about sending any message

Investing in BB right now is investing in Cohen losing his shirt in GME

I know I‚Äôll get hated for this but it‚Äôs true and needs to be said 

CONSIDER: 

1) Deleverage, get off margin, don‚Äôt YOLO
2) Hedge with puts 
3) Scale some out 

You‚Äôre investing in between a financial tug of war that runs deep and is directly tied to the outcome of GME. You are not investing in fundamentals of BlackBerry right now! If Cohen uses political leverage which it looks like he has already, stabilizes his position in GME, he will go on the offensive and come back for blood in BB. Just be careful. This is crazy stuff.

Edit: LOL this place has gone wild and become an echo chamber.

The decision over whether or not to buy into this hype, or how much to buy, comes down to one question that you have to answer for yourself: **would you rather regret losing some amount of money if the stock ends up going down, or would you rather regret staying on the sidelines and watching all these other retarded monkeys fill their cages with so many bananas they don't even know what to do with them all?** 

I think this is an interesting way to frame it and I had a moment of clarity last night that I would way rather lose a few thousand if this goes to zero than watch this go to 5k and not be part of it.

If you have EXTRA money and are already hodling GME, or cannot afford GME you should join the BLNK train.**

So let me preface this by saying **BLNK** will not be the next **GME**. There will probably not be another **GME**. For starters it's not going to have an army of kids who used to shop there 15 years ago hyping it, not to mention over 100% short interest and the fact that in the early days it wasn't even 1b dollar market cap.. But it can a squeeze of it's own for it's own reasons entirely and so I have spent time looking beyond just the stock price movements which is what initially led me to start the idea of a **BLNK** DD. I do want to point out some things I noticed while the big squeeze started happening.

* A lot of companies with high short interest such as **IRBT** and **BLNK**, along with those more talked about companies such as **AMC** just started causing the shorts to cover all sorts of positions and move their money around. **BLNK** share price was up to about 65 dollars before falling down to 50 over the past 2 days. It has reached 55 dollars in the past so this wasn't even a squeeze it was just a few shorts deciding to cover their positions most likely because they were getting reamed elsewhere, or just a natural run up because people seem to really like **BLNK** stock. As a matter of fact, they like it so much that it is up *2400%* from 1 year ago. And it's still got relatively small market cap though we aren't in the millions anymore.
* If **BLNK** were to actually squeeze as hard as some of these other companies  have been and somehow reach **GME**'s current 20b dollar market cap it's share price would be $500 dollars. There are plenty of companies with 20 billion dollar market cap. If it just pulled an **AMC** and only jumped 200% in a day it would still be at 150 dollars. Of course if you believed **GME** squeezed already you're obviously mistaken yourself, but the sentence still applies that **BLNK** 10x would still leave it at only 20b market cap.

Is this realistic? Lets take a look at the ways in which **BLNK** is SETTING ITSELF UP to make money in the future, and I say that because as we go into details later you will realized they are currently not exactly succeeding financially, though when has that stopped a company from turning into a success in the past? We will also take a little bit of look at the short interest. Also, these are the kinds of companies who continue to gain more short interest as the price continues to rise.

Okay so **BLNK** is not some new company who just started because of the EV hype, **BLNK** has been a public company since only 2018 but has been a private company since 2008. They had a different name, but merged and acquired a few companies or something, and somehow ended up with the name **BLNK**. Many companies fight for years to break out of the depths of nothingness into a sound business model. According to their CEO: They design, manufacture, maintain, own, and operate charging stations. Their main business goal is to be the owner and operator, so they can be the fuel of the future. They put their focus on areas where you have no other choice but to use public charging.

**BLNK revenue comes from a few different things:**

* **Selling charging equipment:** They sell to third parties Okay, this is not great, but when you add the fact that they are **VERTICALLY INTEGRATED** it really changes the narrative a bit. **AAPL** just decided to go vertically integrated by designing building their own chips for their products, when you design your product and control the supply chain you can make greater strides to improving your margins and expanding your business through natural growth.
* **Utilization**: from people utilizing their charging stations, this is standard and easy to understand. They apparently pay about .12 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity and charge about .39 cents per kilowatt hour. These are pretty good margins and once more than 50% of the cars are the road become EVs this is going to grow exponentially. This will obviously take time but might not be as far away as people are trying to say either.
* **Network of charging stations:**  **BLNK** has it's own cloud based network which will collected *recurring* fees every month. It will also need to be managed, which is also recurring fees. This is also where shit gets interesting because they can use data integration of the network on top of utilization. Of course utilization is going to cost people money but what do we know about companies abilities to collect and sell data in the **AGE OF DATA**? We know that **DATA** is the next oil, that's something we do know, how long and how far will people go to learn your every move, where you charge your car, what stores you're nearby, for how long, etc. This data is will be worth money in time. (side note: **PLTR** LEAPS AFTER THE LOCKUP TARDS)

**BLNK Expansion, Growth, Partnerships, Deals, Future revenue streams**

* **BLNK** recently acquired BlueLA, an EV carsharing company. This was a big move for a little company with negative earnings and cash flow, the fact that they are acquiring things leads me to believe they are actively trying to expand, and beyond just chargers as well. They seem committed to take on the EV industry without being a car manufacturer.
* **BLNK** inked a deal with Cushman and Wakefield, for those of you who do not know they are a global commercial real estate services firm.
* International expansion. **BLNK** has a deal in Greece with **Nissan** to provide chargers to anyone who buys an electric **Nissan**. These people will get access to all of **BLNK**'s network. Let me inform you simpletons who have never left your moms basement, in other countries they are taking the whole EV movement more serious than America has been for some time, with certain countries already having pledged to ban gas powered cars by certain dates. I know the USA is making strides too and not to mention we have Elon but even if penetration is slow here it will not be slow internationally.
* **BLNK** announced on Dec. 15th it was signing an *exclusive* deal with Blessing Health System.
* When **BLNK** signs these types of exclusive deals it often times has contracts for 5-15 years to be the sole provider of charging within the property, this includes charging of all types of equipment not only electric cars.
* **BLNK** received a grant aimed at facilitating the deployment of 200 Blink Fast Level 2 - 19.2 kW charging stations across the mid-Atlantic region, including locations in Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia and Washington, DC. I smell more grants with incoming administration.
*  On 28th of July, **BLNK** and **ENS** entered an agreement  to jointly develop high-power wireless and enhanced DC (direct current for you actual retards) fast charging (DCFC) systems with integrated battery storage for the transportation market. This shows they are looking ahead and willing to work with whoever they need to stay on top of the technology. The resulting DCFC charging solution with high power energy storage will purportedly feature a modular design, and a power output from 100-500 kW. Supposedly it is going to be ‚Äúeconomically priced‚Äù. They are going to look like the concrete parking guard things we see all over the place and they will be able to wireless charge certain vehicles is the idea.
* On the topic of DC chargers (non wireless). **TSLA** uses this same tech for it's superchargers. What else are DC chargers going to allow in the future? Bi directional charging! With bi-directional charging you can go Vehicle to Grid or Vehicle to Home . This means cars can one day be used to help balance energy needs by allowing EVs to charge during off peak hours and give back during peak hours. This is futuristic shit. Lots of stuff to be excited about. If you are confused and don't care about the future, all you need to know today is that direct current chargers have the converter in the charger itself, so they are bigger and faster at charging cars than the AC converters which have to have an onboard converter which converts AC into DC to feed the battery.  It is also going to lead to people to wanting and needing more advanced charging solutions in their home rather than using the ""well I can just charge over night"" logic with a slow level 1 charger. Having the charger do the conversion is the way of the future. This is the way.
* **VERTICAL INTEGRATION**. Did I fucking mention they are a vertically integrated charging company? This is huge. This needs reiteration. This means they design their own product plus build their own infrastructure out, not to mention provide own their own network, technicians, everything. It is very ambitious and nobody knows how far **BLNK** can take their business yet, but what we do know is that EVs are the future and it is still only the beginning of the EV revolution. Advantages of Vertical Integration include lower costs, faster getting products to consumers, less supply disruption or them raising the price on the company, less transportation costs and reduced delivery turnaround times, improved sales and profitability. I really think this is big to the companies growth trajectory yet it is not widely available information about the company.

**Some Other Points to Consider**

* Supposedly **BLNK** has the only 80 amp level 2 charging station currently on the market. Why does this matter to the small brained? That means it's faster than other chargers you say? Sure, that could be technically true, if that's what it was used for. Then why does it matter? Because **BLNK** chargers have **load-sharing capabilities**. The **BLNK** IQ 200 has the ability to load-share between 2 and 20 units from a single 100 amp feed. This is going to be a game changer for apartments, hospitals, any MUD's, honestly any commercial space that has access to a hundred amp feed. They will be able to service many cars with that single feed. But it gets better, the IQ 200 can intelligently share power, and even queue up cars that are plugged in but not charging, so that they can charge once other cars finish charging. **BLNK** envisions higher output being necessary to facilitate larger companies electric fleets, which we can now see happening in the EV space with trucks and couriers looking to go electric. 
* **BLNK**'s pricing scheme seems to be superior to that of **Chargepoint**. For those of you who do not know **Chargepoint** is another EV charging company, who was recently acquired by **SBE** and they are voting in February to finalize everything I believe. With **Chargepoint** they just sell the chargers to apartments and such and let them determine the pricing. They only manage the network. This means if you have to fill your battery up you have to constantly double check prices to see if you are getting reamed from one of their chargers vs another one. On **BLNK**'s network they will charge the same price everywhere. This is a huge plus in my eyes. I am a little unclear which policy would be in effect for chargers that **BLNK** does not have on it's network, because as I've said it does sell equipment as well.
* **BLNK** has mobile chargers with the same power as their IQ 200 but in a mobile factor in case you run out of fuel on the road.
* **BLNK** does not give a shit to what kind of car you drive, it wasn't to fuel all electric vehicles of the future.
* Fleets are coming, **BLNK** seems ready for this.
* **BLNK** can have partnerships with and target the following sectors which we already see some starting to play out: Parking & Services, Commercial & Residential, Workplace, Healthcare, Education, Retail, Hospitality/Food & Beverage, Entertainment, Governmental.
* Consumer stores that add EV charging stations tend to see costumers staying in their stores longer according to data which I have not seen. This reiterates the point about being able to collect money from data.
* So you may or may not know that in the USA **TSLA** still owns about 80% market share of EVs. We also know this will not last forever as every car company and their mother's boyfriend on top of car companies we've never even heard of are all on the EV bandwagon right now. This is going to make a lot of cars that need charging stations and it will be impossible for any one company to win this battle we can safely assume there will be 2-4 major players.
* Low estimates are expecting the amount of charging stations in America to jump from between a quarter and a half million now, depending on if you are counting Gen 1, to low estimates stating there will be between 13 and 14 million charging stations over the next 7 or 8 years.

**The Possible Concerns that keep getting thrown around**

* **BLNK** seems to be issuing more public shares from time to time (yes, dilution) but we know that when a company is trying to raise capital to expand this is a common strategy, and I don't really think is something to be worried about as long as you believe EV's are really going to be the future. I do.
* **BLNK**'s owner and CEO Michael D Farkas sold shares last month, to the tune of 22 million dollars worth. This always makes companies look bad but many people who own and operate a business would scrape some off the top to support their family in case things don't go according to plan, not everyone is an Elon (and Elon was still set before **TSLA** lets be real), doesn't mean he is necessarily up to no good. Not to mention if shorts were attacking you with even shorter shorts every day would it not worry you a bit that they win? This is an ongoing battle for small companies that don't get along with Wall Street. Plus, he still has 6.7 million shares, he only sold about 540,000 for 22 million dollars. This is a drop in the bucket and the man should not be faulted for this, my opinion is that it is no warning sign.
* This might end up being a competitive space that could lower margins and cause financial hardships for the company. This is an actual concern. It could also take a lot longer than people are expecting to achieve meaningful penetration fully electric cars. I do think **BLNK** being poised to expand internationally will help them offset some of this.
* EV is just a bubble blah blah blah blah okay then don't buy any EV stocks, you might be right but you're also a little bitch.

**BACK TO SHORT SHORTS**

&#x200B;

So if the last data I see on yahoo says that that the float is around 27 or 28 million. This is what's not held by insiders, who are unlikely to sell right now due to the fact that everyone knows we are collectively fucking over people who traditionally fuck them over. If a few weeks ago there was 8.8 million shares shorted and the average daily trading volume as of last week close was 14,263,640. This would make it a modest  .61 days to cover. While it's no **GME**, I do believe this is a pretty large short ratio. Especially when you consider how small the public float is. I do believe this situation will be amplified the further **BLNK** moves away from it's ""valuation."" Also with what we've seen this week these people are willing to double down on things because apparently maybe they are just as retarded as we are. 

So **BLNK**'s short interest is increasing at a rate of about 20% per every 20 dollars the stock rises. This is only a simple estimate based off of quick calculations but you can see that Dec. 15 the stock price was 28 dollars and amount of shares shorted was 6.18 million. On Jan 15th  the share price was $47 and the total amount of shares sold short were 8.8 million. That's about 23%. As of right now it's still less than a day to cover but that does not mean we can't see things get frothy from this point on. Most people think **BLNK**'s chance of success sit somewhere around the 0-3% mark I'd estimate based on the general sentiment not only here on WSB but also anywhere else on the internet you look. The consensus seems to be to stay away from it.

Months back some shady research company probably wrote a hit piece on **BLNK** causing it's share price to tank nearly 50%, it had no real substance, none of the claims were found to have any evidence of being true and it is being investigated by the SEC and such, This same company ran an inaccurate hit piece on **CLSK** some time ago. Culper Research is the name if you'd like to look it up and read the hit piece. **BLNK** managed to defeat the shorts that time but will they again? 

Did I mention who else hates **BLNK** charging? **SHITRON** himself. Here's a quote from the shitman himself back in November:

Shitron said, ""**BLNK**‚Äôs valuation makes no sense"" and called the company a ‚Äútotal scheme.‚Äù Left said it is ‚Äúinsulting‚Äù to call **BLNK** an EV stock.

‚ÄúNew most ridiculous EV stock is $**BLNK**. No $$ for R&D, management accused of securities fraud, no real revenues,‚Äù Shitron tweeted.

This goes without saying but every word that comes out of that mans mouth is horse shit. You know this. At this point, literally the whole world knows this. It's not even a question of does he write things based off of any evidence, we all know he would only say negative things that are to cause companies to go down because he has a position shorting them. Does he still have a position? Who knows, but we can safely assume at least at one point he did.

**I try not to use the** ***F*** **word but here goes a bit of simple** ***Fundamentals*** **for you tards:**

Current market cap: **1.85b** Don't need to remind you guys this is still tiny and can still go through some explosive growth at a market cap this small in todays world with the amount of retail investors that throw their money at the most retarded shit you could ever possibly think of, for reference look at **NKLA**. Pretty sure **NKLA** reached a 20b dollar market cap at one point.

**BLNK** has negative earnings per share, and although their revenue is increasing a good amount from quarter to quarter and beating expectations they only earned about 2.26 million last quarter. 

Last quarter GAAP EPS: -.12

Operating Income: -3.50 M

Profit margin: -285.81% 

Return on Equity: -97.33% This tells you how well they are spending their money. 

Yes those are negatives. Impressive, to say the least.

As a matter of fact just about everything you read about this company screams ""***SHORT ME!***"" Think about how many rich powerful scumbags are trying to run this company into the ground. Are they right? Or is EV charging just the future that has not come yet!? What I take from this is that they are spending every dollar they have trying to make it. This is all or nothing for this company. 

**Final Thoughts**

Can we think of any other companies with negative earnings per share that still ended up being great success stories? It's almost like that hasn't been the blueprint for the past 10 years now.. Will it work? Only time will tell. But it definitely will not if these short sellers have their way with it. Also for reference just look at **QS**'s 16b dollar market cap and they don't even have a product. **BLNK** at least has products that are currently going out into the world to be used. Of course the real move could just be puts on **QS,** but I stay out of bear territory especially during bull feeding frenzies. My outlook is that Billions are just the Millions of some years ago, especially when we're printing Trillions out of thin air (Obligatory shout out to the printer man himself **JPOW**). Just remember that we live in a brave new world where kids with phone apps can invest in what they believe the future is going to look like.

Lastly, this is a stock no one has restricted trading to yet, allowing people to buy more than 2-3 shares could seriously cause **BLNK** to quadruple in value. We've seen how fast small market cap companies can jump when millions of autists all buy shares at the same time. Strength in numbers. The revolution of the retail investor has only begun my friends.

Remember I'm just a retard not a financial advisor so this is not advice or anything but I'll let my positions speak for themselves:

**GME** 500 c jan 29 (RIP I TRIED TO IGNITE THE INFINITE GAMMA SQUEEZE GUYS, I DID MY PART AND BOUGHT THAT SHIT ON THURSDAY, GUESSING IF 500C WENT IN THE MONEY IT WAS GOING TO IGNITE A DOMINO EFFECT, I TRIED AND FAILED BUT I LOVE YOU ALL, BUYING MORE SHARES ON MONDAY)

TLDR: **BLNK** is the only vertically integrated EV charging company, **BLNK** has international presence, **BLNK** shares are up 2400% in the past year. It will take .61 days to cover and this number DEFINITELY rising, very small amount of float available, Shitron hates **BLNK**, so do all other short sellers, make no mistake they have put the hit out on **BLNK** and would love to see it run into the ground, **BLNK** is small enough to still rocketship pretty hard, **GME** to the moon."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092956.csv|StockTicker|['BLNK', 'DD']|[]|['I', 'EXTRA', 'GME', 'GME', 'BLNK', 'I', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'A', 'TTING', 'TSELF', 'UP', 'I', 'EV', 'BLNK', 'CALLY', 'AGE', 'OF', 'LEAPS', 'AFTER', 'THE', 'OCKUP', 'BLNK', 'LA', 'EV', 'EV', 'EV', 'I', 'USA', 'W', 'DC', 'I', 'DC', 'DCFC', 'W', 'DC', 'DC', 'AC', 'AC', 'DC', 'I', 'TICAL', 'I', 'EV', 'I', 'IQ', 'IQ', 'EV', 'EV', 'I', 'I', 'IQ', 'EV', 'I', 'USA', 'EV', 'I', 'I', 'CEO', 'D', 'I', 'EV', 'EV', 'BACK', 'TO', 'SHORT', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'WSB', 'SEC', 'I', 'EV', 'EV', 'D', 'I', 'GAAP', 'M', 'SHORT', 'ME', 'EV', 'I', 'QS', 'I', 'RIP', 'I', 'TRIED', 'TO', 'GNITE', 'THE', 'INITE', 'GAMMA', 'UEEZE', 'GUYS', 'I', 'DID', 'MY', 'PART', 'AND', 'OUGHT', 'THAT', 'SHIT', 'ON', 'RSDAY', 'SSING', 'IF', 'C', 'WENT', 'IN', 'THE', 'MONEY', 'IT', 'WAS', 'GOING', 'TO', 'GNITE', 'A', 'OMINO', 'FFECT', 'I', 'TRIED', 'AND', 'AILED', 'BUT', 'I', 'LOVE', 'YOU', 'ALL', 'UYING', 'MORE', 'HARES', 'ON', 'EV', 'ITELY']|['GME', 'GME']

To me, that is a fantastic and valid reason to buy stock. I'd be really suspicious if he didn't like the stock.

Here are my ideas beyond just ""more transparency:""     
1. When a share is shorted, the original holder is explicitly given a synthetic share (GME-SX, or something). This solves one aspect of transparency.    
2. The owners of synthetic shares are entitled to at least half of the charged interest. I do think the brokerages should retain their lending fees, since it takes overhead to support a short market.    
3. A synthetic share cannot be traded. This is the inherent risk in owning a synthetic stock vs actual, you can't move it. You CAN recall your stock at any time, but like in the case of GME, it might take a while before you have a real share to sell.    
4. A synthetic share is not itself shortable. This should solve the overshort issue.    
    
Why bother doing this? Basically, I think that when an impossible position exists, like with GME, ***someone*** is going to get shafted, and I'd bet it's the ones with the least amount of leverage. I think these simple changes will still allow shorting, give retail investors another passive income generator, and still leave the possibility for short squeezes, just not infinite ones."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092956.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['SX', 'I', 'A', 'CAN', 'GME', 'A', 'I', 'GME', 'I']|['GME', 'GME']

This is pure speculation and not financial advice. Honestly, this is wild speculation.

TL/DR of TL/DR: Funds are going to fear monger the markets to gain back their profits through shorting the entire market.

Whatever happens, hold $GME! üôåüèªüíéüöÄ

TL/DR: Funds are going to short the market, sell their long positions to cover their short positions, create a bearish narrative and fear monger the public by spreading negative sentiment through coordinated media campaigns. Then they‚Äôll profit billions from their shorts and buy back long positions at a discount later. Also, they‚Äôll hope $GME and their other short positions will go down in the process to recoup even more of their losses.

The Beef:
Suits are fucked on $GME. They came at us with everything and failed. And now, every move of theirs on $GME is currently being scrutinized by the public and SEC. So they need to explore other options.

They have no other choice but to liquidate their long positions to cover their short positions.... and they‚Äôre going to use this to their advantage. THEIR NEXT BIG PLAY: They‚Äôre going short the market to make back their billions. I believe the suits are going to purposely tank the market through a massive, coordinated sell-off. They‚Äôre going to sell all of their long positions to cover their shorts at a future date, and then they‚Äôre going to promote fear on wall street and to the rest of the world. You‚Äôre going to see increased media campaigns about ‚Äúmarket volatility, uncertainty, sell off‚Äù on all the major news stations and newswires, promoted by the funds. They‚Äôre going to push an entire bearish narrative and create worldwide negative sentiment. They‚Äôre also going to have massive shorts on the market while they do this to put them in a position to make back billions. Once the market is down, they‚Äôll then buy back securities, change their narrative to bullish, and drive the markets up, riding their positions to the top. They control the ‚Äúmarket media‚Äù as we‚Äôve already seen. We‚Äôve also seen how they‚Äôve been able to control the narrative on $GME. And with all of this going on, they‚Äôre going to also hope $GME goes down with the market, as well as their other positions, so they can profit even more.

This sell-off will be a perpetuating cycle, a self fulfilling prophecy. When the big funds sell, other fund wills have no other choice but to sell too in order to save their profits. The narrative will spread and spread. I know this sounds convoluted and complex, but we‚Äôve seen what these funds are capable of. And I can‚Äôt think of any other scenario where these hedge funds come out positive for the year. I hope I‚Äôm wrong. And if I‚Äôm right, I hope the public realizes what they‚Äôre doing.

So whatever happens, HOLD $GME!!!!! üíéüôåüèª

If you are absolutely  new to stocks and options, you should start with likes of Investopedia  to learn basic mechanics and greeks. This post will focus on a little  less obvious things.

**1) I sold options and they became In the money. When will I get assigned?**

Technically,  you can get assigned at any moment since you‚Äôve sold it. But if there  is any extrinsic value of an option contract (if your option is trading  higher than the difference between the strike price and the current  market price of a stock) it will almost never be exercised before  expiry. Watch out for these two events, though: hostile takeovers and  dividend trigger (if the dividend payed is higher than extrinsic value).  Well, also watch out for drunk idiots who exercise by mistake.

**2) It‚Äôs expiry day. At what time will I get assigned?**

Most  often Option Clearing Corporation will trigger automatic assignment of  any ITM options, unless other is configured by the client in his  brokerage. The default automatic exercises and assignments processing  time is 16:00 pm Eastern Time. However, the OCC permits client manual  exercise decisions for until 17:30 EST.

**3) At 16:00 my sold options have expired worthless. Am I good?**

No,  as mentioned above ‚Äì if the price in after hours moves and makes your  options ITM, they can still be assigned until 17:30. Especially be  cautious in the days of earnings or days when 13F are published ‚Äî  those  can move asset prices after hours quite a bit.

**4) Can I buy or sell options before/after hours?**

No,  generally you can‚Äôt. The exceptions are very select instruments. Also,  some brokers offer exclusive packages and allow you to trade options  outside regular hours, but you will be, basically, trading with the  broker himself.

**5) How options and stocks are taxed if I exercise or get assigned?**

Options  premiums are added or subtracted to/from the base price of the stock.  Say, you bought calls strike price 100, for 10$ premium. On the day of  expiry the price of your stock has gone up to 200, Your calls are now  worth 100$, but you still believe that the stock price can go even  higher, you would prefer to own and hold that stock. You can sell those  call contracts and be taxed for profits of 90$ per contract. But if you  exercise your contracts, your base price will be 110$ per contract and  your profit will be your future sale price minus 110$. Works in a  similar way with puts, and short positions in options.

*Disclaimer*: this might not be accurate for all jurisdictions and accounts. This is not an accounting advise, please contact professionals!

**6) Why my options are losing value even though the underlying stock went in my direction (up for calls, down for puts)?**

Options  prices are more complex than simply tracking the performance of a  stock. Again, it is useful to learn the greeks. But to start, you should  understand two most useful aspects: time decay and Implied Volatility.  If you have short term expiring Out of the money options, their price  will decline even if the price of a stock goes in your direction, but  not fast enough.

Implied  Volatility can be described as market sentiment and expectancy of price  changes. The higher is the belief that the price will change ‚Äì the more  expensive are the options (especially with low delta). For example, If  you bought calls after 3 days of insane volatility, but then the next  weeks it moved up for only 1 or 2%, your calls will likely not gain, but  rather lose value, because you bough them at the peak of IV, and since  the volatility seemingly settled down, the market no longer expects huge  moves and is no longer eager to pay big premium for your options.

There  can be also so-called unusual activity. That‚Äôs basically large amounts  of purchases of some particular options outstanding against the general  flow. Those events can change premiums for a period of time too and  often indicate a start of a new trend.

**7) Can I do a Poor Man Covered Call on a cash account?**

Poor  Man Covered Call is a strategy of selling OTM calls but having a deep  ITM call as a hedge. It imitates covered calls strategy. Some people  assume, that since this strategy caps your downside risk, this will be  allowed on a cash account. This is false. Cash accounts allow no naked  options selling, even if your max loss is caped.

**8) What is Settled cash and Free Riding Rule?**

Most  trades have settling periods. For stocks it is T+2 (the day you traded +  2 business days) and for most options it‚Äôs the next day. This means,  that if you sold something, the cash is not immediately delivered to  your account. Brokers will still allow you to buy with unsettled cash.  This is called Free Riding. But if you sell anything you bought with  unsettled cash ‚Äî they will give you a 90 days restriction for violation  of Free Riding Rule. This is very uncomfortable.

This applies only to cash accounts.

**9) If I added to a position under Free Riding Rule, can I still sell if I‚Äôm within limits of what I bought before?**

No.  For example, if you had 100 shares for a long time, but bought 10 more  shares under Free Riding, even if you then sell only 1 share before cash  is settled, you will still get a 90 day restriction. At least on most  brokers that I know.

**10) Can I sell covered calls when I have 0$ settled cash on cash account?**

Not  on all brokers. Some brokers will treat selling covered calls as if you  are using formal 0% margin. And since you have 0$ settled cash, your  cash doesn‚Äôt exceed your 0% margin. Sounds moronic, but that‚Äôs how it  works. You might be caught in this situation if you are rolling covered  calls on a cash account: you buyback those contracts, get bellow your  settled cash and then can‚Äôt sell new covered calls until next business  day.

**11) How to save on commissions if I‚Äôm not using a commission-free broker?**

Some  brokers allow you to configure your orders with numerous options. First  of all, don‚Äôt use their smart algorithms or any kinds of quirky  ‚Äòspecial sauces‚Äô - 9 times out of 10 you will get both worse execution  and bigger commissions. Secondly, if configurable, always ask for an  All-or-None orders.  This will ensure that your order will be much more  likely filled from one source and on one exchange, thus minimizing your  commission. Finally, there are exchanges that offer traders rebates for  added liquidity. For example NYSE Arca (PSE) and BATS offer rebates to  customers for added liquidity in options trading. Yes, you will get a  cashback for your trades. Configure destination of your orders to select  those exchanges. Note: some brokers will provide those rebates to their  users and some will just take it themselves. Note 2: rebates are  offered for adding liquidity; for removing liquidity you will still get  charged.

Hope this helps! Feel free to write your questions if you have some. And good luck with your trades!"|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092956.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'ITM', 'OCC', 'EST', 'I', 'ITM', 'F', 'I', 'I', 'IV', 'I', 'OTM', 'ITM', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'NYSE', 'BATS']|[]

The squeeze has also not yet squoze. GME is trapped at whatever price it is/was when short interest is/was 100%. We've already locked in a profit, and now the trade is a waiting game. 

Rationale:

Everyone's already figured out what happens when short interest is 100%, and there is only one shareholder. The answer is the shareholder names his own price for the stock, ideally about 90% of the net worth of the short seller.

Unfortunately we are not one. There are paper hands among us. There are 67 million shares and an open market. 95% of the shares are owned by smart institutional $GME longs who also spotted the trade and diamond handed all the way with us.

Let me explain why this might not matter at all. I could be completely way off here, but it would appear that the >130% short interest for so long completely broke the valuation of GME, permanently. The reason has to do with game theory.

When short interest is 100%, shorts all need to cover their shorts in order to close their position and make a profit. 

Covering a short is buying a share. Buying pressure drives the stock up. If the stock is up and the short interest is down, you get new incentive to short. New shorts come in, and the stock goes back down. 

Say some paper hand longs start to sell. Selling pressure drops the price. The price is now down, but the short interest is still 100%, that introduces buying pressure. Buyers come in, and the stock goes back up. If short covering happens instead, the stock still goes up, but now short interest is down. Stock at same price with short interest down incentivizes new shorts. Stock goes back down, but now short interest is up again, which incentivizes longs to come in and buy shares.

You see where I'm going with this? I know that sounded complicated, but it's okay. We're all retarded here. 

HOW DID THIS HAPPEN:

This happened because short interest remained over 100% for almost the entire run up to $400, miraculously. At 8:50am on Thursday, clearing houses blocked the ability to buy GME when it hit $468. 

I believe it was at this selloff that the shorts were allowed to cover to below 100%.The stock's legitimate value is now completely unrelated to fundamentals, and legitimately actually valued somewhere in the neighborhood of $300-$400 a share because of this game... and the squeeze still hasnt squoze. 

I'm either incredibly dumb, or there won't be any bag holders buying $GME at $300. 

Positions or ban you say?

Now let me explain how a short can reach above 100%, via legal means.

Adam knows the price of videos tends to go down overtime, and his strategy has been too short videos. He would go to Blockbuster and rent The Big Short, and then sell it too Family Video. Bobby also has the same idea as Adam, so he goes to Family Video, rents The Big Short, and then sells it to Blockbuster. This causes the books to see more rental videos are in circulation, even when it is the same video moving among all these different hands."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092936.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'I']|[]

I've been doing a lot of research and thinking today about where we're at right now and where do we go from here and I wanted to get it all written out for my own sake but I also might as well share with you guys.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Let me start off by saying that I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I an expert but I do follow the markets closely and I do listen to the experts.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I believe that due to a number of factors that I will outline in this post that we could see a liquidity crisis in the next 1-4 weeks. Now before you start calling me a gay bear please hear me out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As you retards have been yolo'ing FD's this has gamma squoze the shit out of the market. This is great until the market rolls over and the same dynamic goes against you. When prices go down, the MM's sell the shares they were using as a delta hedge and that makes prices go down faster.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What happened this week with RH and others halting trading on the meme names was a liquidity issue. RH drew down their $500M credit line and borrowed another $1B last week to try and keep up with you guys! Massive call buying causes the VIX to go up. VIX going up means the hedge funds, clearing houses and brokerage firms aren't allowed to operate on as much leverage. Low VIX = Leverage good, High Vix = Leverage Bad. If the VIX stays up all of these entities are going to have to sell off their positions to meet their collateral requirements. GME has more shares short than actually exist so if enough autist hold then they will never be able to fully cover. What happens then?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

High VIX means everybody needs to deleverage their positions which means stonks go down :(

There is a pending liquidity problem here. If you look at the chart of GDX for example you will see it always seems to diverge downward from SPY whenever there is a pending liquidity event. In general you would expect to see the TLT go up when the VIX goes up. More volatility means you want to flee to the safety of bonds right? Instead what we're seeing is TLT down while VIX is up. It's my view that TLT will come up and join the VIX very shortly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now I'd like to point out that I'm not a gay bear, I'm a bull at heart. The thing is that if we can be prepared for the crash that's coming we can BTFD so hard. If we have nothing at the bottom then there is no money to BTFD!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

On Friday we saw stocks sell off to their weekly lows,  the VIX was quite high and bond yields were at their all time low. Low bond yields means people are not hedging their portfolios and / or they're selling bonds to cover their margin requirements. The hedge funds are now concerned that if the market continues to go down they will need to start to deleverage. There is more margin and call options out there right now than there has ever been. This is where that reverse gamma squeeze screws you over. This could cause a fast, sharp move lower. Think March 2020.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In the treasury market last week the short term treasury yields fell to all time lows. Short interest for everyday stocks are at alltime lows. Put option volumes are at all time lows. As prices start going down, market participants realize they need to hedge their bets and so they buy puts. MM's short the stock in order to hedge their put sale and this is where the gamma squeeze to the downside exacerbates the move downward.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even mutual funds are record long equity and record underweight bonds. As the market rolls over they will also need to sell equities to get into fixed income.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If you look at the SPY yearly chart there is bearish divergence over the past 2 months. What does that mean? RSI has been trending downwards will price has been continuing upwards. This is an indicator of a market trend reversal. The DMARK is also hitting daily, weekly, monthly and yearly high. This is very bearish as well. These signals don't necessarily mean that something that will for sure happen but it is pointing out that there is tons of risk in the system.

&#x200B;

Now look at the Covid situation throughout the world. It is calming down somewhat but the problem is we're seeing new fast spreading strains of the virus that could easily turn the situation for the worse very quickly. This could lead to more shut downs which effects the economy and the market. So this begs the question, are all of these companies optimistic reflation projections realistic? What happens if / when they miss earning estimates?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So what do we do about this? First and foremost HOLD YOUR GME, AMC + BB shares. They might be the only stonks that goes up this week / month. Assuming you're not all in on GME, what do you do with your other money? Spy puts, TLT calls and Gold are where you want to be if you buy my idea that this could be March 2020 all over again.  I know these are all gay bear moves. Feel free to disagree with me in the comments!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Be careful out there guys!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** The market looks quite risky right now for a number of reasons. Could potentially be like last March. Hold your GME shares, hedge the crash with everything else.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Positions: GME Shares + SLV Calls + Cash, buying TLT Calls and Spy puts tomorrow.

&#x200B;

I'm not a financial advisor, please do your own DD!

i know that we are living through a moment of shared euphoria and it is easy to get caught up in it. by all rights i should be asleep by now. but i want to point out how fast this is happening, and how incredibly complex the relations associated with it are. the white house is watching wsb, it's getting front page news coverage worldwide. u/deepfuckingvalue is worth fifty million fucking dollars and is still holding. i have acquaintances and friends i have never spoken to about investing or stocks before messaging me to ask me about gme or amc or bb.

the point i am trying to make is that although we have seen stocks [rocket emoji] before, and although wsb has sometimes gotten fleeting references in say the financial times or the wall street journal, the last seventy-two hours has completely ushered in a new era for wsb. we as a collective entity have broached the mainstream consciousness.

we all know this. my post pertains to how we can use it to our advantage.

my fear is that the casuals are going to lose their nerve and start selling. it is imperative that wsb sends out a message to buy and hold gme, amc and bb (and nok if you're into it, it's 2021, nobody minds what you're attracted to anymore buddy). panic selling because of increased pressure on wsb is not an option. allowing mainstream media to act as propaganda mouthpieces for hedge funds and investment managers cannot be stopped, but it can be proactively countered.

we are seeing historical levels of market participation by people who have never before been a part of the market. if we can convince them to keep constant and hold, prices could skyrocket higher and faster than we have ever seen in recorded history.

&#x200B;

I've found it somewhat suspicious that most accounts saying to buy/hold AMC, NOK, and to a degree BB are new. In addition, when each of these stocks started getting promoted here, other than GME (which was pretty much all that was talked about at the time) we were still almost exclusively an options subreddit. It took forever for most of us retards to learn that shares were important for GME as a special case, but all of the support for AMC, NOK, and to a degree BB was/is about holding shares, which was grounds to get booted to r/investing prior to GME. We're wallstreet*bets* after all. We trade high-risk options and share in our love of excruciatingly erotic loss porn. The people promoting AMC, NOK, and BB didn't/don't seem to fit in with their recommendations of shares. So I decided to look into this more.

&#x200B;

After being reminded by Cramer's video that hedge funds will often manipulate sentiment premarket by pushing the stock up and then slowly dumping it, I decided to look into a premarket comparison of GME and AMC on a random recent day. As you can see below, GME and AMC are both pumped up premarket, but by open GME has been shorted down (and it pops up) whereas AMC is in the stratosphere and falls sharply once everyone in the market is trading freely:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zgykmt8mqqe61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=eeae992d385ba8529a99e2558b270146099f7646

This seems like they may be trying to manipulate GME and AMC in opposite ways. This premarket activity can make people pile into non-GME stocks if it looks like GME peaked and others haven't. I haven't looked at BB or NOK, but my guess is that we'd see a similar divergence between GME and those stocks in after hours/premarket as well. 

&#x200B;

Most importantly, Citadel and Point72 are long on BB, AMC, and NOK. 

# BB

[According to 13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/bb), Citadel owns a whopping 1,068,700 shares of BB, and Point72 owns 519,200 shares. No options are owned by either fund. Point72 and Citadel clearly profit from BB's rise.

# AMC

[According to 13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/amc) (Ctrl+F citadel or point72), Citadel owns 292,926 shares of, call options on, and put options on AMC, and Point72 owns 21,758 shares. It's not possible to know what options strategy (e.g., long straddle) Citadel has in play, but it's clear Point72 and Citadel have both benefited from AMC's enormous increase. 

# NOK

[According to 13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/nok), Citadel owns an enormous 2,950,823 shares of, call options on, and put options on NOK, and Point72 does not own shares of NOK. It's not possible to know what options strategy (e.g., long straddle) Citadel has in play, but it's clear Citadel has benefited from NOK's rise.

&#x200B;

We already learned this morning that Citadel owns a humongous stake in silver, so that is most likely being shilled too. Importantly, if any of these funds sell off AMC, BB, NOK, or silver during their increase, they all have more capital to short GME with.

***The only stock increase that really hurts either of these funds or Melvin is GME*****.** *These funds shorted a viable and successful company to 140%. I know I would prefer to specifically focus on hedge funds that seem to have knowingly engaged in illegal naked shorting (Melvin, probably), appear to have forced Robinhood to stop allowing purchase orders (Citadel, Robinhood's primary financer), or are literally run by people who have been convicted of securities fraud (Point72).*

&#x200B;

# Why did AMC, BB, or NOK get restricted too, then?

The question remains as to why all of these stocks were restricted by many brokers at around the same time as GME. My belief is that purchases on these stocks were restricted in order to make them look like they were stocks that these hedge funds didn't want us to buy. Alternatively, *some* hedge funds are short these other stocks, so it's possible that they were having liquidity issues that also affected the market. But, like I mentioned above, I'd prefer to focus on hurting hedge funds engaging in illegal activities.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** hedge funds profit off of your buying AMC, BB, and NOK calls/shares. These stocks seem to be shilled on here as alternatives to GME to distract us. Unless you want to line the pockets of Citadel, Point72, and indirectly Melvin, stay away from AMC, BB, and NOK. **BUY AND HOLD GME IF YOU WANT TO REALLY HURT THESE ASSHOLES.

I keep it short.....ehhhm I meant long. I tried to add some spice so your brain can digest. Just keep going line by line! You can do it!

I am first of all scared to death that this is going to be removed in a second by autobots - yeah these scary guys from Transformers which you don't wanna fuck with (rather your friends wife to become officially her boyfriend - would be interesting to be for once on the other side of the trade).  Oh and if ever this post remains - this is no financial advice - I have literally no clue what i am talking about and I lost more money than I am ever able to retain - even if GME goes to theüöÄand I keep my üôåüíé

Still I want to give it a try as I think there is two things one could include into the discussion which might add perspective.

First of all I was thinking about the role of Blackrock in this for quite a bit. I think a number of posts mentioned that they are a large shareholder of GME and that they increased their position. For what reason though? I came accross this paper [https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/publication/securities-lending-viewed-through-the-sustainability-lens.pdf](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/publication/securities-lending-viewed-through-the-sustainability-lens.pdf) \- just check the first paragraph. In short: Blackrock lends its shares to the short sellers ..... I leave it to you whether this could be relevent or irrelevant. I thought it is certainly something to take into account but as I said I am just someone who has no fkn clue about anything. Maybe there is going to be a discussion around it (hence the flair) or not.

Second I was thinking about possibilities how one could aquire Gamestop shares in different ways. Just out of pure boredem (ofc) and realized that r/investing mindset for once could be the solution (who would have thought this is ever going to happen!). So I went here: [https://www.etf.com/stock/GME](https://www.etf.com/stock/GME) and was quite surprised to see that some of these ETFs have a significant share of GME in them. I have no clue how they come up with their particular distribution as I have no clue about how ETFs in general work but maybe it allows to acquire indirectly one or two shares. Not sure who would be stupid enough to do so - I am certainly not because I am never ever going to lay in bed with the guys from r/investing but at least I filled this extra boring long time between Friday close and Monday bell.

I am not expecting this to be really something prominently discussed (as I am sure this has been raised a million times before and I was just to lazy to use Search) and hence rather to be removed in a second but it was me a pleasure to give it a try and maybe I am lucky for once.

(Repost due to mistakes)

By  now as most of us know, Melvin cap has lost 53% on its investments and  that's only what we know(What's hidden to the public is way worse). You  might wonder, why the fuck didn't they exit their position yet? before I  answer the question, I want you to put into perspective the following.  Let's say that $GME was shorted around an average price of 40$(which is a  best case scenario for them) with 140%(if we combine all the players)  and on Friday $GME closed with the price of 325$! Which is an increment  of +700%(of the ideal short position of 40$). It means that as of Friday  they have lost their initial short position 7 times over! Them and  every other big player. So what? They most probably went to a margin  call and that's why they got the bailout money from Citadel. But why  won't they cover you might ask? Why prolong the pain and hold longer??

Well,  Imagine that you had the **Infinity Gauntlet of Wall street** with Billions  of Dollars, political power, and all the media in your palms, but with  all of that you got fucked over 7 times by a collective group of apes  who banded together with accounts averaging around 2000$! Keeping that  in mind, do you think that they will ever fold? Due to them knowing that  we are retards, they think that the $GME play is a house of cards and  with the right play the house will eventually collapse to presqueeze  levels. They will never accept a -700%+ loss and will try every play in  their Ivy league book on us. They used every possible trick in the book  from using the corrupt media, to ddosing Reddit and stocktwits, until  they finally were so desperate and used their Ace of Spades(Robin  Hood)(which took years in the making) in order to exit this shit hole.  Initially, it worked but when it started to fail, they went to full  market manipulation mode(stock restrictions). Freezing Buying didn't  fully work on $GME so they went and fucked every other stock they could.  They won on the side tables by fucking $AMD, $NOK, $BB, $AAL, etc...  and that reloaded their ammunition which is scary for me.

Now  moving forward, I don't think they will ever cover because they will  never accept a loss from an uneducated blue collar class in their eyes.  IMO, they think that they will be able to bend us over after all, but  they still don't understand that we don't have anything to lose. More  over, a lot of the people started with nothing and are willing to go  back to nothing if it means that they got a chance to fight and  potentially defeat the big guy on the battlefield. My biggest fear in  all of this is that even if we win, they will make a liquidity crisis as  their penultimate play. Then the government will have to interfere and  again bailout the big guy, because of course, when the small guy wins  for once, there is a liquidity crisis and his win isn't a win anymore  because small guys never win... But the real win, imo, is the small guy  while being poor, underprivileged, uneducated, and using primitive  weapons(metaphorically), being able to defeat a superpower(hedge funds)  in the battlefield(stock market)."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092930.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'I', '$GME', '$GME', '$GME', '$GME', '$AMD', '$NOK', '$BB', '$AAL', 'I', 'IMO']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMD', 'NOK', 'AAL']

We are currently a part of one of the most historical times in the history of the stock market. Now, it is incredibly evident how they will try to make us seem. We are a bunch of fucking degenerates. I mean, a lot of you get off on losing tens of thousands of dollars only to YOLO another weekly on a Thursday night. I get why the media would resent us, the corporations/hedge funds suckle from their teet so they take easy shots. Even though these hedge funds ARE CLEARLY in the wrong. 

We have shown there is strength in numbers and with 7.5M of us, what if we take a small portion of our profits and we create a thread to show, how we took our tendies from this (**WHEN IT IS OVER OFC**) to make the world a little bit better. You could use this post to make it or another, it does not matter. 

**Think about how the narrative could be. A group of Redditors beat the hedge funds and then immediately proceed to give their money back to charities/communities/etc doing more for the world than most hedge funds have ever done. Now picture this, with 7.5M+ of us, if we all donate $125 (an amount I think is doable if you are not paper-handed) that would conveniently be more than a billion dollars given to charities.** Yeah, a billion. While the media and hedge funds are bitching about how these hedge funds lost billions of dollars, here we are: ""a bunch of so-called degenerates putting billions of dollars into charities."" Now it is one thing to tell your kids one day, ""yeah I made a killing during the short squeeze of the millennia,"" but I was a part of something which gave a BILLION dollars to charity. The media would not be able to handle it. We have them on the ropes. Let's bite their fucking ear off while we are at it! 

I will see you all on the other side. **Let's show the world we can not only change the world for ourselves with the stock market but for others!** Thank you for everything you have done for my family. Let's change the world for the better.

This morning I called up Fidelity because I wanted to make sure my extended hours trading was enabled on my account...took 90 minutes on hold to get through.

This report will discuss the current and future state of Blackberry Ltd (‚Äú**Blackberry**‚Äù) and its business viability. Too long has the cycle of research been held in the hands of big banks that are incentivized to publish aggressive price targets at the point of a transaction. Too long have buy-side institutions been caged inside an investment parameter that is geared towards accumulating capital than growing it.

We will be discussing Blackberry‚Äôs product suite and its defensibility in their respective ecosystems, what value Blackberry brings to the world and various valuation metrics to justify a price target of over CAD$100.

The Blackberry product suite is largely deployed in hi-tech environments with sophisticated buyers seeking the highest security uncompromising in the sight of an indelicate user interface. This includes both its cybersecurity and QNX platforms.

QNX is vital to the self-driving ecosystem and will be the de-facto operating system at the point of multiple catalysts. This includes the first approved autopilot system in any jurisdiction, the first cybersecurity attack on a connected vehicle non QNX related and diamond handed people in WSB.

I'm just sharing random thoughts for entertainment purposes only. 

**This upcoming week is the opportunity of a century.**   
**What you do is up to you, but this is how I see things.** 

**First, an overview of what happened last week:**  
\-There was an immense wealth transfer of billions of dollars from HF's like Melvin to the retail investor.  
\-Citron announced that they will no longer enter massive short positions.    
\-Robinhood expands trade restrictions on more stocks, and then retracts them on positions like AMD, AAL and BBBY (no more limits!), and relaxing the share/call restrictions on NOK.  
\-Cramer said last Friday that GME holders ""already won,"" that they must take profits, or otherwise risk ""immense pain"".   
\-CNBC spent all day talking about how risky GME is at this point for the retail investor.   
\-Friday was the lowest day for the market since October 2020.   
\-CNBC also bought ""paid promotions"" on Twitter and FB linking news that Melvin closed all their GME positions. 

Guys, I've worked in the Hollywood TV Industry as a development executive. I know firsthand how the media manipulates the masses. If it's not damn clear by now, we're being manipulated in a textbook fashion so that we sell our positions in ""the stocks we like"". Why? Maybe because Melvin still has short positions. They're a bunch of smart, manipulative bastards. **Except, the bigs f\*d up their media manipulation strategy (or couldn't execute properly due to the overall pandemonium), and I foresee even greater losses for them. Here's why:**

**1) Don't Think of Elephants**

Quoting JGL's character in *Inception*, what happens when someone tells you to not think of elephants? You think of elephants. 

Robinhood essentially outlined which stocks we need to buy by telling us not to buy them. Also, they actually made each of the ""do-not-buy a lot"" stocks more valuable by lowering the supply without lowering the consumer demand.

Actually, how they SHOULD'VE played this was by temporarily adding fees to those specific stocks. This strategy worked for California groceries. Once groceries started charging for plastic bags, people brought their own from home, which stopped excessive use of environmentally hazardous single-use plastic bags. You might think I opened pandora's box on a really good idea. Not really. It's too late. If Robinhood does add fees back, we will migrate to Fidelity, Ameritrade or E\*Trade, if not now, then later. Robinhood's fee structure and profitability is not our problem. They already tarnished their brand. It's too late to add fees now, because it will be ""on top of"" all the bs they did last week. They needed to choose the ""less bad"" decision and picked the worse one. 

**2) Fear, Uncertainty, Destruction (FUD)**

So, in tandem with the brokerages, CNBC and other mainstream news outlets tried to lower the demand on GME, AMC, NOK, BB, etc. by spreading fear that ""retail investors will be in for some real pain"". Do we believe what they're saying? Nope. Why waste precious airtime for the entire day, discouraging retail investors from buying more of the underlying? Because Melvin and other Hf's still have open short positions. Thursday's GME low was $112. If they couldn't buy to close then, they surely didn't do that on Friday. 

**3) Opportunities**

a. **Black Friday of the Century**  
Hold your stonks. Hold your leaps. There's gonna be an immense, pent-up demand and a surge in prices for each of the stocks outlined in Robinhood. They gave us a cheat sheet for what stocks to buy and hold for the immense price hike to come. If you already bought GME and the others, this is like owning a PS5 before everyone got them. Hold, because the prices are gonna be insane. 

b. **Retail Arbitrage of the Century**  
If you didn't already, open up new accounts on E\*trade or Ameritrade, Buy those ""do not buy a lot of"" stocks you can't get on Robinhood. It will be the price arbitrage of the century once Robinhood is forced to lift restrictions on those stocks. Not gonna say more.

TL;DR - There's obvious manipulation by the brokerages and media. Melvin is not in the clear. We must buy and hold, and take advantage of the immense demand surge that'll happen due to the brokerage's desperate, last minute reactive measure. Media manipulation only hints further that GME and other stonks are far from ""done""."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092927.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'AMD', 'AAL', 'BBBY', 'NOK', 'GME', 'CNBC', 'GME', 'CNBC', 'FB', 'GME', 'TV', 'I', 'I', 'VE', 'I', 'CNBC', 'GME', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'BB', 'GME', 'GME', 'DR', 'GME']|['AMD', 'AAL', 'BBBY', 'NOK', 'GME', 'GME', 'FB', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'NOK', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

**ALL WE NEEDED TO KEEP TRADING WAS AN INFUSION OF $7.5B!!!!!!!**

But, u/clash_jeremy, that's so much money! NO IT ISN'T. The US Government ran a deficit of **$3.1T** last year to keep the whole system going. The Fed added close to **$3T** to their asset sheets to keep the whole system going. So, when it came time to keep the system going for the retail investor, **THEY LOOKED THE OTHER WAY!!!!!**

One of the main duties of the Fed and Treasury is to ensure liquidity in all markets. THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT WE NEEDED WEDNESDAY-FRIDAY of last week.

But, what if they didn't know this was coming. Yeah, convenient alibi if the CEO for DTCC wasn't literally an advisor for the Federal Reserve and the FDIC!

Firstly, i think my idea might take some of the pressure off of the mod mail and excessive post problem so please read! (If you know how)

Billboards and plans flying is great and all, but we need to leverage all these social media platforms as much as possible. If you like the stock GME or AMC or BB, then consider flooding Twitter with hashtags. 

A bs stock I can not mention (so the this can get posted) was just #2 trending on Twitter and they are taking all the hype. As much as only posting and commenting on this sub is great, we need the people who aren‚Äôt on Reddit to see that we are not the scumbags that CNBC is making us out to be. 

Take the donation stories, the DD, and Diamond hand emojis and rocket ships over to Twitter and let‚Äôs get #GMETOTHEMOON #AMCTOTHEMOON etc trending in front of these bs stocks trying to steer people away from the real prize!

Tweet that video of Jim Cramer exposing market manipulation, and let‚Äôs expose the hedge funds. We don‚Äôt need CNBC telling everyone how people here are actually using there gains for good we can tell them ourselves! 

The media is being paid by billionaires to make us out to be the bad guys. If 1/5th of the people on this sub each tweeted the same hashtag, we would be number a trending on Twitter and we would be heard!!

What do I know tho, I eat deodorant sticks.

TLDR= ü¶ç strong together! Tweet #GMETOTHEMOON and let‚Äôs get trending on Twitter! üíéüôåüöÄüöÄüöÄüñïüåàüêª

Once upon a time, hedge funds and brokerages decided GME was a dog and is the easiest money they‚Äôve ever made and place positions (puts) betting that the price will go down. They placed bets to the tune of 140% of nominal value of all shares outstanding.

Some autists on Reddit identify this massive naked short bet and don‚Äôt feel their beloved GME (who they have DEEP SENTIMENTAL FEELINGS for) is quite the dog its being made out to be and so, just for fun, start buying the stock and placing call options, betting that the price will go up. They talk about it on WSB because that's what we do on WSB. Taking contrary positions is what autists do best. They almost WILL their beloved Gamestop to rise. It does.
Disbelieving billionaire shorts see this and say WTF? This cant be happening That‚Äôs what celebrities said during the Great Fappening too. It still happened.

The ground swell grows until it hits critical mass and people are making REAL money. Wuuuut, you can transfer money to Robinhood and they will instantly approve you for trading in options? How hard can this be? People who have never bought a stock or placed an option order in their life are making a killing. Word spreads. More join the fray. More huge wins. Loooks fun! More and more and more jump in.

Meanwhile in hedgietown, things are looking really fucking dire. WTF are these autists doing??? This CAN‚ÄôT be happening‚Ä¶ heeelp I‚Äôm melting. They watch their easy money being plundered by a merry band of retards enabled by no less than‚Ä¶ Robinhood. Not only is hedgie sure thing easy money evaporating but they appear to have been somewhere they simply could not have believed possible. On the ""wrong side"" of a trade that potential carries a net loss so fucking impressively large that it might destroy some of the largest players on Wall Street and create an event that would cause systemic risk in financial markets. Doh. We done fucked up this time. Wuuuuuut?
   
The ground swell on Reddit turns into a tsunami. It starts to make the news‚Ä¶

A strategy coalesces among the autists. Hey! If we hold and don‚Äôt sell wont the price rise? It appears to work.

Hedgies now have lost their appetite and have stopped wanking or fucking and haven‚Äôt bathed or shaved in three days. They are drinking that 100 year old scotch they were holding for a special occasion like it was water. Increasingly urgent calls go back and forth among hedge fund managers, bankers and brokerage principals.

On Wednesday January 20th a conference call is arranged between the main players and the CEO of a private firm called Robinhood Holdings.

An offer is made.

 Hedgies: Hey V****. Great little company you got there. It would be a shame if it no longer existed say... next Monday, because it bankrupted the companies that do its settlement and it imploded US financial markets. Wouldn‚Äôt you agree? 

RH: (Silence on the line‚Ä¶) 

Hedgies: Here‚Äôs a big favor we need from you to prevent that from happening. We need you to halt buying on GME on your platform for a ‚Äúfew hours‚Äù. Can you do that favor for us? If you do, we can guarantee you will have our long term support and will ensure that you survive. This will have long term benefits for everyone including you and Robinhood, we assure you.

RH:So you are saying this is a systemic risk event?

Hedgies: Yes, that's what we are saying. 

RH: But what will we tell our account holders? 

Hedgies: It‚Äôs only for a few hours. Just tell them settlement issues or liquidity concerns or something. In exchange for this favor, we are going to give you funding to make sure nothing happens to your company. So it‚Äôs a win-win. Would a 250 million dollar forgivable loan be okay? 

RH: (A long moment‚Ä¶.) Yes, okay.

Hedgies: Done. It‚Äôs transferred.

**Upon reaching the agreement for the ‚Äúfavor,‚Äù hedgies get to work placing enormous bets on GME for the next day (betting the stock will go down on Thursday). They also place huge call option positions for when the halt on buying is released at a pre-determined time on Friday, betting the price will go up. They know after the halt, a violent price swing will trigger their new short positions and when the halt is lifted the price rise will trigger their call options.**

RH halts buying in GME for ‚Äúa few hours‚Äù. The hedgies new shorts placed on Wednesday (for Thursday) are exercised to the tune of billions. When ‚Äúlimited‚Äù buying resumes on Friday, per plan, the price for GME shares rockets higher, triggering the hedgies call strikes. 

Hypothetically speaking, how much could one make if one were a hedgie ~~manipulating~~ saving the market like this? Billions and billions. How much did hedgies need to unwind their positions last Friday, 24 hours before this occurred?? Billions and billions. Hypothetically, that's an amazing coincidence....

Given this hypothetical, would it be enough to unwind more than their Friday positions? How much more? None? Some?

Dunno, WSB I‚Äôm just another retard like you. As proof of that I sold GME on Tuesday at 80 and bough BB.

**Now what IS the move in 2021, is cannabis stocks.** You can see my post history for a more in depth post, but here's what you need to know [Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is already planning to combine multiple marijuana bills](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thestreet.com/.amp/investing/cannabis/cannabis-stocks-watchlist-schumer-sundial-growers-tilray-canopy-growth) and has said marijuana will be a priority of the 117th Congress. 

[Vice President Kushala Harris was the Senate sponsor of the MORE act, which among other things would provide banking reform](https://www.google.com/amp/s/norml.org/blog/2020/08/12/senator-kamala-harris-senate-sponsor-of-the-more-act-chosen-to-be-vp-candidate/amp/) 

So what does all this mean? This means $CGC, $APHA, $CRON, $TLRY and most other cannabis stocks are fueling up for a üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ over the next year or two as changes are announced and passed. [Including the entire country of Mexico legalizing marijuana this April](https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/mexico-is-moving-to-legalize-cannabis-in-2021-what-does-that-mean-for-the-us). 

So AFTER THE SQUEEZE HAS SQUOZE, do you wanna make Citadel more money OR do you wanna put your dollars into the change you hope to see over the next couple of years? I know the decision is easy for myself, and it's up to each one of you to make your own decisions. This isn't advice, and the only advice I do have for you is: Blue crayons taste the best.

This may have gone under the radar with all the hubbub surrounding GME but the significance of this contract cannot be overstated. 


The details of the contract are a little muddled at this time but it appears to be a seasonal contract, as in they Palantir software is only available to Girl Scouts of America during the summer months so they don‚Äôt have to be paying during the wintertime when they can‚Äôt fundraise anyway.


Downside: the price of cookies will probably go up astronomically.

The company generates significant income from [payments for order flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentoforderflow.asp), a common although controversial practice in which a broker receives compensation and other benefits for directing orders to different parties for trade execution. Robinhood refers to this revenue as rebates from¬†[market makers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp)¬†and trading venues.Ôªø While the payments are negligible for small retail trades, a company that directs billions of dollars in trades to market makers can earn substantial amounts. This means that you are not a customer for Robinhood, **you are the product**. Your trading data, even considering it is full of autistic buys and sells, is valuable to the big players in the financial world.

# The conflict of interests

So considering more than half of Robinhood's revenue comes from these big financial companies, all directly connected to big hedge funds, there's a direct conflict of interest between Robinhood's clients going bankrupt and the users of their platform getting rich. The GME short squeeze made by retards like you definitely made Robinhood suffer pressure from its clients and they decided to pick the big cucks side.

# Will retail traders keep trading on zero commission platforms? 

You can't ignore the fact that people are actually retarded, so they will continue to use Robinhood even tho there's always be a chance that all of this happening again. The price of GME only stopped at $400 because most retail investors were trading on Robinhood, **no company should have such a high impact on retail investors** if we are really seeking to bet against cucks from Wallstreet.

Gamestop. GME. My thoughts are on Reddit, under my u/martinshkreli & subreddit r/martinshkreli. Those are authentic and discuss why GME is one of the most unprecedented events in market history. Here, I'm going to discuss the populist attitude that is creeping into this odd situation and add some thoughts on short-selling in general.
  
Let's cover my own unique angle on the concept of a 'short squeeze'. Most would define it as an erratic upward change in price driven by short-covering. I believe short-squeezes defined this way are usually a fictitious idee fixe that aggregates a number of discrete market behaviors and dynamics into a convenient and pithy moniker. The image of python-like buyer constricting some hapless speculator into a higher stock price is evocative but misleading. Many knew me as a short-selling specialist on Wall Street, focused on 'binary events' of biotech stocks. I think I've seen it all: I was once short more than 75% of a company's shares outstanding (I do not recommend this). I bought 75% of a company on the open market, etc.
  
Short-sellers are governed by the same market dynamics as longs. They get nervous when positions go against them and consider exiting. Like longs, they can double down if they wish. The only difference is that, of course, short positions grow when stocks rise. And they can rise infinitely, while long positions fall asymptotically to zero. But both get, theoretically and assuming no fundamental changes have occurred, more attractive as they move against the trader.
  
Short sellers have to pay borrow fees to longs (typically tiny, but sometimes massive). They have to locate stock to short, again usually easy, but sometimes difficult. Both are perilous when those rare adverse times arise. Why? Despite the possibility of a growing cost of renting stock, the ultimate fear of a short-seller is a ""buy-in"". It is nightmarish and has only happened to me once or twice, excluding options-related activity. A buy-in occurs when a broker decides to forcibly exit the short position on behalf of the trader because the broker and trader cannot secure the 'locate' which is supposed to underlie the short sale. The buy-in order is typically violently disruptive: a market order for the whole position near the closing hours of the market! The SEC published a list of stocks at risk of buy-in: the fail to deliver list.
  
My point is that a 'short squeeze' can only practically affect the trader for two reasons. The first is that the trader digs in, doubles down and doesn't exit as his position grows. That's bad trading, and will eventually blow the trader up. But, if the stock is a 'good short', that short will be replaced by more traders with stronger hands/a better entry price/smaller position. What's more is the average investor can't tell if this is happening! The second is the buy-in. I haven't heard GME shorts being bought in, but again, how would you know, other than the grapevine? My point is most of the disruptive, exciting trading here is simply long speculators banging away at the stock.
  
New longs are sometimes attracted to rising prices, speculating they'll increase further: that's called momentum. Those buyers are typically offset by the existing longs who are excited to exit at higher prices. But, if there is a large short position in the stock, a speculator may feel that those covering (buying to get out) short-sellers will provide additional fuel to the momentum. That's sometimes the case, but higher prices should lead to more supply from both long and short sellers. My feeling is the actions of large long holders probably have more influence on the stock price than shorts who dart in and out, and typically in smaller size. Remember that shorts who capitulate are often just replaced by new shorts who are attracted at the new lunar prices.
  
In essence, 'short squeezes' become a self-fulfilling prophecy as new long investors pile in trying to 'squeeze' this sometimes phantom of a short seller, and existing long investors may hold off selling for the same reason. With some Popperian skepticism you will easily see that the same dynamic can exist without the short boogeyman, or with a short boogeyman of any size. Speaking of which, where is Chanos and his slavish groupie, Carson Block? 
  
Speculative momentum can occur for any reason. Let's not forget that the 'trapping shorty' strategy is an awkward idea for a few reasons. Short sellers are often sophisticated market participants who are betting on the decline of a stock. You usually don't want these type of traders sniffing around your favorite longs: I recall writing a 'short report' on a stock to watch it fall 50% that day. If you do a study of stock returns of highly shorted stocks, they are pretty awful. The reason there is 'no arbitrage' is the borrow rate. 
  
But even if you got this poor short to capitulate and squeeze, the amount of buyers who are now holding stock at absurdly high prices put way more energy (and money) into the stock than the short seller's white towel ever could. A sledgehammer killed the fly: now what? Alternatively, are you the host or the parasite?
  
On populism. I don't really think most investors or speculators should go into any investment thinking that there is 'an enemy'. Concentrated (big) investments (bets) give rise to emotional behavior, typically the enemy in trading and investing as it clouds rational thinking. It's a lot better to be Socratic with your 'opponent' and understand what they're thinking. If your position were to be half the size it currently is, would you be as emotionally interested? Try it! You'll lower your risk and feel better.
  
Some of the behavior going on at WSB sounds more jihadist than speculative. The idea that there are some investors who are 'good' and others who are 'bad', or that there is an 'establishment' is BS. Everyone has the same goal: I have a pile of money, I'm trying to make it bigger, fuck your pile--I don't care about it. Anything other goal is contrived, foolish and won't help you win. You can't 'fight the rich' by trying to become one of them. Don't you see the irony? A related thought experiment: what if this trade continued to work really well? And another, and another? Then some WSBers are billionaires. Aren't they the new 'enemy/establishment?'
  
Who do you think hedge fund managers are? They're typically the anti-establishment. Things have changed a bit, but the most successful HFMs are actually the WSBers of the past. These are guys who didn't fit in well at i-banks, often got kicked out for having big mouths or not wearing the right ties, or just wanting to wear jeans at work and not fill out TPS reports. When they started their firms, people like Soros, Icahn, Steinhardt, Robertson, Cohen, Griffin, Loeb (who has posted anonymously on boards), Samberg, even Cramer were fish out of water and had very tiny amounts of capital, often begging for investors.
  
The need for an enemy. To sustain increasingly insane behavior, it isn't uncommon to use a straw man or a scapegoat. Oppressive regimes used this technique in the past, and the media uses it today. Retail investors don't have much power individually. With your $5k RH account, you can't day trade or even qualify for margin. It's pitiful. So, it's understandably quite exciting to finally feel like a 'player' that you read about. To be a part of 'something'. The problem is the media is goading you to be somewhere between a lemming and a life-agnostic but impotent jihadist. Blowing yourself up won't impress anyone, and there is no afterlife here, other than a minimum wage career and mom's sofa. GME and shorting in general is small potatos in the scheme of the Wall St. machine. Don't worry about getting 'even' with the rich. That's jousting at a windmill that will waste your energy.
  
No one here, hopefully, wants to be a lemming. Those willing to 'die on this hill' have to realize something: Wall Street doesn't care about its speculators. The new traders who vanquish the old simply replace them. Nothing changes. When LTCM blew up, or Amaranth, Visium, Galleon, or anyone else, it is 'out with the old and in with the new'. So, perhaps WSB can blow up 1 hedge fund or maybe 5, but so what? Eventually, the tables will turn and it will blow up. The leveraged, fast-money trading markets are a violent place and the only people who care one whit are the brokers charging fees (directly or indirectly). They only care to make sure the sorry carcasses can pay their bills. They know there will always be another speculator lined up, ready to shove his money into the lotto machine. There is no pride here. There is no credit for being a good solider. You either survive or you don't. Your job is to survive and thrive. Becoming a lemming will guarantee failure as per the statistical truism of gambler's ruin (enjoy the proof in measure theory). With enough time, anyone playing a game with <50% success rate (equal payouts), will lose all their money. Get that number above 50%. Add the Kelly Criterion to your trading strategy.
  
You might ask, ""(that's all well and good OR we'll agree to disagree) but, Mr. Shrek, isn't this a good trading strategy? (ganging up on shorted stocks)?"" As long as you're not a lemming/jihadist (willing to walk over the cliff, whether or not you have a ""cause""), and you ignore a somewhat slimy ethical/market manipulation question, I don't see anything wrong with it. There are better ways to make money, since you're asking. Stoking (or worse, participating in) a buying frenzy that is akin to a forced musical chairs game is a little crazy. Once a stock is absurdly valued, you're just hoping the sell-off doesn't happen while you're holding it. If you have enough lemmings or jihadists 'helping you', that's a good thing. They will hold your bag--someone needs to. 
  
Of course, if you've found the ""next"" Microsoft or Apple, no one needs to hold any bags. But, no company can increase its objective (aka fair) value quickly enough for this... phenomenon? situation? absurdity?... to make it reasonable. Those things take years, go slow and steady, and this frenzied buying/""short squeeze"" phenomenon won't let value play a factor. That's why WSB GME longs have shifted theses from ""well, Gamestop was/is cheap"" to ""the gaming cycle"" to ""Ryan Cohen will save us"" to ""...jihad?!""
  
Each member of the herd has its own financial parameters, too. Some may have $500, some $50,000,000 or more. Some may be willing to lose their entire stake (and even more) on an out-of-the-money or levered trade. Some are not. Some were in the latter and somehow end up in the former. Some are in one column at one price and another column at another--some are switched from column to column by force. Today's lemmings/jihadists are tomorrow's sellers. When you're hanging off the mountain, pay attention to the guy holding the rope.
  
Loosely 'coordinated' buying can certainly affect stocks. Heavily shorted stocks and small cap stocks are the kind that require less capital than typical to 'move' a stock. The irony here is when putting on a position, the trader's goal is typically NOT to move the stock with his actions!
  
I still think GME is wildly overvalued, but that doesn't exactly mean I'm 'bearish'. One funny idea here is reflexivity: GME stockholders may become serious GME customers and the company's fundamentals improve that way! Excluding some such miracle, eventually GME stock will trade at <50 again. I still think it will trade at 1,000 or more BEFORE that happens, and that the decline process will take a long, long time (several years). Keep in mind, anything can change. GME can do serial secondaries that destroy its stock. Management's job is to create value for their shareholders--but perhaps they will avoid pissing them off. There's a strange loop! Finally, the stock could be halted by the SEC or completely banned by brokers. Don't overdo it. Watch the borrow rate. Keep your positions at less than 25% of your capital--live to play another day. 
  
Disclosure: I've never traded GME stock and do not intend to.

Earlier this day they were showing indications that media is giving wrong impressions on how shorted the stock is:

3pm ET they gave their announcement on an "" Exclusive [$GME](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&src=cashtag_click) analysis coming at 5:00 PM EST "" ( [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355965388002095106](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355965388002095106) )  which was heavily delayed without further notice. Eventually almost an hour later it was told that i took a "" bit of a delay, sorry "" without any other information: [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356010101983891458](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356010101983891458)

Then again some time later they have published there report which doesn't fit there quality standards and usual work. It gives a strong feeling that they were stopped in publishing their original work and quickly scrambled some stuff together.

&#x200B;

The post and report doesn't provide even close to any useful data or proof to anything.

It's easy to look at the million dollar yolo paydays on here and get jealous, bitter, or simply disheartened at it.  Perhaps even just look at it as if it was an easy day.  But remember most didn't start with a trust fund, they started with a small amount and rolled it into a bigger amount over time.

It's easy to watch someone play a musical instrument and think it looks easy until you try.  Trading is the same way.  It looks easy but it takes time and practice to figure out a system that works for *you*.

And many here have blown their accounts up, losing *everything*, on bad bets and have had to start over.  I've even seen people get genuinely suicidal over losing it all after risking way more than they should have and ending up on the wrong side of a bet.  The stock market is an unforgiving environment, and if money or money making becomes your life you can easily lose it trying to grasp more and more.  There's way more to life than money, but if you're going to play here you need to know what you're doing and the risks involved.

Anyways, right now we're coming off a year of record gains in certain companies and sectors and it's been easy mode.  With the GME and AMC run ups of recent, it's been easy mode (thus far) even more so.  Don't think this is the norm, because it is very much ***NOT***.

After these plays are over (and one day they will be), there will be others.  You'll have to do your own homework (like DFV did for *years* before anyone knew who he was) on potential stock picks and plays.  Please be cautious of anyone who gives you stock picks and I'd actually research them.  I got into GME last year, but I did my own DD before throwing money at it.  It was a decent value play with a very high upside.  But even I didn't think we'd go this far up.

The recent run up feels a lot like the dotcom run up to me.  Different setup and scenario but similar overwhelming positive euphoria and a big draw of people who seemingly have never traded before.  This ended in some serious tears for a lot of people and years of debt or bankruptcy for some.  Getting caught up in a buying euphoria can be dangerous.  Don't let the yolo paydays here fool you, there's been yolo losses too.

WSB isn't your normal trading sub.  This is a place for high stakes bets.  All the memes and humor aside of instant paydays, Rome wasn't built in a day, and your market account probably won't be either.  If you're looking to build wealth and understand the market, this probably isn't the place.  r/finance r/investing and/or r/stocks might be better options if you're new.   Most of the major brokerages have education series on their websites and/or through their apps as well as other online sites that teach basics for free ([investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com) is a fine one imo).  You have a lot of knowledge at your fingertips if you care to learn and make use of it.   Don't be stupid.

**TLDR = HOLD GME for as long as you can this DD is for AFTER the squeeze, once out get your money into PUTS.**

I wanted to bring you some DD that I have been working on but first let me get something out of the way.  I am tired of all the stock talk and we need to get back to some old school DD so we know where to YOLO our GME returns AND talk about options again.  I do not recommend getting out GME for any reason for the below.  This is what I think is occurring now and over the next few months, or faster, pending the severity of the situation.  If the situation is as severe as u/johnnydaggers & u/vinlo make it look then this could happen A LOT faster.

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄGME TO THE MOON üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

The unfortunate part is I am a bull by nature, always have been.  This write-up is extremely bearish in nature but before calling me a üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêªit is only because of the unique situation us glorious folk has put us in with uncovering a massive issue with the market.

What is going on now is starting to look a lot like 2008/09.  I believe that the HF's got caught so bad with their naked short selling that there is literally no way to unwind the damage that they are doing.  For some reference PLEASE read this post as I believe this is the catalyst to what I am posting below.  I was missing a piece but tonight I believe I found it:

[u/johnnydaggers & u/vinlo naked short selling write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9jbc5/listen_to_me_we_cannot_trust_the_short_interest/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I started looking at the 08/09 housing crash and then it hit me that the VW squeeze was also occurring around this time.  So what I wanted to see was how much liquidity came out of the market between the squeeze and the housing crisis.  **Can you believe the VW squeeze dropped the market more than the housing crisis?**  The below SPY chart goes from 7/1/2008 to somewhere mid-April.

* You can see that just after the squeeze started the entire market started to dump.  This most likely had to with liquidity and all the same issues we are seeing now
* The VW squeeze dropped the SPY 37% in about 6 weeks
* There was then a 26% rebound during the **peak** of the short squeeze - This tells me the people that were screwed in this one were consolidating liquidity and once they had an idea of what was going on moved into buying calls prior to shorting the market and exacerbating the housing collapse.
* The entire market was still trending down after this rebound until the lowest of lows of the housing market crash

Here is what piqued my interest.  The VW squeeze dropped the SPY **37%** from beginning to end, and the entire housing crisis dropped SPY **28%**?  **HOW IS THIS EVEN REMOTELY POSSIBLE?**

[I eat chalk, not crayons, they taste better.](https://preview.redd.it/4gzqdeml6re61.png?width=1478&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf799e7b86ec26b0b6afcefdf241cb1b48131306)

So I take this info and now look at the current SPY chart and see what GME is doing to the overall market.  This is where we are now:

If we apply some basic math the correct on the market could be somewhere in the 240s.  Yes, I know how crazy that sounds but I believe this to be the beginning of the bubble popping.  We exposed a HUGE crack in the foundation and I think it is only going to get worse especially if any of the additional data provided above is accurate.  If it is then we could be looking at a correction closer to the 45% overall range in the next 6-9 months.

My plays:

GME TO THE MOON - Mix of options and shares and riding this into VALHALLA

As for the bullshit above I am going to be going with:

315P (4-6 Weeks out)

200/250p range or both EOY

I happen to also believe this to be true, based on every indicator it seems they want us to believe the **false narrative** that they pulled out.

Companies have until February 2nd 6pm EST to submit their reports on Short Interest and then from there it will be released publicly after **4pm EST** on **Feb. 9th.**

I think this means they have until **Feb.9th at 4pm** to get this stock as low as possible to exit their positions, because if come the 9th there‚Äôs still a high short interest rate on the public record, then I think they know retail traders will all double down.

I believe they‚Äôre trying to plant the seed in everyone‚Äôs mind that tomorrow (Monday) is the final day of this phenomenon. So they‚Äôll happily contribute to making a squeeze happen (anyones guess how high) but then they‚Äôll afterwards push the narrative that it‚Äôs over to try to plummet the stock.

I know some people probably plan on holding indefinitely, but for those that do intend to take a profit, even just a partial profit to cover their investments, consider the information above. In the scenario where the stock stays high until after the Short Interest report comes out, it could potentially cause the biggest squeeze yet.

I am not a financial advisor. Please correct me if anything I‚Äôve said is incorrect and I‚Äôll add it as an edit if you‚Äôve provided sufficient evidence.

I own two GME stocks, because I like the stock and believe in the fundamentals.

Edit:

toutoucnc pointed out they could just **lie about the data.** I still think this upcoming date is important to know but don‚Äôt rely on the data that will come out as fact. Anything could be misinformation, and I‚Äôm a noob at investing so take everything I‚Äôve stated with a large grain of salt.

Edit 2:

That said I think the essence of my post is still valuable. They could help us achieve a short squeeze that feels like it‚Äôs all over, but then they could sell off to try to trigger a falling house of cards. I may just **hold** for enternity and pass the stocks down to my children as **relics of the historical event** that led to a mass awakening.

We all felt betrayed when Robinhood halted trading in $GME, $AMC, $BB, and $NOK this week. But they are being set up.

Did you notice that lots of other brokerages also had restrictions?

Robinhood got a ton of awful PR from this. Do you think they *wanted* to fuck themselves over?

No my frens, their hands were forced. So then, who made the call?

# The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ldh3z4hmlle61.png?width=1204&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdae43b722d31696a24c17c6a0dbb7ed8dffa4a6

You probably never heard of them. You've never seen CEO Mike Bodson on CNBC. They like it that way.

But it was the DTCC that **raised Robinhood's collateral requirements by 10x** [this week](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week), causing them to raise an emergency $1 billion and halt trading on many stocks.

Vlad would LOVE to tell you this on air, but he can't. He is completely under the thumb of the DTCC. It's a case of ""we have altered the deal, pray we don't alter it any further""

Listen, I don't trust Robinhood. They're a bunch of ü§°ü§°ü§°.  But at least they provide a valuable service, when it's working.

What service does the DTCC provide?

Zilch. Nada. They are **pure middlemen**, earning a toll while providing nothing of value and taking no risk.

The DTCC is a clearinghouse. A clearinghouse ""settles"" the trades made at the brokerage. When you're manically clicking buttons all day on your phone, each time you create a trade. That trade doesn't ""settle"", and the stock doesn't become ""really"" yours until two days later when the DTCC moves it to your account.

Now if that sounds like some horse and buggy shit, that's because it is. The T+2 settlement is a relic of a bygone era when some broker had to rustle up paper stock certificates out of a filing cabinet and have his fuckboi carry them across town.

Now at some point before all of us were born, horse and buggies gave way to the internal combustion engine, and stock exchanges went electronic. The clearinghouses are just a glorified database run by legions of fuckbois carrying papers to and fro. They're obsolete. But they have money, and therefore powerful friends in Wall St. and Washington.

So clearinghouses had their role protected by regulation. **T+2 settlement is the LAW**. And the DTCC remains a powerful chokepoint that can change the rules to manipulate the market.

You were ready for a fight between David (retards) and Goliath (hedge funds). But the real Goliath on the other side is far bigger than we thought, it's the entire might of the US regulatory state and its leeches.

If you have suggestions for how to stick it to the man, I'm all ears.

# tl;dr

We are getting fucked over by the big bois, and they would laugh all the way to the bank to see us take down Robinhood without even noticing their existence.

# P.S.

A lot of you retards are replying with a link that shows Robinhood is registered as their own *clearing broker* but they still have to obey the capital deposit requirements of the *clearinghouse* they belong to. It was the clearinghouse, DTCC, that jacked up their capital requirements for $GME purchases by their clients this week

>Pulling margin from long customers -  
>  
>The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover.

Literally all we have to do for reaching the **Andromeda Galaxy** is to hold. They are scrambling for every share in the market that they can get to cover and hide their extremely illegal naked short-selling and even more illegal counterfeit share issuing. 

2) DON'T GET DISTRACTED BY FAKE NEWS

There are a lot of posts over the weekend saying silver will be the next big squeeze. We should regard every such post with caution and scepticism. They are trying desperately to divert our attention. So don't listen to these reports and tweets as they may represent a trap. Reminder that they can manipulate data as well (such as S3 short interest data and Ortex data)

3) BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING

Last week, they used disgraceful tactics but expect next week to be *astronomical* in terms of *attacks* and manipulation. The hedgefunds will try everything to force us into selling. Whether it's the distribution of fake news via their friends in the media (CNBC, Bloomberg, WSJ et al.) or short-ladder attacks. We should prepare for everything including trading halts. Know that we (with support of the whales üöÄ) have leverage if we just simply hold onto our shares. 

4) YOU MIGHT WANNA REMOVE YOUR $1,000/$420.69 LIMITS 

**The short squeeze has not [squoze](https://isthesqueezesquoze.com/) yet at all**. When it does, it has the potential to be the beast of all squeezes, forget ***Andromeda***, this may get us to the ***bounds of the known universe***. **$10,000 is not a meme**. 

5) WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER ü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶ç

‚Ä¢Btw if you wanna change brokers but have shares on Robinhood, I advise you to wait until this is over. It takes 2 weeks to transfer shares to another broker like Fidelity and could play into the hands of Citadel. 
You can circumvent this and sign up for Fidelity and others simultaneously to your existing RH account. Diversification is the key üîê.

(example [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/).) 

I'm here to tell you: IT DOES NOT MATTER whether the short percentage is above or below 100%.  Even 20% of a stock being shorted is a bigass signal that locating enough shares to cover is going to be REALLY HARD.

So let's look at why 100% of shares shorted doesn't matter: Shorted shares work exactly the same as money multiplication in fractional-reserve banking.  Picture a stock with exactly 1 share in its float, and that share is owned by autist ""A"". Shorter B borrows the share via a broker, sells to a buyer C, and the buyer C leaves it with the broker. The broker loans it out again to another shorter D, who sells to another buyer E.

Now there are two people who have shorted (B, D) and the short interest is 200% of the float. Note also: three people think they own the stock, and the total shares they own is 300% of the total shares issued by the company.  

**IT SIMPLY DOES NOT MATTER THAT 100% of the shares are shorted because there are now 200% of the shares in the hands of longs.** 

When you count up the total shares held by longs, even 1 share is loaned out for a short results in more than 100% of the float are owned by longs.

So GME has 113% of the float shorted on Friday, which means 213% is in the hands of longs.  This is still a VERY tough scenario to cover.

I went all üìÑüëê and set a trailing stop order, and ended selling my 10 shares at about $1 profit, happy that at least I didn't lose money.

The next day was the first it closed over $100. And it just kept going up. Eventually, I got back on board... Sold most of the rest of my portfolio and bought $1000 of GME for about 2.7 shares.

Here's the dilemma a lucky/unlucky few are facing and why you should help.


I, like several others, turned a joke YOLO into a fortune. Like $5k to $200k in a few weeks. Cool. And now I'm stuck.


If I transfer my shares and options to, say, Fidelity, I lose a week where my shares are locked. Oh, I'll still be able to watch my stock go up and down in Robinhood, but I won't be able to sell anything. That's normal and not shady, it's exactly how any broker would handle it. And under normal circumstances, this wouldn't be an issue.


But these are obviously not normal times. Anyone want to lock up their account for the next week and watch what happens, unable to do anything? No. If we hit the moon and everyone sells by Friday, I'll be lucky to get access to my shares the following Monday. Just in time for this thing to come back to earth.


I could sell everything I have in Robinhood, but that still takes me out for a few days, since the funds need to settle that day, plus 2 additional days. Then, I can send the $ to a different broker. Even if that last part is instant, we're still talking about over 2 days. Again, anyone want to bet on where we'll be in 2 days. If I sell at $300 and this thing makes it to $700 by Tuesday, I'm fucked if I try to buy back in on Wednesday.


And don't forget - if I sell my options and shares, I give them to the shorts, which hurts everyone.


So what to do? Well, I'm obviously stuck for now. But you CAN help. If you're in Robinhood and not in my situation, you can leave ASAP.


Robinhood is restricting buying GME again tomorrow, so you can't get it there anyway. If you want to buy, switch to Fidelity or Vanguard or someone and buy there. On top of that, if Robinhood is 100% innocent (**HUGE** leap of faith there), we overwhelmed them and they actually do need people to leave so people who remain can buy GME again (obviously I won't). If this is simply a clearing house issue and they needed funds to be able to settle due to the massive volatility, the only thing that helps them is if people stop buying GME on their app. And since the whole motto is BUY and HOLD, you really shouldn't be using Robinhood.


So again: if you can, please leave Robinhood because I can't.

I have been around WSB for years under this username and my other, less anonymous one. Check my other posts to confirm I am not hedgie agent scum.

Now, to the unpopular part: a word of caution. I see a lot of DD around here analyzing the short interest, the $GME public float, and theories about what that means for the trading price of the stock. Yes, we like the stock. HOWEVER, all of this DD fails to consider one very important variable ‚Äì the authorized but unissued shares of $GME.

If you look at $GME‚Äôs articles of incorporation (this is the document that gives a company its corporate existence and, among other things, states the number of shares the company is authorized to issue), you will see that $GME is authorized to issue up to 300,000,000 shares. Currently it looks like there are about 70,000,000 shares outstanding depending on whose number you go with. So, theoretically, the board of directors of $GME could issue three times the number of shares that are currently outstanding today.

Is the board going to do that? Your guess is as good as mine. On one hand, the board is certainly not going to go out of their way to help out a bunch of hedge funds that were trying to total screw them over and drive them into the ground. But on the other hand, the board has a fiduciary obligation to act in the best interests of the shareholders of the company. If they can raise a bunch of money selling stock at a $300+ price level, they have to legally consider it. This could significantly improve their balance sheet by allowing them to take out debt with the cash proceeds from a very rich equity sale.

So, could they easily issue more shares? The answer is yes. In December, the company filed an automatic shelf registration statement. This allows them to, essentially at any time and very quickly register a follow-on public equity sale. You can bet your ass that these shorts have been making calls into the company to see what the appetite would be in taking this route, which could allow them to get out of their positions for substantially less than would be the case if they had to cover in the secondary market (because, diamond hands, of course).

Now a couple of good things, even if the board wanted to do this, it seems very risky for all concerned. I think we all know that after the squeeze is done, hitting whatever price it is going to hit ($1,000, $10,000, $42,069???), eventually the price is going to come back to land (could be a week, a month, a year, who knows). When that happens, selling stock at a hugely inflated value based on earning performance (note that I have argued the price today of $GME is totally supported for economic reasons) is going to invite lawsuits galore, so perhaps the board (Which is risk averse by nature) doesn‚Äôt want to make a move without letting things settle out. Time will tell. Also, all of this free press has to be a boon for business and I have to believe that the board sees what happened with Robinhood (aka Robbin‚Äô Gainz) where they totally disenfranchised their whole user base in a single day and saw the valuable lesson there. Thus, this is another reason that the $GME board probably won‚Äôt issue more shares to screw over the WSB investors, many of whom are their target market.

All that said, I want to see the $GME rocket broaching interstellar space like the rest of you MONKEs.ü¶çüçåüöÄüåñüåñüåñüåñ

Also, need to give some love to the rest of the $BANG stocks, $BB, $AMC, and $NOK. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Edit 2: I will qualify my comments by acknowledging the fact that the NYSE does have a ‚Äú20% Rule‚Äù which generally requires shareholder approval for a NYSE-listed company from issuing more than 20% of its outstanding, so that is a real constrain as well.

I wrote an article 2 months ago about why WSB was running the equity markets. I explained how the rise of passive investing (ala Mike Green's thesis) was making it so that the marginal mover of capital was entirely passive, and this is leading to a war between retail (WSB) and hedge funds for the valuation of markets and basically the winner gets to lead the sheep (the passive money). It explains the massive run-up of Tesla/Nio and the endless bids from the likes of vanguard funds once they reach certain market cap hurdles. I won't go into this in depth. Those who wish to find out more should read my previous post and go look up Mike Green from Logica. 

I won't go into details on the gamma convexity squeeze dynamics, and how it is enhancing a lot of momentum and creating feedback loops, for those who want to read more, I would recommend Chris Cole of Artemis capital to talked about this dynamic in the podcast **End Game** with Grant William.

This time around, I will talk about two misconceptions of the market surrounding GME. I will talk about why attacking hedge funds like they are part of the establishment is also pretty misguided. And I will will go over my thoughts on what will happen next.  

**GME Misconceptions**

The two misconceptions on GME have to do with manipulation of GME shares by the brokers and that they are having to do this because the short sellers are trapped in an infinite money black hole. The problem with this narrative is that it ignores some fundamental understanding about how buying shares work. The prevention of GME buying really has nothing to do with market manipulation in collusion with Citadel or Melvin or any market makers. The fact is that the market makers are running trillion dollar flow books and couldn't care less, and Robinhood is not a broker for any hedge funds. The real reason is that some of these smaller brokers don't have enough working capital to fund the required collateral by clearing houses (which was raised on them over the past few days), this is why the largest guys like Fidelity didn't have that issues. Which is why many brokers are drawing down their banking lines (such as Robinhood drawing down $1 billion from banks). Once they bring on enough liquidity, they will enable them again, but until then, we still live in a T+2 settlement world in which brokers have working capital needs. The implementation was retarded, but the brokers basically panicked when they saw their working capital deplete rapidly.

The other misconception has to do with WSB finding in infinite money wormhole. Trust me, I was there when a relative value Fund I interned at in 2009 basically went bust when a short selling ban was implemented. I was there when the Italian banks were on the verge of collapse, sitting on my 10x delta puts with a seven figure paper profit as a 26 year old when Draghi announced LTRO and blew my portfolio up. There are a lot of things that would stop the infinitely money machine, especially if you have been around long enough and have seen all the games being played. One such way is that management can simply issues new shares (likely through a privately placement deal with the short seller consortium), and the likelihood goes up the more the price goes up. Another way is that the SEC could step in and put a short term trading halt while forcing the short sellers into a deal with mgt. 

**Misplaced Hatred of Hedge Funds**

If one looks around the financial landscape today, Hedge funds are actually a dying breed. The young put about 80% of their capital to work in passive while the boomers that are exiting have historically placed about 80% of their capital to work in active funds. As a result, since about  2008, active managers such as mutual funds and hedge funds had actually been dying, even though they played almost no role during the 2008 GFC. If anything, many hedge funds identified problems in the system way earlier and most of the people in the big short were successful hedge fund managers. The problem was that the rise in passive and the fed had manipulated price signals so much so that one cannot actually make money arbitraging value (long undervalued, short overvalued) in a world less and less flow cares about value. 

The narrative being promoted by those who do not understand markets is that these evil hedge funds were shorting stocks, bankrupting companies and forcing layoffs. This could not be further from the truth. The value of a share in a secondary market has no impact on the day to day business of a company. A company could trade at 0 value, but if it generates healthy profits and has a strong balance sheet, it will keep going, hiring people and expanding. The truth is that these ""evil"" hedge funds were managing long short books. They were owning things like Facebook, Apple or it could be distressed debt they thought were undervalued, they were hedging their long book with things they think could go bust in the event of an economic downturn/crisis. 

**What Happens Next**

The effects of the GME short squeeze should not be underestimated, not because of the money lost by shorts on its position of somewhere around $20 billion (that's peanuts in financial markets terms). The full ramification is actually on the long side, from hedge funds who no longer feel like they can hedge out their downside by shorting fundamental unsound companies. I would not be surprised if the action in the markets in the past several days is just the beginning of large unwind because hedge funds will have to now reduce their risk position in their longs, the ramification of which will be in the hundreds of billions to trillions. It could very well be that this de-risking by active managers will lead to the start of a larger correction in the broader market. And as we have seen during the March selloff, without active managers who have cash on their books, who are the buyer of last resort, but instead passive flow, who actually tend to go bid-less in a market crash, we could see increasing volatility the likes we have never seen before. 

If the market does crash, congress may blame this on ""reckless speculators"" and ban option trading for those under certain income/networth thresholds. just as hedge funds are being scapegoated for 2008 despite being innocent, retail may be scapegoated for the next crash despite the real driver of volatility being the rise of passive money. The lack of retail participation in options may mean that he gamma squeeze dynamics will end. 

I have taken off most of my long positions and am sitting on cash and reloading VIX calls and some weekly ATM SPX puts.  Congraduations, you autists have beaten hedge funds (who are more like whales being hunted to extinction than fierce sharks) in the first major battle, but have set yourself to lose one of your most important tools (gamma squeeze). I would suggest taking out your gains and buying downside protection, maybe you'll gamma squeeze the market into a 50% correction and turn yourself into a high-net-worth (HNW) so you can bypass any future retail restrictions."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092936.csv|StockTicker|['WSB']|[]|['I', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'LTRO', 'SEC', 'GFC', 'A', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'VIX', 'ATM', 'SPX', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

##NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION

I am not well versed in stocks, but I am very experienced with high stress situations. This is particularly  true with planned out high stress scenarios where after running through a plan a million times, I have to live with the idea in my head for hours or days prior to execution. **The only way I stay sane, is I make a plan I can live with, get to know it inside and out, and forget about it.**

&#x200B;

The advanced knowledge of an unpredictable, uncontrollable, and dangerous situation ahead can do a motherfucking number on anyone's cognition. What is most important is to not allow fear or emotion change the way a problem is approached. There is a ***reason*** why the plan was made prior, in the calm. Remember, we are dumb-ass ü¶çü¶ç figuratively and quite literally.

&#x200B;

**Everything you do should be done with calm intent.** That means, if you planned to hold no matter what, **DO NOT WATCH THE FUCKING TICKERS OR THE NEWS.** If you plan to buy more, set your limits below market to help attack the short ladders when they come and **DO NOT WATCH THE FUCKING TICKERS OR THE NEWS.** If you plan to ~~sell~~ buy, set your limits and **DO NOT WATCH THE FUCKING TICKERS OR THE NEWS.** If the mechanisms of execution have already been decided, why waste precious head space doubting the plan? Go have a üçåüçå if tempted to peek.

&#x200B;

The moment a plan is changed based on emotion without vetted, new information is a mistake 99.9999% of the time. In this case, having an open mind during the trading day is a bad idea. The time for open-mindedness was the day prior, while peacefully eating oatmeal or Teddy Grahams. Allowing a plan to be adjusted without reason is terrible in life and in STONKS.

&#x200B;

Problem solving works by changing one variable and observing the results. If a plan is changed several times during the course of execution it will be hard to discern where mistakes were made. This makes improvement very hard, and sometimes impossible.

&#x200B;

###TL;DR **Make your own plan, ask yourself if you can accept the positive or negative outcome, and FUCKING STICK TO IT.** No matter the outcome, you will be more peaceful internally and more able to make better choices next time. Calm ü¶ç > Panicked ü¶ç

Here are the basics (not a professional cpa; just someone offering some basic advice):

If you are trading in a tax-exempt account (IRA, Roth IRA, 401k, etc): congratulations, you don‚Äôt have to worry about taxes on your tendies (at least for now)

If you are trading in a standard brokerage account, keep reading:

1) if you bought and sold a stock for a profit within 365 days,* the profit is considered short term capital gains. However, all cap gains/losses are considered together (write off losses against gains). 

Example: you bought $10k GME Jan 1. Sold GME in April (diamond hands) for $1,000,000. That is $990k profit. Now if you decided you‚Äôve had enough for the year and ride off into the sunset, you owe taxes on the $990k. The tax rate will depend on other income you have. It is taxed as regular income tax. Look up your marginal tax rates for state and federal income tax for your situation (ie married filing jointly would pay lower taxes vs single). Rule of thumb: set aside 40% (usually will be more than enough). 

Example 2: However let‚Äôs say you are regarded and try to gamble it all on options in July 2021. Sadly, your $990k is a total loss. Congrats. You have no net gains/losses. You owe no additional taxes. 

Example 3: you are even more regarded and gamble your original investment of $10k hoping to make it back. You lose that too. Now that counts as a net loss for the year of -$10k. Well that sucks. But at least you can deduct $3k of it from your regular income (and carry the other $7k over to be deducted in future years). Note, this does not mean you get $3k back. It means if your income is $50k, you now get to deduct $3k and pay income tax on $47k. 

2) now, if you bought GME Jan 1 and missed the squoze and finally decide to sell in February 2022 for a reasonable gain of $2,000, you have now achieved one of the rich ppl cheat codes for taxes.  That $2k will be taxed at the long-term cap gains rate for tax year 2022. For 2020 tax year, those tax brackets (single filers) are 0% if your total income is less than $40k, 15% for income between 40 and 440k, and 20% if over that). Note there may also be a state cap gains tax as someone mentioned CA‚Äôs is 13-14% (please confirm for your state). If you have other losses, you can write those off against the gains same as before. 

Also tip: all of this is SUPER easy to do in TurboTax. TurboTax automatically links to most big name brokerage accounts and all the calculations of what sold when for how much at what cost basis is done automatically. It‚Äôs super easy to use even you apes can use it. If you have a simple tax situation (eg just your tendies and your regular 9-5), just go with TurboTax. They also have a pro version where you can speak to a cpa if you need help. 




*365 days for short term depends on holding period for asset but yes basically this + 1 day for stocks (ie buy Jan 1, 2021.. sell before Jan 2, 2022, it is short term)

Who would counterfeit shares of these vital U.S. institutions to cause their financial collapse without regard for the U.S. citizens? It is not possible to carry out this massive fraud without the cooperation of large Wall Street firms and regulatory complicity, indifference or lack of competence. Some firms are blatantly selling shares that do not exist.  25 It is impossible to ward off the downward price pressure from counterfeit shares diluting a company‚Äòs value. The entire nation‚Äòs value is diminished when the counterfeiting of securities is rampant. Simply put, this is a defining moment in the history of the financial strength of the United States. Other than home ownership assets, the largest U.S. household assets are tied to the stock market through retirement accounts. If counterfeiting continues, investment and retirement accounts will be backed by nothing but counterfeit shares, which they may already be holding in substantial amounts. To conceal the fraud perpetrated on the retirement accounts is simple, manipulate the markets to crash. The money previously plundered from these accounts remain in the hands of the counterfeiters and the statements sent by the Wall Street firms to retirement investors will reflect a crashed market value of their assets, i.e., you lost your retirement savings. The counterfeiting of U.S. traded securities is nothing less than a fraud of epic proportions. As with other illegal stock market activity, offshore shell companies are a likely depository of the ill-gotten gains. While U.S. citizens would like to trust that government regulators are putting the citizens first and protecting investors, this may not be the case. The ownership and trading irregularities in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac discussed above, seem so obvious, that surely our government would have taken the steps necessary to protect investors in these very important financial institutions from fraud in the market. Unfortunately, the facts do not support that the government did enforce the securities laws against fraud and market manipulation. It is necessary for the United States to do everything within its power to recover the enormous amount of monies that have been plundered from this country and its citizens. Bring the few illegal dealers responsible for counterfeiting stock to justice in order to assure that this United States economic disaster will never repeat itself. There is simply too much at stake to do otherwise.""

In no way should this be taken as advice by anyone or acted on in any way. I am, however, a stock-trading gamer who is currently sipping Pinot while writing this up for your wife's boyfriend to read on the toilet later tonight, all because of the $GME gains.  


Haha gotcha. HOLD! Sorry, Musk, but once my shares head into space the only thing you are gonna be able to brag about is that you land spent rockets on sea platforms.  


GameStop is still a viable company. Make me CEO (or at the very least a VP of some sort) because my Pinot-drinking ass has some baller ass ideas.  


(1) GameStop needs to start an active campaign with gamers protesting our inability to physically own property that we purchased. When I bought *Legend of Zelda* in its sweet metallic cartridge, I was able to sensuously rub my fingertips along the¬†gold cartridge,¬†savoring the pattern of oily smudges my¬†callused hands left. I was able to trade it or sell it to someone, not to mention smell it. There was value in the game beyond just playing it. I could even sell it to GameStop for a whole dollar if I so chose.¬†

GameStop needs to be louder about this.  


Pok√©mon card collecting is still going strong. Folks are chasing physical cards, but what they are not doing is jumping to use the online codes shoved into each pack. Those are meaningless compared to the cards themselves. There is still a lot of demand for physical property, and this can be observed by thousands of gamers who wait in line for physical disk releases, many of whom are paying extra for ‚Äòdeluxe‚Äô versions of their game.  


(1a) GameStop can use this buzz to make agreements with Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo (and others of course) to allow them to sell ‚Äòownable‚Äô versions of digital games. Yes, digital is nice and convenient, but do I own my copy? Can I trade it or sell it for a different game? Allow us to do this with digital copies and GIVE THE POWER BACK TO THE PLAYERS. GameStop can step in and buy back and resell digital keys on their website.  


(2) GameStop needs to become involved in sponsorship of competitive gaming. HEAVILY! They should have a goal to become the go-to name in that rising sport. Why can‚Äôt they host competitions with buy-ins and payouts similar to professional poker tournaments? Why think of the GameStop brand as a simple brick-and-mortar retailer? Amazon sold books, for shit‚Äôs sake, now they are selling everything cheap East-Asian labor can produce while at the same time hosting web services. The sky's the limit.  


That's all I've got for now. I see three possible outcomes to this post: downvoted or disappeared into the dark void of Reddit new¬†(most likely); a series of shit posts about my wine (what are you degenerates drinking? Don't talk to me about your whiskey dicks); or, my personal preference, a running list of ‚Äò$GME go burrr‚Äô and ‚ÄòHOLD‚Äô responses. To the moon, babies.

Any autistis out there with a good theory as to how the shorts that were closed will effect GME stock price?  Mathamatically were they able to dump a bunch of shorts during Thursday when trading was haulted and there was a lag in the indicator? Or did they unload them illegally? Did they unload some during the short ladder attack?  Is there such thing as an option short ladder attack? did they do that?

I don't usually give a shit about up votes/down votes... but maybe stop down voting me so other people holding GME can have the same reassurance I got via posting this.

**Short Version:**
The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options ‚Äì both ITM and OTM).  

Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

* Robinhood sells its order-book to Citadel
* Robinhood is fuk
* Citadel is fuk
* Hedgefunds are gay
* We're all retarded

The man in the little hat is young and thirsty to impress the liver-spotted boomers:

*Boomers.  You all have gross dry skin.  The apes want bananas.  They are rattling their cages repeatedly yelling ""buy banana"" until their throats bleed.  When we ask them how much they want to spend they just reply with ""monke want banana!""  We can fuck them in their pink little baboon asses and punish them for what they did to us with $GME.*

The boomers go wild, coughing and scratching their eczema in excitement.

They know what you want.  They know you'll pay anything for it.  You drove the price of $BB up to $30 in a banana-hungry rage, and as soon as you let off the gas the price has returned back to $14.  This tells you everything:  The stock isn't heavily shorted, this wasn't a squeeze, they were just answering high demand by manipulating you into over-paying.

I buy the DD, I love $BB, but it's not a 7-day play and the price is way too fucking high.  [Look at the insiders dumping shares throughout Q4 2020 at $4](http://openinsider.com/screener?s=bb&o=&pl=&ph=&ll=&lh=&fd=730&fdr=&td=0&tdr=&fdlyl=&fdlyh=&daysago=&xp=1&xs=1&vl=&vh=&ocl=&och=&sic1=-1&sicl=100&sich=9999&grp=0&nfl=&nfh=&nil=&nih=&nol=&noh=&v2l=&v2h=&oc2l=&oc2h=&sortcol=0&cnt=100&page=1). It's a 6+ months play and the returns are going to be 5-10% per earnings report at best, not rocket-leap 100% jumps.  You have to be patient: fuel the ship, calibrate the boosters, load the cargo and only then can you prepare for your trip to mars.  Give $BB time to build the biodome so you can land safely.   Don't hand the hedges and banks extra undeserved banana tokens.

WHAT DO YOU:

* Delete Robinhood & get a real broker
* Never place another market order
* If you just love the stock, buy it
* Strap on your seatbelts we're going to the moon

I say this about $BB but it's true about the others.  Don't let them manipulate you!

Make a sexy and ‚Äúgamified‚Äù stock trading interface and market it to the masses, then use the data to make better trades.  

But somehow I think this beast has gotten away from them.  Suddenly the masses are more interested than ever in the stock market.  They are sharing their ideas and experiences in an open forum and finding out that they are actually in agreement on what stocks to buy.

Here is the problem; hedge funds pay billions of dollars for our data to companies like Robinhood, Facebook, and Mastercard.  They spend billions more on algorithms and the fastest systems just to make trades on companies that WE ARE SUPPORTING.  What value is any of that if you already bought a share of MCD on Robinhood before you even paid for your cheeseburger?  We can suddenly beat them at their own game.

I think the next logical step in this progression is that Robinhood goes down hard, Robinhood users get settlement cuts of a few hundred dollars, and we feel like we really stuck it to the man, but did we?

Robinhood is the best weapon we have right now to arm the lower class with the same weapons as these hedge funds, and they are more than happy to nuke it before we realize.  Sure most out there will move over to other brokers but let‚Äôs face it, other brokers like TD and Fidelity are intimidating to begin trading on, and won‚Äôt encourage the everyday masses to learn more about money.

So feel free to take your money elsewhere and by all means make Vlad and those rich assholes at the top of Robinhood pay.  But ask yourself why Ted Cruz agrees with AOC on going after Robinhood, because he sure as hell doesn‚Äôt care about retail traders.

The very value of everything is being rocked to its core right now.  Hell a currency with a literal endless supply shot up 1000%.  If everyone in our society can make a living swiping their phones all day, maybe Wal-Mart has to pay their employees a bit more or improve their working conditions.

There are quite a few wsb-logo Twitter accounts pushing this. This is BS & the straight up the ANTITHESIS of who we are.

The media, Wall Street, normies, and every other non-WSB autist are trying to push you to buy silver.

For all you that want to buy silver, great, buying the bullion directly in my humble autistic opinion is better than shares in a fund that supposedly buys it but don't trust some autist on the internet.

**ADM and Future for Sustainable Agriculture and Cost Reduction**

Ok, supposedly everyone cares about sustainable business models and the environment nowadays. Which they should. But sometimes it is a little more complicated than just buying an electric vehicle. Food production is a massive contributor to global CO2 emissions. See: [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507104446.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507104446.htm) (TLDR: Soybean trade is bad for the environment.)

Soybean and Corn is currently processed for animal feed. But guess what, you can create animal feed with minimal land, space and water. How? The answer is insect protein.

&#x200B;

Insect Protein Animal Feed Industry

Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and InnovaFeed plan to begin building what will be the world‚Äôs largest insect protein facility in 2021 in the city of Decatur in central Illinois.

PROS:

\- Black soldier fly larvae eat non-compostable food waste bound for landfills + produce hundreds of times more protein per acre than traditional animal feed sources. This will be attractive to the public with the growing consciousness of environmental sustainability.

\- Current animal feed is sourced from soybean meal and corn meal. The massive quantities of corn and soybean farming requires large amounts of land and water. Insects can be grown indoors, requiring far less land and water.

\- **Not only does the farming of insects decrease CO2 emissions in itself, these insects eat and feed on WASTE. This food processing decreases CO2 emissions AND reduces landfill waste.**

CONS:

\- Insect food processing is still not cost competitive with traditional animal feed; however, innovation and sustainability always comes with a cost.

# TLDR

\- ADM is currently holding 10% less market cap while trading at a lower P/E and P/S. (Compared to CTVA, it's biggest competitor.)

\- ADM provides 2x the annual dividend (Compared to CTVA, its biggest competitor.) AKA BOOMERS LIKE DIS STOCK TOO.

\- ADM shows consistent (although slow) year over year growth. Current financials do not project ADM to be a growth stock. I believe this what causes it to trade at such a low price to earnings ratio (50% lower than market average); however, I believe their initiative for a more sustainable business model will change this in the long term.

\- Insect farming reduces required land and water. You can literally raise these in a small indoor facility anywhere in the world...or even the moon üöÄ üöÄ . Insect farming has potential to be much cheaper than current business models. Insect farming reduces CO2 emissions and they feed for landfill waste. You can grow feed for livestock while reducing the amount of landfill waste AND reducing CO2 emissions.

Positions: I am only holding shares at the moment. As we are seeing a current market pull back, I will most likely enter LEAPS 1/20/2023 $55C. This allows time for the insect protein segment to develop. Who knows, maybe they can even get government tax incentives for this sustainable initiative. üöÄ üöÄ

## What Exactly Happened at Robinhood This Week?

There has been plenty of speculation this week about what exactly went down and unverified (although reasonable) rumors on why Robinhood did this. I‚Äôll go over the top two theories before taking a deep dive into the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù reason given by Robinhood.

[**Pressure from the White House and Sequoia according to a Robinhood employee**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/l723kf/robinhood_insider_information/)

This statement has been [refuted by Sequoia](https://www.newsweek.com/sequoia-capitol-denies-pressuring-robinhood-stop-gamestop-trading-after-viral-reddit-post-1565269). I personally wouldn‚Äôt believe the Sequoia part since I don‚Äôt really know what they would gain from it - they‚Äôre a Venture Capital firm, not a hedge fund, and would not be actively shorting stocks let alone be trading in stocks. It could be possible that the White House, or someone from the government did contact Robinhood - actually, I‚Äôd be pretty shocked if no one called them at some point this week to ask wtf was going on.During this call, they may have been afraid that GameStop‚Äôs short squeeze would have triggered a major financial crisis due to hedge funds collapsing and de-grossing, causing a mass selloff similar to what was seen in 2008 and in March 2020 - I‚Äôll talk more about this later. Basically, without Robinhood shutting down GME from being bought, it‚Äôs actually very possible we would have seen the rest of the stock market collapse last week, and this was something the Biden administration was trying to make sure didn‚Äôt happen in the first month in office.

**Possible intervention from Citadel Securities**

This was a theory I personally believed in initially and would have been a very obvious area of scrutiny for many people. The most straightforward one being the fact that Citadel (the hedge fund) dumped a few billion into Melvin to bail it out a [few days ago](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340), who were the very well known shorts of GME. Citadel, the hedge fund, is owned by Citadel LLC, which happens to also run Citadel Securities - a market maker. If you don‚Äôt know what this is, go grow a few brain wrinkles and read my [previous post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ygab/dddd_how_rwallstreetbets_created_a_financial/). Citadel Securities is effectively Robinhood‚Äôs sugar daddy, directly being responsible for around [40% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/a-controversial-part-of-robinhoods-business-tripled-in-sales-thanks-to-high-frequency-trading-firms.html) in 2018 through their payment for order flow (i.e. selling your trades to Citadel, giving them the right of first refusal, and [potentially giving you a worse price](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321); this is how they get 0% commission trades btw).

Theoretically, Citadel the hedge fund and Citadel the market maker is run independently and sister companies both owned by Citadel LLC, but anyone can see this being a potential conflict of interest. There‚Äôs also a possibility that Citadel Securities losing billions of dollars being short so many GME calls (they write 99% of all options contracts) and probably not being perfectly Gamma and (especially) Vega hedged, so when those two greeks skyrocketed on GME they probably lost tons of money there. [According to WSB hero Chamath](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354947541125611526), he didn‚Äôt invest in Robinhood when they came to him on multiple occasions because he thought the founders lacked integrity, implying he believes they might have been the type of people to sell out their users (granted, they already literally do this) and do this type of shit.

**The Official Reason - Clearing House Limitations**

Let‚Äôs get to the [official reason put out by Robinhood](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility), which is that their clearing house, in this case the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, suddenly increased their collateral requirements on GME trades drastically. Apparently, **Robinhood is running out of cash**, so they weren‚Äôt able to provide the cash collateral demanded by DTCC, and hence weren‚Äôt able to trade through them. Let‚Äôs dumb this down and talk about how brokerages work.

Let‚Äôs talk about what a clearing house is and how they work. Imagine Bob wants to sell Dylan a share of GME. There‚Äôs a bunch of legal paperwork and logistics for actually transferring over the share, which can take a few days to finalize - this is called settlement. However, you don‚Äôt want people being able to back out of this exchange during this process for obvious reasons, so that‚Äôs where the clearing house comes in. Let‚Äôs call this clearing house Mary. What Mary does is facilitate (clear) this exchange, and ensures both Bob and Dylan follow through with their trade by having them both immediately give Mary cash as collateral while the exchange settles. If one party was no longer able to meet their end of the exchange (eg. Dylan goes bankrupt), Mary acts as an insurer and is responsible for buying the share from Bob instead. If it turned out that Bob was lying about actually owning a share and can't transfer it over to Dylan in time (failure to deliver), Mary is responsible for finding that share for him instead.

Since GME suddenly became very volatile, and the financial soundness of some parties and their ability to deliver their side of the trade have been suddenly called into question ([at least on the seller‚Äôs side](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)), DTCC decided  (...or due to pressure from other sources?) to increase the collateral needed for buying GME to be more than 10x of the proportion of the market value of whatever it was before. Most brokerages reacted to this by disabling margin trading. For some reason, Robinhood went one step further and disabled trading for all accounts, possibly due to their relatively small cash reserves compared to places like Fidelity, and the relatively large number of users who use margin in the platform.

## What‚Äôs Robinhood Going To Do About GME?

Robinhood‚Äôs decision to stop purchases of GME basically got hate from literally everyone, to the point where it somehow united the country in a beautiful way. Here‚Äôs a list of things that happened as a result of Robinhood‚Äôs decision, for fun

* [Ted Cruz retweeted AOC saying he completely agreed with her](https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905)
* [Protests at NYSE and Robinhood HQ](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/protesters-gather-at-robinhood-hq-nyse-in-response-to-restricted-stock-trades)
* [Class action lawsuit](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/investing/lawsuit-robinhood-gamestop-wallstreetbets/index.html)
* [Someone paid to have an airplane](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rlyx/this_guy_is_flying_a_banner_saying_suck_my_nuts/) fly around the Bay Area over Robinhood‚Äôs office saying ‚ÄúSuck my nuts Robinhood‚Äù
* [Angry Robinhood employees were given DoorDash credits for some reason?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7y5ka/robinhood_staff_unhappy_about_the_trading_hault/)
* [Congressional investigation to Robinhood‚Äôs decision](https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-job-posting-federal-affairs-congress-hearing-gamestop-reddit-2021-1)
* [SEC investigation to Robinhood‚Äôs decision](https://www.cnet.com/news/robinhood-troubles-sec-will-closely-review-actions-that-restricted-amc-gamestop-stock-trades/)

Clearly, this decision has single-handedly made Robinhood the most hated company in the world right now. It‚Äôs especially bad given the optics - their mission is to literally ‚Äúdemocratize finance‚Äù, with the idea of empowering individual retail investors to be on the same level of institutions. This decision, whether intentional or not, has literally gone against everything about Robinhood‚Äôs image and mission, and will end the company if not fixed soon. **All of this right as Robinhood is planning to launch their IPO**.

The people in charge of Robinhood likely know all of this and are doing everything they can to find cash and liquidity to put up the collateral needed to resume GME trading. So far we‚Äôve seen them raise $1B from investors and $500M through lines of credit overnight, although based on the fact that GME is still restricted, that doesn‚Äôt seem to be enough. However, in my personal opinion, I think it's likely that Robinhood is doing everything they can to find more money given the situation, and once they do, **they will likely re-enable trading on GME. If that happens (which IMO will probably be some time next week), GME and all other high-SI stocks will absolutely** üöÄüåù\*\*.\*\*

## How GME Almost Caused (and Still Can Cause) a Stock Market Crash

Let‚Äôs go over something else interesting that went on as a result of the GME short squeeze - the fact that it started to affect the stock market overall. In fact, the stock market had the largest decline since October across all sectors on Wednesday when GME, AMC, and other high-SI stocks surged, with a very sharp recovery as the meme stocks fell after Robinhood suspending purchases; this was one of the biggest de-grossing of hedge funds in history. [Chamath wrote a great Twitter thread about this](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354883147523997697), so amazing that I‚Äôll just copy-paste his tweets rather than try to explain it better myself.

[Hedge fund grossing \/ de-grossing](https://preview.redd.it/c5we1d7e0se61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a11131168d69e5f3aea93c8fd087a1478500ddc)

In other words, as stocks like GME go up, the highly-leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts. Most retail investors are limited to 2x leverage, but since hedge funds are ‚Äúhedged‚Äù by taking short and long positions, they can be up to 30x levered since theoretically they would be shielded from external events that cause all stocks to go up or down in price (i.e. Beta neutral), so they‚Äôre ‚Äúsafer‚Äù. To get out of these short positions, they will need to massively unwind their long positions as well so they can still have a reasonable ‚ÄúNet Exposure‚Äù, triggering a sell-off in those stocks.

A very similar thing actually happened in March (with risk-parity) causing hedge funds to similarly massively de-gross, and literally everything from GLD to even AMZN‚Äôs stock price dropping as a result, even though theoretically COVID-19 would‚Äôve been good for both from a fundamental basis, as we saw later on. It‚Äôs very likely that if Robinhood hadn‚Äôt stopped purchases of GME, many more hedge funds shorts would have had their shorts blow up and be forced to continue to de-gross causing a widespread stock market crash, potentially being the catalyst for finally popping the [decade-long liquidity (leverage)-fueled asset bubble we‚Äôve been experiencing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) In fact, this could still happen since it doesn‚Äôt look like hedge funds have learned their lesson and **are still heavily short GME with Net Shares Shorts barely moving this week** [**according to S3 Partners**](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355225495835709441)**.** Furthermore, despite seeing the largest de-grossing of hedge funds since 2009, **gross exposure (aka leverage) of hedge funds still remains** [**close to record-high levels**](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-hedgefunds/goldman-sees-hedge-fund-exposures-close-to-records-ongoing-sell-off-risk-after-gamestop-swings-idUSL1N2K60GW).

**TLDR**

In case your attention span was too short to read everything above,

1. Robinhood is going to be doing everything they can to raise cash to resume GME purchases, when this happen GME üöÄüåù
2. Much of the stock market‚Äôs value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so **if GME (and other common shorts) üöÄüåù the rest of the stock market might collapse around it, triggering a financial crisis**

*Now, just to be clear, buying GME right now is joining a game of hot potato; the longer you hold the potato the more tendies you get to eat for dinner, but at some point this will all blow up and when it does someone will be the bagholder - and right now everyone is rooting for these bagholders to be the hedge funds that are short GME. That being said, with Short Interest barely moving this week, this day of reckoning doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôll be coming in the next few days and for reasons mentioned above, it‚Äôs probably more likely for GME to reach $1K next week than the probability that it‚Äôll fall below $100.*

Or in other words, [I like these stocks](https://www.highshortinterest.com/).

EDIT - Appearently S3 Partners just contradicted [their tweet on Friday](https://s3partners.com/Exclusive.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=announcement&utm_campaign=10ds) and now indicate that shares short of GME have dipped below 30M shares.

They are in full panic mode and their only shot of having control is to shift blame from them to you. 

The Federal Reserve Cartel has been printing dollars into oblivion. The average normie does not understand the everything bubble we are in and they do not understand dollar inflation. Thus far I've had to explain what a ""short"" is to about 5 people who know nothing of whats going on other than what the talking heads on the TV screen are telling them. Because of this it will be very easy for the MSM to convince niave Boomers and others ignorant of the markets and financial terminology that it was ""memes and shit posting"" by all of us ""unsophisticated investors"" who are to blame for the economic black swan event unfolding. Their ""Problem, reaction, solution"" is to make it seem like YOU are the cause of the economic and financial collapse by simply turning their own game on them. The reaction will be the demand for help coming from the normies and mid-wits who are niave and ignorant as to why shit hit the fan. The solution will be ""New regulations to make sure this will NEVER happen again!"" And thats where they think they will fuck you... Only this time they won't. You must not allow this to become what happened after 9/11 where the problem and solution led to them fucking us over with bullshit unconstitutional laws. 

We all know who the real criminals are.

We all know their game. 

Make no mistake, all the talking TV heads have their scripts ready and all the politicians and regulators have their ""new"" laws ready to be signed. They will make sure that only the ""sophisticated investors"" can invest while they add taxes and regs that will squeeze the little guy out of the markets. 

You think AOC supports what happened to Melvin because she's so adept at economics and financial matters? She has an agenda with her band of retards to slip in taxes that will fuck you. 

Politics aside, no one in DC is your friend and anyone showing you ""support"" is only waiting long enough to drive their knife into your backs with regulations and taxes. 

And last... If you are buying Silver, BUY PHYSICAL SILVER. DO NOT BUY ETF's, THAT IS HOW THEY WILL FUCK YOU. IF YOU BUY PHYSICAL, THAT IS HOW YOU WILL FUCK THEM. (I'm not a financial advisor, this not financial advise, blah blah blah, don't be a fucking retard, do your due diligence)

How will you get ahead of their pre-planed narrative and ""solution"" to ""the retail investor question""?

Since the short squeeze maybe around the corner I am just posting as a reminder to all the fellow soldiers in this war against the shorts.

Now...Many of us are making money we haven't seen in our lives, and some of us haven't invested at all.

This euphoria may make people forget the that...***Uncle Sam wants his cut.üíµüá∫üá∏***

I know this gets mentioned in the comments but we can forget when we see the share price rocket, so this needs to be reiterated over and over. Also, I don't want anyone to get fucked next April because they forgot about some boring shit like taxes and income brackets. ***The IRS DOES NOT fuck around. The IRS is basically Liam Neeson in Taken -- ""If you let my daughter go now that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue  you, but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will kill you.‚Äù***  They will find you and take what is theirs.

Remember, your gains will cover your taxes so set aside money for it when you cash out.

**How much you need to set aside depends on the state you live in and how much you make/made. So, please find out how much you need to set aside BEFORE you starting using the tendies!**  
If you live in a no income tax state like Texas or Washington, then great you get to keep more money, but you still have to pay federal income tax.

***Please don't be a retard and invest it back in because you can lose it.*** *Put it in a savings account, let it sit as cash in your brokerage account, or withdraw it and stuff it under your mattress (the worst idea but to   each their own)*

If you want to invest, then invest your other profits minus the tax money.

***If you are a dependent, then please talk to your parents/guardians.*** (***Realistically this mostly pertains to college students because anyone under 18 years can't open a brokerage on their own. But if your parents/guardians don't  know and you are under 18, then please talk to them.)***

**Most important for moving up in income brackets (PLEASE FUCKING READ IT):Some people will be jumping income tax brackets, and will be out of the low-income thresholds.**   If this you think this will be you and you are currently getting low-income benefits like medi-cal, food stamps, etc. Please set aside money to pay for healthcare if you aren't getting any from your work.

Okay boring tax reminder set aside...***This next part is for the college students that are going to make bank, because I know there are a few.***

Some of you autists are college students and are getting FAFSA or some need-based financial aid. ***Make sure you aren't going to fuck yourself out of financial aid*** because some of you WILL be fucking yourself out of financial aid and I hope you have a plan for it by working or applying for scholarships.

Colleges will be the ones eating your tendies; if you lose financial aid and don't have a plan.

Why I say some is because FAFSA only looks at prior taxes so next year's FAFSA will ask for 2020 taxes but tendies are coming in 2021 so you have one year of financial aid before FAFSA asks for 2021 taxes which is going to fuck you hard.Technically if you are graduating in 2023 you will be fine, I think, because the 2022-2023 FAFSA application will open in Oct 2021 so it will ask for 2020 taxes.(There are other questions about how much money have invested, in checking/saving accounts, and what not, but FAFSA really cares about your adjusted gross income which will be high because we are leaving this fucking solar system üöÄüöÄüöÄ)

2023-2024 FAFSA application will ask for 2021 taxes, so if you think you are going to be applying for financial aid for those years, then please have a plan ready.

**Again, please make sure you find out everything IMMEDIATELY AFTER cashing in for the tendies!!**

I am not a financial advisor, or CPA. \*insert whatever legal disclaimer here\*

Now, why should this scare you? Imagine a financial system full of Chads. These Chads got greedy, just like they did before, and let's be real, Chad's don't learn their lessons. These same Chads didn't just short one stonk, i.e GameStop, these factory reject dildos shorted pretty much everything. Refer to the list of stocks with short percents above 60%. That's why it's not just GME that's being squeezed, it's BB, it's NOK, it's FIZZ, it's MAC, it's every single highly shorted stock because these Chads just realized that they have to cover their pasty asses from being completely obliterated.

The thing about these Chads though is they convinced Brett, Cody, Kevin & Pauly, the yacht owning, sperry and plaid short wearing dude bros that their shorts were smart. So what did these upside down Greek Symbols do? They bet on the outcome of the Chads being right.

Taking a short position that was initially a few billion dollars and sending into val-fucking-halla. Am I saying that this will cause the financial system to collapse? Absolutely no because Jerome Powell hallowed be his name will make the money printer go brrrr. But this is going to correct the system like we've never seen before.

I want to put this out there prior to anything happening in hopes of possibly helping my fellow smooth brains in the event i am correct. If this happens WSB had nothing to do with it the pattern has been forming since before most of you started trading.

After mixed reviews and some interest in my dms, I thought I would put a time table to my theory and possibly earn some Nostradamus style prophetic infamy or go down in a blaze of glory.

I believe SPX/SPY has created the largest three peaks and a dome house chart pattern ever seen. Typically these patterns are seen over a period of months, but, I believe this has been forming for years. I am predicting a severe economic downturn with a depression.

&#x200B;

[SPX current comparison](https://preview.redd.it/jexd28xazre61.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac7b64688498b98ec83c2f57aae10b620d29c7b0)

The above chart shows the current 5 year SPX chart compared to an example of a past three peaks and a dome house pattern. Based on this March was not a crash but a signal of what's to come. As you can see if i am correct this will be the only time in history this pattern has occurred over a timeframe this large. I am not screaming the sky is falling, but facts point to the very likely possibility. 6/10 of the largest market rallies were during the great depression and 2/10 were during the 08 crisis. this is no different.

Timing

&#x200B;

The above is the current spy chart over a 5 year period. I am operating under the theory that in april we entered the deflationary spiral seen in depressions, through fed intervention, stimmys, and other market factors we have yet to see the full brunt. My prediction is that the market will rally a bit over the next 2-3 weeks, and then begin its descent with the large drop coming in 4-6 weeks. This can be affected by an infinite amount of factors which could accelerate or prolong the pattern. According to pattern, we will see new ATH or near it on SPX then we will go down.

&#x200B;

I want to be extremely clear, I am just like you in the worst possible ways. I successfully pattern trade, but i am in no way a professional. This is not financial advice, i am simply sharing something i believe i came across to benefit the retards i love arguing with. Feedback is welcomed and  i look forward to arguing with all of you."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092930.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'WSB', 'WSB', 'I', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'SPY', 'I', 'I', 'SPX', 'SPX', 'I', 'I', 'ATH', 'SPX', 'I', 'I', 'I']|[]

Payrick Byrne, ex ceo of overstock, waged this battle about 15yrs ago. Got called a looney by wall street but fought through it and won some parting gifts. Interestingly, one guy he accused was Steve Cohen. At the time he ran SAC hedgefund (named after him Stephen A Cohen). Eventually got busted for insider trading and had to close shop with only about 10b. Bought the mets and now reopened shop with another hf, Point 42 or something like that. The guy that started Melvin was a SAC prot√©g√© and I think Steve floated them some money on that last bailout. Anyways, might be interesting to parse the past a little and head down the rabbit hole.

Edit: byrne is an interesting fellow. Son of Jack Byrne, former ceo of Geico and a Buffet favorite. Phd in philosophy from Stanford. He walks a fine line btwn sanity and insanity as some of his stories makes him look bat shit crazy. That said, I think he was on the right side of history with his fight against Naked Short Selling

The key thing to note on ~~2~~1/26 and 1/27. There you can see that while shorts *supposedly* closed and became lower the price also dropped at the same time.

This doesn't make sense. Shorts closing *should* mean more shares being bought thus driving the price up.

Note the date. **Wednesday.** This was also happening during the short ladder manipulation. It's more likely that a lot more shares were ""borrowed"" (shorted) from already shorted shares to create that short ladder manipulation, but they weren't disclosed.

I myself have 50 shares at $120.

I‚Äôll get downvoted back to Lumbridge, but there‚Äôs no second thought to go to another brokerage.

#Here‚Äôs my reasons:

1. **The BEST UI out there.** It completely eliminated the learning curve for fundamental training. I started trading in November 2020, and have reaped 200% gains in 3 months. If I had picked a legacy, more complex boomer brokerage, I‚Äôd probably be in boomer ass SPY / VOO type index funds due to being mentally handicapped.
2. **This shit runs deeper than Robinhood.** remember when big guns shorted airplane/defense stocks right before 9/11? Who‚Äôs really in control here? These brokerages limiting trading certain stocks are the puppets being manipulated by some greater master.
3. **Early access to their IPO.** everyone leaving to Fidelity will force their hand to offer a shit ton more shares to users pre-IPO. Let‚Äôs be fucking honest here, this stock is going apeshit to mars. GME is just the current trend. There are new investors everyday and Robinhood will still remain the go-to with its referral incentives and ease-of-use.

Go ahead and crucify me. I just can‚Äôt stand any other UI and RH makes the P&L easy."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092956.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['FUCK', 'I', 'BEST', 'UI', 'I', 'I', 'SPY', 'VOO', 'IPO', 'IPO', 'GME', 'I', 'UI', 'RH', 'L']|['GME']

I know this sub is getting absolutely bombarded with random hot takes and DD‚Äôs, but I‚Äôm hoping this might be an analogy that helps a lot of people understand GME and the squeeze that‚Äôs happening, and will be unique enough to stay. 


If you‚Äôre still struggling to understand the squeeze, shorting and the $GME trends, I‚Äôm here to help. Bear with me. (No, not that bear). 

This is gonna be really oversimplified, but be different than ü¶ç and üçå.

So, imagine a college star, up and coming high draft pick. Most sports are apt for this analogy, but NFL works best. 


This is a QB projected #1 pre-season. He‚Äôs legit. bona-fide, undeniable talent. Let‚Äôs call him Game Stop, (Stop, #69). 

He‚Äôs on a shit team and gets dealt a shit hand for 2020 (bad team + pandemic. Limits games played, falling off the radar). 

Now let‚Äôs a few things happen: 

1.) Someone makes a massive bet that Game Stop is washed, terrible and will never recover, but they have to borrow money to make that bet. They hate the player because they‚Äôre old and resentful and afraid of death, and they want to do everything they can to prevent this young player from succeeding. They want to force them to fail by making everyone else believe they will fail. 

2.) A new head coach gets hired, someone who is absolutely qualified and primed to bring out the absolute best in Game Stop, and revolutionize and evolve their game. 

3.) A random dude on the internet notices how high the bet is against the player, Game Stop. They think to themselves, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôve seen that dude play. His talent is undeniable, and he‚Äôs got the perfect new coach. There is no WAY he‚Äôs gonna be that bad‚Äù. 

4.) This dude let‚Äôs his buddies know about how high the bet against the player, Game Stop, is, and they agree. There is no WAY they‚Äôre that bad, especially with the new coach! There‚Äôs no way this bet can win, this is easy money!

5.) Word about the bet spreads like wildfire. Not only do more and more people do their research and watch game tape and realize how talented the player is, they realize how insane the bet against him is. 

Now, Game Stop (#69) starts to get back on track. They start playing games again and show their potential, their talent. They‚Äôre making a playoff run. Now they‚Äôre gaining more and more attention, and MORE people realize they‚Äôre gonna succeed. 

The original person who bet against the player, who was convinced they were washed, starts to panic. The person they borrowed the money from is starting to see what‚Äôs going on, and starts to ask for the money back. Every game that Game Stop plays, they prove themselves more and more, and the bet against them gets even more spicy. At this point, the bettor borrows even more money and DOUBLES DOWN, stubborn and convinced the player will fail and prove they were right. 

People aren‚Äôt having it. They‚Äôve SEEN the games, they KNOW the talent, there is absolutely no way this player isn‚Äôt legit, no possible way for them to fail. They bet even more in support. They KNOW he‚Äôll succeed, make the playoffs and win the championship and be the #1 pick. 

At this point, the person who bet against him is losing an insane amount of money. There is no way they can pay back the original bet. They‚Äôll be absolutely ruined and embarrassed. Somehow, they have enough power to stop the player from playing games. They take the games off TV, they  delete the highlight videos, they go to the news screaming ‚ÄúThis player is terrible. Trash, washed. Anyone who doesn‚Äôt believe that is delusional, wrong, and will lose a lot of money‚Äù. 
It doesn‚Äôt matter, everyone has already seen the games, the highlights, the talent, with their OWN EYES. It‚Äôs undeniable. The bet is terrible, and the new coach fits perfectly. 

Every single day the bettor doesn‚Äôt cut his losses, the person he borrowed from adds interest to the total they owe. They‚Äôre getting impatient and they see the writing on the wall. BUT, if they wanna continue, that‚Äôs fine, the bettor will just have to pay even more money at the end.


That‚Äôs where we‚Äôre at now. Exactly that. 

All it comes down to now, is all of us believing what we‚Äôve already known, what we‚Äôve already seen. They can take down the videos, they can blackout the media, they can keep them from even playing a game, but it‚Äôs too late. WE‚ÄôVE SEEN IT. WE KNOW. WE KNOW THE TALENT, THE COACH, AND HOW BAD THE BET IS. 

All we have to do is believe in ourselves, and trust in the talent we‚Äôve seen, and stick to our guns about how terrible the bet against the player was. Every moment that goes by, every game they play, the bet gets worse, and our position gets better. 

No matter what, the original better has to call it quits and take their losses, but they will do EVERYTHING they can to make us stumble, falter, fear. To make us doubt ourselves and what we‚Äôve seen, what we know. They can‚Äôt. 


We watched this player in elementary school, in middle school, in high school, and college. They brought us countless moments of joy, and sometimes of sadness. We lost with them, but more importantly, we WON with them. How fucking DARE someone bet against them and their talent, and intentionally try to ruin their career, just out of spite, to make a profit. 

We know this player, we trust this player, we like this player, we believe in this player, and if we hold this player, by fucking God this player and everyone who believed in them, will win. We‚Äôll succeed. 

And that son of a bitch who tried to ruin them? They lose everything.

You leave the theatre that you brought your wife and her ex-boyfriend‚Äôs girlfriend to.

You take out your BlackBerry G1000 and tell SiriQ to drive your wife and her boyfriend home as you head across the street to reminisce about the old life you left behind. You think to yourself *wow* *Siri has gotten 10 times better after BB bought over AAPL and merged Siri with QNX.*

As you enter your previous 9-5 abode, you smirk as you say to yourself¬†*Sir, this is a Wendy‚Äôs.*¬†That joke just never gets old. You immediately recognize the server. You used to hate him but that hatred has now turned to pity.¬†*Ah I‚Äôll throw him a bone*¬†you think to yourself as you give Andrew the secret hand signal to meet you out back for the Wendy‚Äôs Special.

You go out back to your usual spot but notice there‚Äôs a homeless man there sleeping in the dumpster. Andrew then says¬†*It‚Äôs $42,069 for a handie*. Exactly the price of one GME share. Oh god‚Ä¶ has he really not covered his short position yet? After some haggling you managed to get the price down to one silver bar. You take out your other phone, the Nokia G420 SLV Edition as payment but Andrew snatches it away from you. He throws your phone to the man in the dumpster and they both make a run for it. In the darkness you vaguely make up the back of the man‚Äôs shirt which read ‚ÄúMelvin Capital‚Äù.

You shake your head as you take out your BB to tell SiriQ to send aid. Two beams of light descend from the sky and blast Andrew & Melvin.¬†*Impressive*¬†you think to yourself as you witness first hand the power of GothamX, a collaboration between Palantir and SpaceX. GothamX blasted a non-lethal laser developed by Tesla from a SpaceX satellite using the pinpoint accurate latitudes and longitudes provided by Palantir.¬†*What a technological marvel*¬†you think to yourself.

*Perfect timing*. Your self driving Tesla Model G comes back after sending your wife and her ex-boyfriend‚Äôs girlfriend home.

It's fun to pretend that we're making money *and* dEsTrOyInG tHe 1%, but it isn't based in reality.

Yes, some hedge funds are short on GME. Melvin Capital, in particular, is massively fucked. Which is hilarious.

But, who is long? Let's take a look:

>The 10 largest shareholders/owners of GME are:

>- Fidelity Management & Research 13.67% (9,534,090 shares)
>- RC Ventures LLC (Ryan Cohen) 12.91% (9,001,000 shares)
>- BlackRock Institutional 11.32% (7,897,907 shares)
>- The Vanguard Group, Inc.	7.58% (5,288,116)
>- Susquehanna International Group, LLP 6.37% (4,444,128 shares)
>- Dimensional Fund Advisors, L.P. 5.66% (3,948,114 shares)	
>- Senvest Management, LLC 5.18% (3,610,740 shares)	
>- Foss (Donald A) 5.04% (3,515,200 shares)
>- State Street Global Advisors (US) 3.74% (2,609,487 shares)	
>- Sherman George E Jr 3.39% (2,361,670 shares)

That right there is 75% ownership. And if you looked at the next top 10 investors, it would be more wealthy investors and hedge funds.
 
Of course, not all of these are hedge funds and 1% investors. Some are mutual funds (i.e Fidelity and Vanguard), so some of these shares are ""owned"" by the working/middle class in various retirement accounts and similar. But, it's pretty obvious, as *all companies are majority owned by the 1% and hedge funds.* That's how it works. 

It's impossible to know exactly what % is owned by retail investors/redditors in brokerage accounts, but it's obvious that it's a tiny, tiny portion.

So, what happens we we boost GME? Well, Melvin Capital gets fucked (again, hilarious), and their wealth is essentially transferred to those who own GME shares. Which is... mostly other hedge funds and wealthy investors. So, we're not transferring wealth from the rich to the poor, we're transferring wealth from rich fucks to... other rich fucks.

And, sure, redditors are skimming a little off the top, and that's great, but it's not a notable amount, in the grand scheme of things. And, if GME crashes, it's gonna be redditors who hold the bags, and the hedge funds will win again (more than they already are).

So, what's my point? Is it to shit on a movement? Am I a CoRpArAtE sHiLl sent by a melvin bro to knock down the stock? No (I wish). 

My point is this: whenever some bad news or fake news comes out about GME (i.e. when it was falsely reported that Melvin exited), everyone was 100% sure it is manipulation by Melvin Capital (and the wall street bros). And, it probably was.

But, when some good news comes out (like how we're DESTROYING THE 1% or a billboard in times square), absolutely *no one* considers the possibility that the hedge funds and 1% investors that own gamestop are trying to trick you into buying GME shares. And that's dangerous.

This movement has caused millions of brand new investors to make robinhood accounts and buy GME shares, and *they don't know what they are doing.* They believe that pumping a stock owned by the 1% is somehow a moral battle against the rich, because everyone is telling them so. That's not only wrong, it's also dangerous.

So, go ahead and downvote me, idgaf. Facts are facts, and I advice new traders to not *only* consider downward manipulation, but to also consider upward manipulation.

EDIT 2: Everyone commenting emotionally charged oppositions to my opinion, please post proof of your current GME cost basis with your angry comment.

#Why is every bearish speculative view on GME now considered Melvin propoganda? Check my fucking post history, dipshits. I'm allowed to have a bearish short term outlook for a stock that I'm long term bullish on especially when my initial cost basis is probably 1/10 what yours is.

1. Constantly moving price targets alone is a huge indicator that were topping a crest.  In the last 1 month I've seen the price target move from $240-$500 to a ""serious"" $10,000/shr..

2. This sub is FILLED with emotional trading which is the complete opposite of what WSB was founded on. It's all about the money and it's ALWAYS been all about the money. Cry me a river about unfairness... The market was ""rigged"" when the money printers were going brrrrr back in may and WSB was made up of 90% people WHO WERE SHORTING THE ENTIRE ECONOMY.

3. The amount of people with outdated news at this stage in the game will show you who the bagholders will be. They weren't quick enough to jump on the band wagon at $40/shr, what makes them think they'll be able to perfectly time a single (or half) day event?

4. Mr. Shrek (the one and only posterchild and ACTUAL WSB mod) is short term bearish on GME and doesn't even hold a position. And he's locked up and talking through a contact. That should tell you something about the current bagholders.

TL;DR don't be a shoe shine boy. There's a psychological reason that the ones who are slowest to jump aboard are the ones left holding the bag.

John Galt, if you're out there, I'm waiting for my invite.

The hedgefund guys are billionares. If there's one thing they know how to do, it's make money with legal/illegal/immoral practices. If you're not willing to stoop to that level, then you're at a disadvantage.

***I think*** we're in the greater fool stage. Maybe you'll be able to sell if the stock opens at $500 OR maybe you'll eat shit if it gaps down to $200. Either way, you need a plan, and that plan should not include the word ""hope"". What gain/loss are you willing to take; whats the mathematical probability that will happen; and what are you going to do about it whichever way it goes?.

Your broker will sell those shares for you swiftly and that is perfectly legal. This could cause GME to fall quite a bit since the gamma squeeze was the result of MMs having to buy those shares you now own and are being forced to sell.

Hello silver surfers, clang gang, and monkeys who enjoy shiny things

Thank you for helping [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the_real_dd_on_slv_the_worlds_biggest_short/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) go viral and make it on Zerohedge (dreams fulfilled).

Before I get GME hate mail, let me clarify I am still long GME and am looking for the moon in GME.  I also have a small long silver position.  Both positions are quite small as I am unfortunately not super well capitalized.  Many of the comments about buys on the previous post referenced order sizes I can only dream of at the moment, but I'm damn glad we have so much conviction behind this trade.

I created an official [Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/Thehappyhawaii1/status/1355663208774836228?s=20). Not sure if I‚Äôll use it, but didn‚Äôt want anyone to impersonate me.

Clang gang acted so fast, that all the bullion dealers sold out over the weekend which is incredible, and overnight futures are spiking as we speak.  I continue to support the purchase of physical silver as a way to continue the short squeeze if you can find any of course.  The short squeeze thesis is built upon tying up as much of the physical silver into our diamond hands as possible.  With that said, I thought I would add some clarity to my position on the various options out there to play the silver squeeze.

**It is organized into 2 sections:**

**1. the futures market (for big players)**

**2. alternatives (for smaller players**)

&#x200B;

**1.**

**The futures market:** for the squeeze to really happen, we desperately need some of the bigger pocketed players who have access to the futures market to purchase silver contracts on the open market.  **If you can play in the futures market, it is imperative that you do so.**  I have been trying to find a retail broker who will allow customers to take physical delivery rather than force cash settlement but have had no luck so far.  If anyone knows of such a retail broker, please let me know so I can update the post with the info.  This is by far the most important piece of the short squeeze equation.

Let me explain:

When traders hold long futures contracts to expiration, they are making a statement that they want to take delivery.  Taking delivery does not mean the silver is transferred to your house, but rather it goes to the CME warehouse.  You can go pick it up from the warehouse or arrange transfer, or you can pay $8.50 a month per 1000 ounces to just store it at the warehouse (which is quite cheap at that scale).  The futures market allows players to use extreme amounts of margin and leverage, which is where the 'naked shorts' come from.  They are able to sell massive amounts of silver with very little collateral to back it up, and no actual silver on hand.  **This also explains why institutions such as citadel or others hold positions in the ETFs like SLV.** If you have more than 50,000 shares in SLV, you can request to have your share of the silver delivered to you.  They are hedging against their naked shorts in the futures market by trying to gain access to a source of silver should they need it.  The thing is, if the short squeeze occurs, even their holdings in SLV will not be enough to meet their obligations.

In order for the buyers to call their bluff they need to not use their margin power, as tempting as it may be to do so.  They need to only purchase as much silver in the futures market as they actually have money in their account to cover the final purchase (the price is locked in at the time of the futures contract purchase).  Then as expiration approaches, refuse to settle in cash, and pony up the money to actually buy the silver and have it delivered.  At that time the seller needs to find silver fast, and tries to purchase it from somewhere else to meet their contractual obligations.  The rush of all the naked shorts to try and find physical silver is what massively drives up the price and causes the short squeeze.

There may even be dips in the futures market if the buyers are planning to do the squeeze.  This is because they will not be using margin whiles the seller are.  The sellers may be able to push the price down temporarily, but when expiration comes they will find themselves in one hell of a bind when they find out all of the buyers actually have the cash in their accounts to take delivery and refuse to settle in cash.

As the supply of silver dries up and literally there is no way to fulfill the obligations of the long contract holders, the silver futures market will actually be effectively shut down.  The CME will force settle all remaining contracts for cash at the current market rate (which will have spiked dramatically).  This is the last thing the CME wants to do, and will only do it as a final last resort.  If this occurs we can declare victory at having exposed the silver futures market for the fraud that it is.  A futures market is built on the trust that the sellers can actually deliver the product they are selling, and if they can't then that trust is destroyed.  If you go long and they don't have the silver to give you, you will still be paid the money for that amount of silver at the going rate.

Following this collapse the futures market will relaunch at a 1-1 margin requirement.  This means that for every silver ounce sold, the seller will actually have to have the silver or at least the collateral to cover that exact amount of silver on the open market.  The futures market will have moved from 250-1 paper to physical, to 1-1.  The massive banks who were naked short will have lost tens or maybe even hundreds of billions of dollars collectively.  In my previous post I implied it was likely JP Morgan naked shorting.  They have a history of doing so and being fined for manipulation, but we don't actually know which big players are the current naked shorts and who might even be net long.

**2.**

**This is where the rest of us come in...** if you can't play the futures market, you can still purchase and tie up physical silver where the naked shorts can't access it.  Thus setting up the environment for the squeeze to occur.  Whether its WSB players or some other big fund who sees what is happening and does the futures part themselves, they will only be able to do so because of the smaller purchases of silver by millions of smaller players.

**Physical silver:** by purchasing physical silver you are taking silver off the market that the shorts will need when the squeeze occurs.  You aren't directly causing the short squeeze, you are helping to set up the environment for the squeeze to occur, and you will have the silver to sell after the squeeze happens.

**Silver ETFs (SLV, PSLV, SIVR):** this is the same concept as the physical silver.  By purchasing silver ETFs you are locking up physical into the ETF's vaults, which wont be able to be able to be purchased by the shorts in the futures market because they belong to the ETF shareholders.  There has been a ton of chatter about whether ETFs should be used at all, and of the ETFs which is the best or most reliable.  Frankly if you have doubts about the ETFs, just don't use them.  All of the physical silver is already sold out so this is the easiest way for most people to play at this point.  If you prefer physical but it‚Äôs sold out or selling for ridiculous premiums, just buy the ETFs until the premiums come down and then sell the ETF to purchase more physical. It is possible that at some point SLV (or other ETFs) will no longer create new shares as silver becomes impossible to find (thus they cant create a new share because they can't the silver to back it up).   At that point the ETFs will likely trade at a hefty premium to NAV and it may no longer make sense to purchase them.  But that hasn't occurred yet so I'd say it still certainly makes sense to buy these ETFs.  We have no proof that they are lying about their silver holdings, and if they disallow new share creation, I'd say that means they really aren't lying about their holdings, otherwise they would happily take as much investment as we would give them to collect management fees.

**Call options on Silver ETFs:** Calls will have a similar effect to purchasing the ETFs as the market maker will have to purchase the underlying ETF to be hedged.  It has a levered effect that can both hurt and help the squeeze depending on which direction the silver price is headed.

**Miners:** miners will benefit from the squeeze but buying them doesn't help the squeeze occur in any direct way.  People buying miners will benefit if we are successful, but the more capital that flows into them rather than the alternatives, it will lower the chances of the squeeze being successful in the first place.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

**if monke have lot of money, long futures with no margin and take delivery.**

**If monke not have lot of money, buy physical silver bullion and silver ETFs**

Hopefully this answered some of the questions that flooded my inbox from the previous post.  Good luck to all.  GME and SLV to moon.  Lets squeeze the naked shorts, expose the manipulation, and take our tendies from the hedge funds.

She was born in the late 1950s. Ergo, Boomer.

Needless to say the topic of $GME came up.

Her words, ""Oh, that's where a bunch of internet individuals are trying to artificially drive the price of a stock up to create a boom and bust""

Before I had an aneurysm and went full baby ü¶ç on her, I calmed myself. She has been fed by the MM bought media.

I asked her to explain and she tried to turn CrookNetworkBoughtConversation on to show me. After some discussion and challenging her facts, it was obvious she was simply uninformed and had no reason to mistrust the network.

We must get ahead of this narrative in the most accessible way possible. Real life conversation. The younger generations do not own the media networks (yet) and the age distribution in congress is overwhelmingly elder.

###If we do not get ahead of this narrative through word of mouth, we will be blamed for the next decade. 



**TL;DR Older ü¶ç think this is younger ü¶ç fault. Smashing üçåüçå and getting angry will only reinforce this view. Young ü¶ç must share üçå with older apes and calmly reject the narrative. We must preemptively challenge the narrative with everyone we can to get ahead of the shit storm. $GME to Uranus ü™êü™êü™ê**



###Edit : To better explain why the narrative matters, the concern is regulation and financial sector terms of service.

It is sad that Robinhood has had multiple outages in the past, not allowing any users to trade. 
It is embarrassing and frustrating that they took money from Citadel and are protecting them by limiting your trades, even with trades for GM and SBUX !!!! 

The only thing that is good about Robinhood is that it enforced the brokerage game to revolutionize with zero fee commission and allowing the opportunity to buy portions of stocks. 

I‚Äôve been with Schwab for years, and it has the same features Robinhood has now. Yea, sure the app isn‚Äôt as pleasing as Robinhood‚Äôs but Schwab offers their insight and research on stocks. I‚Äôve heard that Robinhood charges for research, but correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. 

Also Robinhood did not disclose the fact they were selling order flow until they got caught and are being sued.
I hope that all of you Robinhood traders sue Robinhood for everything from outages, to selling order flow and to the latest restrictions.

Here‚Äôs another interesting fact. Wsb‚Äôs performance astronomically improved when the sub grew bigger.

1. Regardless if GME moons or fucking tanks, OG WSBers will sell for profit. Maybe not all of their shares but enough to lock in a good profit because that is what WSB is actually about. Finding good trades and making some damn good money or finding retarded trades and losing it all. 

2.  After that, GAINS PORN. 

3.  Next, all the new accounts who have joined during this crazy fun time who were actually in this ‚Äúfor a reason‚Äù will realize that they were the bag holders who got screwed the most by this trade and will turn on WSB because they had no idea what they were getting themselves into when joining this sub. 

4. They all leave this group. We go down to hopefully 2M or less in this sub and we go back to the normal retardation that we all know and love.

I apologize for wasting others time and space.

Background: MBA w/+20 years including stints in Investment Banking, Equity Research, VC and Corporate. ( = I know enough to be dangerous.)

**Should I invest tomorrow?**

I would invest with the understanding that you're playing a high risk/high reward game vs. the best on Wall Street (WS) who aren't accustomed to losing. (Hell, you put a 50% dent in one of the most high profile HFs on the Street.)  Reddit/WSB (WSB) is beating WS at its own game and WS will not accept that. The reason that I would still buy shares is because I'm perfectly comfortable waiting out the shorts, who I believe didn't cover entirely based on some sketchy trading volumes and price action on Thursday known as ladder attacks, which is basically artificially lowering a security's price by selling it back and forth between two parties. (Note: the WSJ is reporting that Melvin closed their positions at a loss of 50% to the fund. Maybe they did, though I don‚Äôt trust Melvin or the WSJ. Regardless, I have no doubt that other HFs are salivating at the short opportunity given where GME shares are currently trading.)

**The key is the somewhat unreliable short data which comes out next week.** As I mentioned in a previous post, getting accurate short data is next to impossible. It makes polling data look flawless by way of comparison. It has gotten to the point that I don't believe anything I read because there is not only time lag but synthetic longs and ladder attacks all of which serve to obscure the data. No firm wants it positions known so there is a strong incentive to obscure/hide the data. Another reason why Melvin publicly releasing its positions is just highly unusual/odd.

I would also be aware that a lot of HFs are making bank off the GME volatility by selling options and taking long positions. Just look at [r/thetagang](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/). The group is making their entire investment decisions based solely on the option premium without any concern for the underlying narrative to the point where they're short GME puts at the 200 strike. (And they think WSB is full of retards!)

To use an analogy, I'm a lifelong Giants fan who put a $1,000 down on the Giants beating the Pats in the 2008 Superbowl. The Pats went undefeated all season and the Giants entered the playoffs as a wildcard. The bookie even told me when I placed the bet that I was just throwing away my money. I bet the money line, i.e., no points, and ending up winning $5,000. The bookie just smiled at me when I handed him my ticket. Sometimes you just gotta trust your gut and stay loyal to your instincts no matter what others think. It's what separates the men from the boys.

TLDR: It‚Äôs a clich√©, but don‚Äôt invest in GME what you can‚Äôt afford to lose. At this point, you're going against some very powerful hedge funds, i.e., the Pats in 2008. That said, WSB already scored a very impressive victory and is retarded enough to not realize how good their competition really is (just like the Giants in the Super Bowl).

**How will the media portray the narrative?**

The media have already started spreading the narrative that WSB is going to cause a financial collapse rather than the true culprits, namely, the HFs which leveraged up 5x to short 120% of a company's shares outstanding setting the stage for an infinity squeeze, which is the financial equivalent of a nuclear chain reaction.  I mention this because the greatest risk IMHO is government intervention to quell the markets when the HFs start unloading positions to meet margin calls and borrowing costs. Nobody will lose sleep over a few billionaires losing a few commas in their net worth but hitting 401Ks, pension funds, and endowments is a different story. The official narrative will involve large commercial banks which loaned Melvin and other HFs billions to leveraged up with. These banks are regulated by the SEC and FDIC because they hold commercial deposits. When the narrative shifts from Melvin and HFs to names you recognize, e.g., JPM, BofA, Citi, rest assured the game is almost up. My guess is we're in the seventh or eighth inning of this game before it's stopped.

When people ask me about WSB I first discuss the HFs who created the conditions and then secondly note that thankfully we're dealing with a relatively small company in GME with a market cap of $20bn (so far!) compared to a company in the S&P 500, which is the basis for index funds and portfolio construction. In short, WSB did everyone a favor by calling attention to such a disastrous scenario in as optimal circumstances as possible. We should be very thankful WSB alerted the public to a systematic flaw in the financial system before a much greater meltdown occurred.

TLDR: The media are the PR firms for Wall Street. They exist to promote a narrative and receive access and compensation in return. They have no interest in reporting how the retail investor is being swindled. In contrast WSB did everyone a favor by pointing out a very serious systematic flaw in as optimal fashion as possible. This is the truth and the message that needs to be heard.

**What‚Äôs the next step?**

FINRA releases short data next Tuesday, February 9th for the period ending this past Friday, January 29th. Roughly 700mn GME shares changed hands last week or 10x the total shares outstanding so I'm pretty sure the short interest (SI) has fallen below 100%. However, I expect it to still be well above 50% given the typical HF‚Äôs risk appetite by which I mean they expect the retail investors to run for the exits sending shares back to $20-ish levels. I would love to know the borrowing costs for these firms because it basically tells you how long they can wait before such costs negatively impact their returns. My guess is until March when they have to report 1Q results to investors.

TLDR: Short data will show a decrease in SI, which is not necessarily a bad thing but it‚Äôs important to note that the risk/reward profile of the trade has moved.

**How much good did this GME trade really do besides transfer a lot of wealth?**

A heck of alot. At a minimum, WSB drew well needed scrutiny to the role of option clearings firms such as Citadel\* and Wolverine, i.e., the shadow economy, and their dual roles as market makers and hedge funds (players and referees). This screams conflict of interest. A revolution doesn‚Äôt happen overnight but this is another step forward in demonstrating how rigged the game is against the retail investor and guy in the (Main) street. Our regulatory agencies exist to enforce transparency and fairness. WSB has demonstrated that the derivatives market and particularly short selling lack both and have the capability to cause a financial panic. And of course, there is the unbelievable amount of charitable donations from WSB gains which prove who the real Robinhood is. (Sorry, couldn‚Äôt resist).

* Citadel alone handles more than 25% of US equity flow. The company is a monster and barely anyone knows it exists, which is how they like it. They tell Wall Street what the regulation is and they pay Washington to enforce it. Former Fed heads Bernanke and Yellen have received almost a million in combined comp for speeches and advisory services from Citadel. In short, Citadel makes Goldman look like the United Way. And oh, yeah, 40% of Robinhood's revenue comes from Citadel in return for order flow. Assume what you will.

TLDR: Sunlight is the best disinfectant ‚Äì Justice Brandeis

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

For the questions below and messages:

As I tried to communicate in the write-up, I would characterize the trade as more risky than a week ago when the SI was above 100%. I have no doubt many shorts have since closed. That said, I suspect the SI is still well above 50% given where the stock is and typical HF risk appetite. This is not a trade for your parents or grandparents.\* There is serious risk here that the share price collapses based on who the counterparties are and the lower SI. That said, I still like it and I'm in it. IMHO, it comes down to a game of chicken in the sense of who is willing to hold longer. HFs have investors to report to in 1Q vs. WSB who have bills, rent, and life to deal with. As my old coach would say, who wants it more.

* The market has returned \~11% per year for the past decade. A good HF aims for 2x that. You guys are banking +1,000% returns on a trade lasting approximately a month against the best HFs on the Street. These returns are not normal or even within several standard deviations. They are clearly not for the faint-of-heart. We are in unchartered waters here. No shame in heading back. The fact you've come this far is simply amazing. Even you wife's boyfriend would be proud of you.

Keith Gill took the time and educated himself on GameStop‚Äôs position. 
Keith saw that GameStop was highly undervalued. He saw that they have more cash on the balance sheet and that the market cap was less than the amount of cash on the balance sheet. 
Keith researched about consumers spending habits on physical vs digital consoles and games. Also on physical games vs physical movies and physical music copies. 
Keith saw that GameStop has potential to make a lot of money on the new Xbox and PlayStation consoles.

The TD ameritrade % held by institutions changed today...to 112.39%... which is an odd number because that would mean that there is 71-72 million share. However there are only 69.7M shares. Me being the autist I am, I checked for SEC filings which I couldn't find anything as of friday. Used a calculator (its that weird thing with number buttons) to count each institutions holdings and it checked out to the reported number. 

I'm not claiming that I'm smart, in fact I'm a dumbass who made most of his gains off of TLSA. However, and this is a big however, unless I am even dumber then I think I am, there can not be more than 100% of a companies shares. This means that EVEN THE INSTITUTIONS ARE HOLDING ARTIFICIAL SHARES. 

Again the if comes in, if I'm not a total dumbass, it means that just the institutions have the ability to diamond hand this bitch into infinity.  

So overall where does this leave the retards and autists and fomoers. Well, I don't fucking know. Some how this situation has to fix itself, if the government steps in we might get fucked. GME could step in and we get fucked. OR the free market resolves itself and we all go to uranus where there is a special tendie town built for gmetards.

I am not a financial advisor, nothing I say holds any weight, I'm just an idiot who noticed an oddity in some percentages.

The next space is for the big investors in gme see other posts if you want to know who they are and the company itself they will benefit most if shorts cover into moass.

I basically was a üíéüôå. Until the day some you were able to change my mindset into selling those shares.     
[this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/khkqvn/question_about_entering_full_panic_mode/) was my first post on here, in December.    
I was laughed at for wanting to hold my GME shares, I was new into trading and that was enough to make me believe I was doing wrong.

That was when the price was at ~17. About the title, I wish I knew about market manipulators so that I could know what was actually going on with GME. I wish I knew what DFV thought about GME so to don't feel all alone into being a üíéüôå.

But this historical time is also slowly turning into a hysterical time. 


I wanted to put forth a few questions. There are no answers here as answers would be different for everyone. All i ask is that you consider these questions:


1. Everyone who is waiting for monday to buy AMC in the hope of GME like short squeeze: what is the biggest enemy of a short squeeze? More available shares to buy rights? AMC just did another stock offering and diluted its shares. What makes you think it will still fly like GME?


2. Everyone who is wishing death to robinhood and move to fidelity and orher brokers. Do you remember pre-robinhood times and do you think brokers would have ever made trading free on their own? Hell, do you think this 'revolution' would have been possible without Robinhood in first place? What stops bigger broker go back to $5 per trade fee once Robinhood (and now webull) are dead?


3. Everyone who is pushing SLV. Do you know who are the biggest holders of SLV? Do you seriously believe retail investors would benefit?

We're in uncharted territory here and are witnessing a short squeeze which has never been seen before. We also don't have retrospect to show us what really happened as it all played out.

But we can look to the fabled Volkswagen short squeeze a while ago. I don't care about short interest or float or whatever: Volkswagen became the biggest company in the world at that time due to a short squeeze. If we consider market cap alone, how high can GME go?

Let's use 1 trillion as a nice round number. Sure there are companies with larger caps, but fuck I don't want to complicate things. GME (according to corrupt-as-fuck Robinhood) has a cap of 17 billion. Divide 1 trillion by this and we get the number 57. GME has to go up 57 times it's current price to be a trillion dollar company. 

330*57 is about $19,000 per share. If this squeeze played out like VW back in the day, we can look forward to at least this target. I could be wrong, I could be retarded, but this is what the math is pointing to if history somewhat repeats itself.

TL:DR: Buy and hold GameStop with üíé ‚úã.

I get it- you guys were here already. You have a culture and you enjoy being part of this community. Suddenly, every dingus from all four corners of the Internet is coming up in here, going ""what's a stonk?!"" and ""should I buy a 15c GME for next year?"" and ""my boomer dad told me to invest in ETFs should I do it?""

It's annoying. Your sub has been completely derailed by the GME mania, and for what it's worth, this moron appreciates those who have taken the time to share their knowledge. I have, no shit, learned more about finances and economics in the last week than I have in my entire life. 

This isn't /r/investing. People should not be coming here for advice. So thanks for putting up with the noobs, and even having the decency to remind people that GME is a once-in-a-lifetime event, and that if they make enough for a extra large tendies meal with extra dipping sauce this time, they may just as easily lose it all on the next outrageous OTM call that they're scheming up.

You probably didn't ever imagine it would happen, but you have most likely shown thousands or even millions of young people all over the world how to access and understand the stock market, which is going to promote financial literacy on a level that we haven't seen before outside of the rich and elite.

I'm not just holding GME for maximum tendies and a trip 'round the moon, I'm doing it because I like the stock- and I learned all about this wonderful stock right here.

Anyway, here what I think these sneaky fuckers did:

Let‚Äôs say Melvbitch is short 100 shares. He needs to get 100 shares somehow to close this position to make it look like he got out of his short, but how does he get them? Calls. 

So, he buys a $0.5 1/29 call and exercises it (we will assume that SIG actually has the shares, so this doesn‚Äôt trigger a gamma squeeze). But, he needs money to buy and exercise this bad boy, and where does he get that? Calls again. 

So, he sells 4-5 (based on what I am seeing value wise) OTM calls to get this money. This maintains his short position whilst making it appear that he is no longer short SHARES. He can also spread to the news that he closed a short position. 

If these OTM calls that he sold them expire OTM, he wins and gets out of the short basically. 

But no, thanks to the norse legend himself and all of you diamond handed autists, those bad boys expired ITM on Friday. Did Melvbitch have the shares for when these options got exercised, no. Did he get assigned them and is therefore still short despite making it appear that he is out? Yes. Now this fucker has to buy even more shares than he originally owed. 

Tldr: if I am correct, the S3 data is missing the options fuckery that they performed last week and they still have to buy hella shares.

What does their future look like?: What's the ""New Normal"" after COVID? We see streaming services up, Movie studios are fighting to go direct. I mean how much longer can theaters run a profit YoY with the current climate? Am I underestimating the vaccine? The luxury of a night out?

Opinion: Seems like they owe a ton of money, their weak profits are spent mostly paying back interest on loans, and the cash they have is spent barely keeping them afloat.

I Need other opinions here to add to this info because Shorts are starting to look good right about now."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092956.csv|StockTicker|['AMC', 'I']|['AMC']|['I', 'I', 'COVID', 'I', 'Y', 'I', 'I']|[]

Those GME open letters made me cry harder than when I lost my Velcro shoes. But I ask you to once more strap on that propeller hat, crack a juice box and really  hear me out. You are my brothers and I don‚Äôt want you to get caught in the crossfire. 

What‚Äôs the big deal?
So it turns out that us glue eaters are an absolute force to be reckoned with when acting in unison. But this short squeeze is so powerful, we have the potential to inadvertently set off an insolvency bomb that will put a hell of a dent in the market. You might already be scratching your head but allow me to explain. 

Hedge funds are feeling the pain. If this squeeze happens like we hope, these guys will be margin called. This is happening at a time when we‚Äôve already been looking at a record Call/put ratio for months. The reason that matters is because these institutions that have been selling you guys all these calls have to buy shares to decrease risk when they sell you those calls. They‚Äôre sitting on a huge stockpile of shares all across the board at a time when no one has cash. 

Why does no one want cash?
Cash is and has been the worst thing to hold since the housing bubble. To put it plainly, the fed lies to us about the true rate of inflation with something called the Consumer Price Index. They do that because if they told the truth, the government would be required to compensate for the increased inflation when they administer social security. It‚Äôs a story for another time but just understand that our assets (stocks,houses,whatever) are not necessarily increasing in value even though it looks like it. Your buying power is decreasing because of the quantitative easing that‚Äôs been happening since the housing crisis. So cash has been a guaranteed loser to hold for a long time. That‚Äôs especially true for our current situation with the absolutely ape shit printing. You might not see it in your milk price right away but you can bet your sweet ass that all those corporate bonds being bought are allowing these companies to buy back their own shares and artificially send their stock price flying. So nobody likes holding cash right now. Not you, not mutual funds, not sovereign powers. 

Why is this so bad and why should I care?
Well nobody is sitting on cash reserves, including the hedge funds you‚Äôre blowing up. When volatility increases, they HAVE to decrease risk and you Velcro assassins are sending volatility to the moon along with the rest of the retail crowd. They are going to have to liquidate a massive amount of shares from the stockpiles they‚Äôve been accumulating just to avoid getting margin called. Or they need to get cash that no one really has available to lend them. If the mother of all short squeezes happens, we could see a wild scramble for dollars since we are in the midst of the biggest credit bubble imaginable. They‚Äôll all need it because insolvency will be knocking on the door and no one wants to be the one with a shit ton of debt when it all goes south. 

What should I do?
Continue your crusade but please please have a hedge. Buy a few UUP calls. They‚Äôre dirt cheap and if shit hits the fan like last March, they‚Äôll at least 5-10x. In my opinion it‚Äôs the best way I know to have an inexpensive long dollar ace in the hole. Or buy cheap puts. In fact, let me know if you have a great idea for cheap puts. I‚Äôm sorry if this isn‚Äôt the best explanation. Just wanted to get it out fast before market open. 

TLDR: You‚Äôre my glue eating brothers in arms and I‚Äôm trying to watch your back. Buy a few cheap UUP calls as a hedge and keep giving those hedge funds hell. 
Good luck my brothers.
Edit: holy shit you guys. I‚Äôm not telling you to stop buying GME. I‚Äôm telling you to get a cheap hedge."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092956.csv|StockTicker|['I', 'BEG', 'UUP']|[]|['I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'HAVE', 'I', 'UUP', 'I', 'UUP', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME']

It‚Äôs hard enough, if not impossible for them to cover their short positions on GME and these hedge funds are, for the most part also attempting to short AMC. 

Seems logical that if you‚Äôre priced out of GME or maxed out of shares and calls you‚Äôre able to buy (depending on what brokerage firm you‚Äôre using) you dump what you can into AMC üöÄüåï as well and HOLD üôåüèªüíé all positions.

No needing to wait days for them to transfer it to your bank. 

I can then use the funds to purchase stock WeBull or another platform. Obviously, you have to sell stock to access your capital so I wouldn‚Äôt use this method for the money invested in AMC and GME.

**Thesis:**  
With the advent of online gaming and e-sport, Gamestop is prime to make a turnaround and grow again assuming it will change direction and adapt post Covid. The support of Ryan Cohen, a e-commerce marketing guru, has brought hope to a once-beloved brand and ignited the flame of this reality.  The stock is also enticing because of its 138% short interest which is the highest percentage in the market. Thus, a remote chance of a short squeeze could occur. *Majority of investors do actually believe in the company and is not in it for  just the short squeeze opportunity. *    
&nbsp;

--  
**Background:**  
Gamestop was once the most prolific gaming retailer in the brick and mortar time period. They made their profits by rebuying used games/gaming paraphernalia at low prices and marking them up greatly. They relied mainly on foot traffic due to a subpar online presence and they were slow to change. The low price and convenience of online shopping had won over shoppers causing the demise of brick and mortar. Large brands started disappearing left and right and now it was Gamestop's turn with a boost from Covid. Investors wrote GameStop off as a dinosaur company with its shares eventually dropping to $2.5 dollar.

--  
**Results:**   
Hedge funds saw this and decided to go short on them, betting on their demise like all the others. The funds abused the mechanism of the market to cause a large selling pressure onto the stock, forcing the stock price down and accelerating the demise. Could this be manipulation? If a hedge fund were to short a company out of spite, they could very possibly bankrupt a company.  

--  
**How did Gamestop survive for so long?**  
Even though they weren't raking in e-commerce profit, they were still profitable. It was just that that profit stream was shrinking. The profits were also concentrated at a fraction of their stores. As they closed unprofitable stores, they were able to offset cost slightly. Investors were also holding on to the imminent release of the new console super cycle. Investors noted that the golden days were right after the new consoles were released and Dec 2020 couldn't come quicker. Gamestop was patience and managed their financials well with a strong balance sheet. Investors had underpriced the real estate of theirs. They were not valued for growth anymore so they weren't in a situation to raise capital risk free. They have several billions in short-term and long-term debt but  they had 600 million cash in hand to cushion with. Lastly, the Nintendo switch had just came out and was the best selling gaming console ever. Gamestop rode the tailend of Nintendo success all through 2020 with Switch sales offsetting losses in the other gaming segments.

--  
**The turnaround:**  
A new management team had join in August 2019 that set to slim down the company. They were much more aggressive and sought to aggressively close stores. A comprehensive turnaround plan called GameStop ReBoot  was announced with 4 elements:   
  
1. Optimized the Core Business  
	Reducing unprofitable stores and focusing on what works  
2. Become the Social / Cultural Hub for Gaming  
	Turning Gamestop into a experience center and not just a store  
3. Build a Frictionless Digital Ecosystem  
	Revamp the supply chain to be e-commerce focused  
4. Transform Vendor Partnership  
	Rekindle and make new partnerships   
  
Like all new managements, this one needed time but unfortunately Covid complicated the plans. Investors became increasingly doubtful and even bearish. However, they had underestimated the future of gaming. 

--  
The first significant move was bringing Reginald Fils-Aim√© onto the board of directors. Reginald was known for his market prowess bring Nintendo to what it is today. Investors loved that. 

--  
As Covid happened, working from home and home entertainment exploded. Logitech, Corsair, Bestbuy exploded. Online gaming was projected to be very ludicrous in the next decade and Covid had shorten this timeline. Online gaming took off. Activision, Electronic Arts, Zynga, Tencent all exploded. Apple app revenue from their gaming segment exploded. Investors had repriced these stocks higher taking advantage of the first player advantage. One notable company that changed in valuation was Logitech, they were a value company but relabeled to growth. What was missing from this list was Gamestop. The bullishness in gaming was there and everyone else profited. If there was hope of a GME turnaround, their valuation model would certainly flip to a growth model at higher PE multiples. It was only fair.    

--  
The next big event that occurred  was in October 2020. Gamestop announced a partnership with Microsoft which was the first real tangible milestone on the turnaround plan. Investors started to give the company a second look.  Microsoft Partnership caused shares to rally 30% in a day. A bullish sign that the big players haven't given up. However this was short lived as shorts continue to drive the price down as there was no concrete details on the revenue sharing partnership, only that ""for every Microsoft Xbox console that GameStop sells going forward, GameStop will get some percentage of the revenue from every digital full game download, DLC, microtransaction, and any subscriptions as well."" To me this sounds very bullish that Microsoft still believes in Gamestop.  
 
--  
Next came news that the well-respected businessmen Ryan Cohen released that he had bought up 13% of Gamestop shares, becoming a minority owner. Ryan Cohen was the founder of Chewy, a Petsmart online branch that outcompeted Amazon. Investors labeled him an e-commerce guru/genius. He had bought shares at $4.81 and slowly gobbled up more as the price increased. Rumors started speculating that Cohen would takeover and transform Gamestop and it was materialized when Cohen sent the management a very aggressive letter.  

--  
""GameStop‚Äôs leadership should immediately conduct a strategic review of the business and share a credible plan for seizing the tremendous opportunities in the rapidly-growing gaming sector. GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences ‚Äì not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem.""  

--  
It was a do this or else there will be a hostile takeover. The letter was sent three weeks before Q3 Earnings and investors were now watching intensively for details of a roadmap or of a Cohen reference during the earning call. ER came around and management was mute beside the announcement of a shelf offering of 100mil. Company performance wise, they were negative on profit but had still beaten expectations. The expedited closure of unprofitable of the stores helped. The stock would have soared had not an offering been announce (offering dilutes shares) so instead GME dropped 17%. From the conference calls, many bull investors felt reluctantly weary of this turnaround while some even dismissed management consideration of Ryan and piled on to the shorts. A week later, a filing by Ryan Cohen showed that he had continued to believe that the stock was undervalued and bought even at $14.83. This news rekindled the speculation that Ryan Cohen was going to do a takeover. Stock bounced and soared to $22.35 dollars for the next few weeks before dropping to $17.35.    

--  
**Jan 2021 - The first squeeze:**  
Shorts were still convinced that Gamestop would not be turn around and so they held steady with a short interest above 130%. Some short sellers had left while new ones piled on.    

--  
Monday, Jan 11th, Gamestop decided to drop bombs to the short:  
- First with an announcement that there was 309% increase in e-commerce sales from 2019 holiday season, 4.8% increase in comparable store sales, 3.1% decrease in total sales.  
	- The biggest takeaway was that their new e-commerce strategy was working. 309% increase is massive. Also this followed their original plan to concentrate on their core. Rise in sales of profitable store was also shown. The closure unprofitable stores hit their total sales but it was not much and implied that these stores were dead weight. They slimmed their bleeding cost segment and increased their profit. This was super bullish.  
- Secondly, a board of advisor switch up was announced. Ryan Cohen and two main Chewy guys were hopping on, replacing 3 other people. 
	- Ryan essentially brought Chewy Management to Gamestop. They know have 1/3 of the company's vote.  
	- GME Management knew that a takeover was happening, hostile or not and so they opened the doors. They also expanded Ryan Cohen's ability to buy up to 20% of the total shares  
	- Permit And Hestia Capital also align more with his vision so that would put them at a 5/9 majority  
Result: Even with the news, the stock price stayed range bound at 20.5 and volume was extremely low for that Monday and Tuesday.  Shorts were once again depressing the price. However, Wednesday came and the first of the shorts closed their position while bulls bought calls. The stock soared. This catalyzed into a gamma squeeze to kick off the huge rally.  

--  
The analysis stopped dead of the gamma squeeze as these recent events have been a gray area of interpretation. Enjoy.

&#x200B;

For a while I have tracked the companies reporting earnings every week with a high short interest and high number of Days to Cover (given average volume). I figured this would be helpful for the rest of us to see what companies have a high short squeeze potential, as well as a catalyst in the short term. I'll begin posting this earlier on Sundays, sorry this first one is so late. Happy Hunting!

A generation of people affected by 2008; many of whom had just taken their first steps into adulthood, or were just kids when they overheard the desperation in their parents‚Äô voices as they discussed their bills, only to be drowned out by intimidating talk of recessions and bailouts from the news. The very institutions Americans had placed their faith in were backed into a corner by their own greed, and this generation took the fall. Many stood up to the injustice and were met with splashes of champagne, a humiliating mockery from the very same who had designed their fate. This generation was shaped in one way or another by the 2008 Financial Crisis, and now, this very same generation has seen that it was all for naught; that those who were responsible for 2008 have not learned; that greed has yet again led to a black swan event once only discussed in our own small corner of the internet; that the institutions will still do everything they can to avoid responsibility. But unlike 2008, the power is in the hands of the people, the hands of those who endured those hard years, the hands of this generation. And as I sit here, gazing out my window at a city of stars, I feel at peace. I know that this generation is the one that endured enough to say no more, and the one that not only has the strength and resolve to fight, but the one that has the will to sacrifice for the greater good. To this generation, to all of you, it has been an honor to be apart of this movement, and I can‚Äôt wait for tomorrow.|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092919.csv|StockTicker|['A']|[]|['I', 'A', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']|[]

Buying Puts on GME made me only five bucks after I bought a put and sold so as a gay bear from the sub I can't help but speak up. 

Bunch of degens attracting unwanted attention is making this sub a weird GME fan club so I encourage all you theta gang and bear gang to speak up. 

I had a conversation with the wife's boyfriend today and she he is leaving us for another wsb kids n wife cuz they up like 2000% from em diamond hands. Truly amazing however, I believe at the end of the day y'all GME boys gotta gtfo your positions one way or another. Haven't seen good los porn for too long. It is boring seeing the same theme over the past week or two. 

The worst part of all this GME shit is that we are now being labeled as retail investors. It is way above my iq to read on wtf is going on following the amazing nut squeeze on Melvin and his boy friends while trying to search by new. My tiny brain hurts. So I just have one question, when you duckers gonna sale so I my puts can print too? Tired this sub all the sudden being flooded with so many ppl knows more than shit post and FDs. Y'all too successful at Yoloing gotta bring your diamond hands to r investing if you holding shares and your option is deep itm with expiration passing next Friday.

TLTR just tell me when y'all gonna sell your GME positions, it is okay to lie. But hearing it will make a gay bear happy

I just wanted to say how blown away I am by what's happening. Last year, I was heavily invested (most of my portfolio, not smart I know) in GNUS which ended up getting fucked by and over-shorted by Citron resulting in heavy losses. I was doing very well trading until that point which probably gave me the confidence to commit that much capital. I was forced to pull back from trading because I couldn't sustain the loss. I'm 22 with a tax bill and a business that's on hold due to covid so I can only take so many losses. Another year, another opportunity for a bounce-back hopefully.  I genuinely believed in the company and went long but then Citron came along and created a shitstorm of bad PR and almost got the company delisted essentially with how far they forced the price down. I remember seeing teachers, firemen, and just regular people who put their life savings get burned badly by these institutions for absolutely no reason.

They tried to do the same with GameStop but you guys didn't let it happen. This genuinely makes me so fucking proud and brings tears to my eyes.

I'm playing a part in this movement by trying to educate as many people around as possible on the situation, explaining what's going on, where to buy GME and why these institutions deserve the punishment they're getting. It's working!!! Excited to be back in the game once I hopefully get the business up and running after covid.

Keep strong ladies and gents <3"|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092916.csv|StockTicker|['A']|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GNUS', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'PR', 'I', 'GME', 'I']|['GME']

no, you're not going to hurt the suits or destroy the financial system by buying and holding gme. you're just going to lose fucktons of money, get this sub banned and probably get a whole bunch more restrictions put on 'retail investors', 'for their own good'.

there's no shorts left to squeeze and the castle in the air only stands so long as there's another buyer willing to take it at a higher price. this is tulip bulbs at this stage and nothing more.

I think it's pretty weak if that was your decision to do so.

There's a lot of people flooding to your business and your mobile app now because of this subreddit. Even though the UI for your mobile app is pretty bad compared to ROBEMGOOD.

As a suggestion could you possibly open fractional investing up for people with the minimum deposit required to open an account with you? $100. Or maybe allocate a little of your large amount of shares for these retail investors?

There's a lot of people who would like to buy fractional shares in these companies you turned off and they have the right to do so. You were offering this option before. When everything went down and people couldn't buy shares you turned that option off.

If there's a reason these retail investors can't buy fractional shares, can you at least release an announcement as to why that is? And don't bullshit us?

If you have already turned the option back on, please disregard. With your Quick Ticket system that you have to use in order to buy fractional shares, you can't place an order until market opens.  So I haven't been able to check since Friday and it was still off. 

Here's an article from Reuters you posted that says ROBEMGOOD still isn't offering fractional shares.

Neither was Fidelity last I checked even though I tested it prior to the whole fiasco and it worked.

Disclaimer: Not an advisor just think it's kind of shitty to turn off an option for investors with smaller amounts of capitol, unless you were forced by regulators to do so.  Then it's the regulators who are shitty. Unless there is no more actual shares to buy and that doesn't seem to be the case. What's going on with that?"|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092930.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'UI', 'MGOOD', 'I', 'MGOOD', 'I', 'I']|[]

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As we've been seeing this weekend, multiple bots have been hard pushing silver. At almost exactly the same time as this happened (EOD Friday) it was announced that SLV and futures were rising rapidly due to the 'Reddit mob' even though the vast majority of retail has no way to trade on weekends or touch futures.

This is obviously because no one has jumped on silver. Or at least not retail. The banks sure do love silver, and so do the boys at Shitadel. Shitadel is the fifth largest holder, along with several large banks.

**Their strategy is probably something like this:**

They are running out of ammunition and their investors are scared. They love to hedge with commodities, and because they and their investors are scared now is the time to stock up. They've bought out most major suppliers and at the same time pushed the narrative that it was done by Reddit. Why?

Because they don't want people to know they're scared. They don't want people to know they are losing and buying commodities. This is their hedge, this is their attempt to cover their losses. They want to stock up on silver, but when they do that in large numbers the tickers and futures will spike. How do they explain that without giving away their position? ""Reddit did it.""

After they cause silver to spike in a meaningful way, they need someone to sell it off to. They've artificially created demand for silver and prevented suppliers from being able to sell to retail, and now it's trending on social media and boomer media. So what's the next step? How will they sell? Later on, they will push the silver narrative once more even harder, blaming Reddit for trying to collapse the dollar (because let's be real we fucking love clout) and all of the suppliers will suddenly have large amounts of silver available again for Reddit to get their hands on.

They want to egg you on, show you the proof by raising silver prices, and then sell it to you and line their pockets with your cash. Artificially raising the price and then selling it off the moment they can. There's a phrase for this but I think it keeps getting my posts removed.

Anyone you see pushing SLV, AG, and physical silver is either heavily misinformed, a(u)(r)tistic beyond all belief, or paid off by a bank.

Yes, silver is heavily shorted. No, Reddit will not win a commodity war. Banks control actual physical supply lines, not just paper shares. There is no beating them at this game. People have tried and all but disappeared for it, multiple times.

If you want to ride their rise of silver then by all means go for it, but be aware that it is not retail investors causing this to rise. It is likely the people that need more ammo for this next week: Banks and HFs.

TL;DR

Banks are blaming a spike in silver futures on Reddit to hide their own hedging, and are shilling silver here so that when it becomes available for purchase retail will pay a premium to 'get in' on a short that doesn't exist. Retail lines their pockets with money, and they get to empty their mansions of all the silver they hoarded."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092916.csv|StockTicker|['A']|[]|['I', 'I', 'GME', 'EOD', 'SLV', 'I', 'SLV', 'AG', 'M', 'DR']|['GME']

time) to when the news broke and Cramer shat his pants on CNBC last Monday.

**

Why do you think this?**

First, MELVIN was NOT the ONLY ones SHORT, they were just
the slowest ones to cover (and hence probably will continue to be the poster-child for
bukkake gang-rape by millennials and zoomers with stimmy checks).

Second, GME literally went from $5 per share to $37 per
share by January 15, 2021, the settlement date for the latest short float
update (I‚Äôll come back to your fucking daily updates from S3 Partners and Ortex
later on, and why I don‚Äôt trust them).

To put it into perspective for these unscrupulous, criminal,
BIG money positions on the short-side that have been here a LOOOONG time,
that‚Äôs already a 750% loss.

If someone had put in **JUST** $1M in August 2020 (by the
way, the short float % was around 99% at this time, so I KNOW more got in short
after this) hoping for a Gamestop bankruptcy, by Jan 15, 2021 these fuckers
would have lost $8M in total (initiating position would have been about 200K
shares short, by the time it gets to 1/15/2021, $37 x 200K shares =¬† $7.4M.

So, by wagering $1M on the short side, you now have to buy
back and return your shares. You now have a $6.4M loss.

**WELL THAT FUCKING SUCKS? Right? Well then what does a 400-IQ,
uncircumcized-dick hedgie with a wedgie want to do about this situation? They
GOTTA make that loss back SOMEWAY SOMEHOW.**

You could suck trucker dick or deal drugs, but these
white-collar yuppies have enough power to NOT have to stoop down to that level.

**

Here is how they CAN, and probably ARE, doing it right
now:**

Melvin wasn‚Äôt the only short position. Just the most
retarded one that didn‚Äôt cover in time, so they had to go through a whole
fucking liquidity crisis, class action lawsuit, and dick-eating meme-fest while
literally asking for sugar-daddy money. What about the less retarded short
positions? Well, they probably have some losses too, because I mean, they did
get squeezed in the earlier portion of the play, but now they have sights on
something else.

**First, your hedgies (excluding Melvin & Citron)
continue to push the narrative: ‚ÄúThrow Melvin & Citron to the masses and
keep the retail investors coming in with their diamond hands and high school
diplomas.‚Äù**

Second, **hedgies go LONG on GME shares now**. WTF HOW?
Well remember that for short positions, there are LENDERS of these shares.
These lenders would happily let go of their positions at the ‚Äútop‚Äù of a
squeeze. (It‚Äôs ez fucking profit, and they want none of this mess).

Third, you now have a long position with underlying shares.
What‚Äôs the best play here? You fucking write call options because the vol
premiums are literally mooning at the moment. And I‚Äôve been on WSB long enough
to know that WSB‚Äôs risk management is literally just selling one-paired organ
to afford the option premium on FDs.

Lastly, you push the narrative of a ‚ÄúGAMMA SQUEEZE‚Äù which is
JUST a little bit too hard for your average joe from Mississippi to understand
with his Algebra 2 from high school ‚Äì Essentially telling him, ‚ÄúHEY THERES
STILL MORE TO SQUEEEEEZE.‚Äù

¬†

**

REAL Gs MOVE IN SILENCE:**

Look at the volumes, the float rotation in the past week for
GME is already enough to have fucked virgins 20 times and sacrificed them to
capitalist gods. 

Which means for hedgies with wedgies, it‚Äôs no longer a
tail-risk, blind-side event, it‚Äôs time to REAP the souls of every stimmy check
fool, by ‚ÄúMaRkET MAkInG‚Äù.

If I am that Hedgie, I write call options, while maintaining
a fa√ßade that I will ‚Äúrationally‚Äù hedge those positions by buying more of the
underlying shares. FUN FACT: I already have them.

You stimmy check tards will keep buying into GME, because
you heard about it in the news over the weekend and want to get in on this
action to ‚ÄúSTICK IT TO THE MAN‚Äù because 2020 has been an absolute suicidal
descent into madness because of COVID. You will probably go on for a couple
more days this upcoming week, now that liquidity restrictions are slowly being
lifted on trading platforms.

SO, while you fools supply buying volume, all I have to do
is collect my premiums on option sales, while slowly unwinding my underlying
share positions, and thereby also managing risk of option assignment since I‚Äôll
sell shares into every spike and swerve the price away from the strike price of
YOUR options.

And I‚Äôll also have an expectation as to where GME could
potentially rise to. You just look at the WSB subscriber count, multiply that
by the avg retail trader account liquidity.

You guys will think you have stuck it to the man, but the
man is sticking your wife ALREADY, ever since the moment you got angry and
emotional about an opportunity to unleash your pent up hatred towards the Wall
Street system. All I am saying is, for every tard like Melvin, there‚Äôs 20 other
hedgies out there to fuck you up without you even realizing it. After all it‚Äôs
done, they‚Äôll even make you feel bad, saying you were ‚ÄúGreedy‚Äù and ‚ÄúReckless‚Äù,
further perpetuating emotional volatility in markets that they will keep
profiting off of.

So while the retail GME HODLER thinks there‚Äôs still enough
gold raining from the top of midtown Manhattan, all they‚Äôre getting is piss and
pre-cum.

¬†

**

APPENDIX ‚Äì Ortex & S3 Partners**

If you got all the way through until now, I apologize for my
lack of presentation in this thesis, it‚Äôs literally 3AM in the East Coast US
because I‚Äôm up for 4AM pre-market (don‚Äôt fucking judge me, I‚Äôm a retard too).

So I‚Äôll explain that point from WAY up there about short
interest estimates.

I don‚Äôt give a flying fuck what Ortex and S3 Partners says.
I do NOT believe that short float is STILL above %100 after the official data
came out on 1/27 with a lag of two fucking weeks from its settlement date on
1/15. The stock price moved so egregiously that every autist in Manhattan would
have literally gone bankrupt if they‚Äôre still short, NOT just Melvin.

See, here‚Äôs the thing. If the system is ALREADY built with
this **two weeks lag** on short data for individual stocks, what fucking
data analytics company in their right mind would NOT try to take advantage of
this time & information arbitrage? The system is FUCKED, but it gets
perpetuated because the ones perpetuating this have the MOST to gain.

Ortex and S3 Partners is purely a marketing ploy, they
hopped on this gravy train to get your subcriptions and some more clicky-clicks
on their website traffic so they can use those metrics to raise some more funds
later on.

And even if they believed in your cause, no smart data
analytics firm would willingly give up that information arbitrage to the
public, if they want to ever think about doing business with ANY hedge-fund in
town.

Therefore, I am sticking to my autistic thought that the
system is stacked (which most of you agree) against us. BUT, I urge you to be a
little bit more careful, because short float data can be misleading at best and
a total fraudulent bull-trap at worst. 

Again, If you are new here, welcome to the gang. This sub
will always be about losing money and becoming best friends with your wife‚Äôs
boyfriend. But over time, it will be about the friends and knowledge you gained
along the way.

They had to realise gains from other investments just to cover losses from GME. Thursday and Friday were the days with the biggest deleveraging sisnce March 2020. Each day they have to pay high interest just to mantain the short positions, and you know what? Every time they realise gains to cover losses their performance gets worse, and this makes them look like idiots in front of their clients, putting their business in danger.

# Expect some crazy volatility

Remember you are playing against hedge funds, they are not going to give you free money. There is no free money in the stock market. GME investors hit them hardly, and for them is not just about losses but they have to proof to their clients that they cannot be beaten by a bunch of redditors. They may suppress the price or manipulate it. There are some excellent posts on this sub about how they manipulate the stock price (ladder attacks, MSM misinformation, etc).

# Manage your risk

I hold GME since $20s. For me right now there is no risk in holding the stock because it will never go back to that level. If you just bought at $300 have in mind they may be able to supress the price for days or weeks to $100-$200 level, so you must be able to stomach this volatility. I would recommend only investing money you can afford to lose to not panic sell if you see this wild volatily.

The important thing as an investor is to hold, more than to buy like crazy.

# Be a critical thinker, do your DD

There is nothing that the MSM wishes more than to see loss porn from retail investors to say ""see, they didn't know what they were doing"". Please, don't give them the opportunity to say that.

Do your DD, check user history whenever you read something to make sure users are no hedge fund trolls. Hedge funds are now trying to focus you attention on everything except GME. The Silver play is a trap. Citadel is long silver. 

# BEWARE THAT IF YOU BUY SILVER, you are helping Citadel to cover losses with their gains and give them the chance to fight on GME.

Maybe mods should ban silver posts as lots of people could potentially lose money on that play.

&#x200B;

TLDR:

DO YOUR OWN DD. BE CRITICAL.

HOLD. THEY HAVE THE WEAK HAND, NOT YOU.

BEWARE OF SILVER.

For SEC minions reading this: this is not investment advice.

Edit 1: many thanks for the awards guys.

Edit 2: WSJ and Bloomberg are pushing the silver narrative and creating the impression that somehow people here are coordinated which is complete false. Also Citadel is long silver and it seems posts are being created mainly by bots. I definitely think mods should take action.

Edit 3: about silver, it is not my call, I am just sharing my point of view, I totally get the people who says nothing should be banned. Just have in mind MSM are depicting WSB as a group of organized investors that are colluding to target different assets, which is completely false. Should their message gets acceptance because of SLV they could try to ban this sub. So I think mods should at least check if those posts are legit, and if they comply with the rules.

Short explanation: [Anatomy Of A Short Attack
](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D#aoh=16119453107704&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Finstablog%2F11442671-gerald-klein%2F3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack)

>Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

-
>The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

-
>When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.

-
Long explanation: [Counterfeiting Stock 2.0
](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)

>Illegal naked shorting and stock manipulation are two of Wall Street's deep, dark secrets. These practices have been around for decades and have resulted in trillions of dollars being fleeced from the American public by Wall Street. In the process, many emerging companies have been put out of business. This report will explain the magnitude of this problem, how it happens, why it has been covered up and how short sellers attack a company. It will also show how all of the participants; the short hedge funds, the prime brokers and the Depository Trust Clearing Corp. (DTCC)‚Äîmake unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small American investor continues unabated.

-
>Why is This Important? This problem affects the investing public. Whether invested directly in the stock market or in mutual funds, IRAs, retirement or pension plans that hold stock ‚Äî it touches the majority of Americans.

(...)

-
>The participants in this fraud, which, when fully exposed, will make Enron look like child's play, have been very successful in maintaining a veil of secrecy and impenetrability. Congress and the SEC have unknowingly (?) helped keep the closet door closed. The public rarely knows when its pocket is being picked as unexplained drops in stock price get chalked up to ‚Äúmarket forces‚Äù when they are often market manipulations.

-
>The stocks most frequently targeted are those of emerging companies who went to the stock market to raise start‚Äìup capital. Small business brings the vast majority of innovative new ideas and products to market and creates the majority of new jobs in the United States. It is estimated that over 1000 of these emerging companies have been put into bankruptcy or had their stock driven to pennies by predatory short sellers.

-
>It is important to understand that selling a stock short is not an investment in American enterprise. A short seller makes money when the stock price goes down and that money comes solely from investors who have purchased the company's stock. A successful short manipulation takes money from investment in American enterprise and diverts it to feed Wall Street's insatiable greed‚Äîthe company that was attacked is worse off and the investing public has lost money. Frequently this profit is diverted to off‚Äìshore tax havens and no taxes are paid. This national disgrace is a parasite on the greatest capital market in the world.

-
>**Who are the Participants in the Fraud?**

-
>**The participants subscribe to the theory that it is much easier to make money tearing companies down than making money building them up, and they fall into two general categories: 1) They participate in the process of producing the counterfeit shares that are the currency of the fraud and/or 2) they actively short and tear companies down.**

-
>**The counterfeiting of shares is done by participating prime brokers or the DTC, which is owned by the prime brokers. A number of lawsuits that involve naked shorting have named about ten of the prime brokers as defendants, including Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch; UBS; Morgan Stanley and others. The DTCC has also been named in a number of lawsuits that allege stock counterfeiting.**"|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092919.csv|StockTicker|['A']|[]|['A', 'DTC', 'SEC', 'A', 'A', 'DTC', 'A', 'DTCC']|[]

After what happened with gamestop, I'm convinced that this shit really might work out. On the other hand there are a lot of people thinking that this is just something to draw attention away from GME and withdraw fund from the stock. Let me assure you this is not my attention. And if you're all about GME I suggest reading here because it's a waste of time.

I personally think that slv really might be the next big thing that could work out. Therefore I'd suggest to not go against the idea generally. Keep your hands at gamestop as long as you want, but once work is done, get together into this next big thing.

\*\*Here's what happens or might happen:\*\*About the theory of the silversqueeze. Can't really be compared to the GME squeeze as it is not about squeezing out hedgefunds shortsellers in particular. The idea is that the silver price is priced way too low for the amount of silver that physically exists. The silvermarket volume on paper (exchanges/Futures..) is 250 times bigger than the supply of physical silver (just read this and didn't do my own DD if numbers are correct). The Idea is that a physical shortage will be caused and this would really let slv skyrocket with all that derivatives that are not backed. Now imagine some 7 million apes and the following retail investors that come after suddenly plunger the physical silver market...

Example: Let's assume there is a shortage and Person A wants physical delivery of the future he bought. Person B as the seller needs to deliver 5000 ounces of silver. If supply is short, the person buys another future from Person C in order to be able to deliver the slv needed. You understand the reaction this causes.

Also the silver market is said to be manipulated and kept low for a long time. I have no opinion on this.

\*\*What happened on the weekend?\*\*Silver already surged 20% since friday morning which was most likely a result of the news of ""Wallstreetbets taking over silver"" and ""Shortage in silver supply"".example: [https://twitter.com/bitpanda/status/1356023060814585859](https://twitter.com/bitpanda/status/1356023060814585859)Also I noticed several locals stores and online stores being sold out completely on silver and it looks like this is not only regarding a few small dealers.[https://www.theepochtimes.com/reddit-forum-sparks-physical-silver-shortage-on-major-dealers-websites\_3679079.html](https://www.theepochtimes.com/reddit-forum-sparks-physical-silver-shortage-on-major-dealers-websites_3679079.html)Also social media generates a lot of heat.

So it look's like it's happening - if we're heading to a global shortage, prices could absolutely go to the moon and this is a big time chance to be with it at the beginning right now. Additionally there is a good chance that shortsellers have learnt from what was happening with GME and they might get out of their short positions earlier which will generate further momentum.

**What you can do** in order to participate and make this work:It does not help the cause if you buy mining companys (even though it might generate good income). But still, in order moon the prices, you'll need to invest physically. The options are:\* Buying silver futures and let it physically deliver. Only possible if you can easily invest some 150k.\* Buying slv or pslv if you live at the hamburgers, and for instance ""Xtrackers physical silber"" if you're from Europe. It's really important that you check if the fund needs to fully physically cover it's assets (=buy silver). Because not all do so.\* The next option is to physically buy silver at your local store or webshop.\* At last, you can buy options. Your counterpart might want to hedge the positions and therefore will potentially be covered. This is also obviously the part where you can win big time (or lose everything). My weapon of choice is:  34.00C expiring in April

I prefer a mix of above.

But as we all know, I'm just another ape sharing brainfarts, hence I'm definitely not in the position to give financial advice. Also I'm long on slv, silver options and bought the silver of some local shops.

TL;DR:This post is **NOT about GME**. No selly selly - I get the hype! But silver might be one of the best chances for the upcoming weeks I believe. And today it's still a chance to get in early at low prices.

e/okay, guess we have to wait until GME is through. Looks like most in here aren't open for a new relationsship. Anything that's not GME/AMC gets downvoted to hell. ITT: People with weak hands scared of any funds going from gme to slv - this is ridiculous.

This is all because of the market makers so do not worry, as this is typical and was seen all last week. Even if more restrictions will hit just hold and we will bounce right back up if the consistency of the holders stay unchanged.

&#x200B;

AMC going from +20% to remaining unchanged at 0% whilst GME goes to almost +10% and then remaining unchanged premarket at the exact same time will be the norm the coming time.

&#x200B;

Best advice is: hold and buy more as this is just the same garbage as went on as a result of the big hedge funds getting hit in the end of last week. RobinHood are still the puppy of Citadel and will keep on making this as scary for new investors etc.

&#x200B;

And of course, I am only telling you this because I like this stonk :).

Our analysis suggests a decrease in overall shares shorted, dipping below the 30 million share level. (Watch this space for more analysis tomorrow.) Moreover, S3 data reveals that trading in the latter part of the last week gave short sellers exit points below GME‚Äôs high water mark levels and reduced their mark-to-market losses.

There doesn't seem to be a good summary for the non-wsb (il)literate to understand why he doesn't represent the community.

I think this is one core reason why it's so easy for him to get the media attention that he has.

This guy is named in all of the ""here's what is happening"" articles and videos and I can't find a single simple breakdown of why the douchebag should not be associated with r/wsb and what is happening with GME et. al. in order to refute the reference.

Sure the subreddit knows, but plebs cannot be directed to a random collection of archived threads with rainbows and rockets and only u/<name> to identify the parties.

* [**Download Fidelity Active Trader Pro**](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/advanced-trading-tools/active-trader-pro/overview) \- This gives you a baller desktop interface with red lines and green lines and lists of numbers and you can see option chains and latest trade prices and quantities (T2 data). No üöÄ emojis though.

* [**Activate Real Time Quotes**](https://www.fidelity.com/customer-service/how-to-get-real-time-quotes) \- you need to acknowledge some stuff that was too long and I didn't read. If you don't do this, you're 15 minutes behind.
* [**Activate Extended Hours Trading**](http://personal.fidelity.com/webxpress/help/topics/learn_extended_hours_trading.shtml) \- Fidelity requires you speak with customer service and they talk about the risks of extended hours trading.
* **Trading on margin** \- you can call them to set up a margin trading agreement, but I don't recommend that because I'm an index fund boomer at heart.
* **Sell Limit Rules** \- Not that any of us would ever sell a stock we like so much, but Fidelity allows Sell Limits to be placed only 50% over the latest price. So we're gonna have to get well beyond $40k for us to be able to enter our $69,420.69 sell limits.

Positions:

* GME x 7 @ 336
* AMC x 7 @ 13
* Incredibly chiseled Diamond Hands from holding my index funds through 2008 and beyond

I spent the weekend looking for good opportunities to flip wall street. I set out looking for stocks that have good technicals to pull off a GME style short squeeze. I think DMC Global Inc, trading as BOOM (yep, that really is the ticker), is our best play. Here is why.

To find a play, I am looking for companies that are way over shorted, that aren‚Äôt too big and that could be squeezed by a WSB onslaught. I looked for these things:

1. Stock where there is **more than 100% institutional hold**, which indicates naked short selling
2. Stock where there is **more than 15% of float that is openly shorted**, these are shares that have been borrowed and shorted.
3. Stock with a **reasonable market cap** so we can move it, smaller is better here.
4. Any other factors revealed by a review of the company.

I am not an investment advisor and I am not giving any investment advice. #DYOR I have an MBA and know how markets work. I‚Äôm a geek who got into coding and finance in high school and working and investing for more than 20 years. I bought my first Jag with investment gains and people asked if I was old enough to drive it! I also got screwed over multiple times by banks and institutional investors. In 2008, I lost 3 years of my hard work investing when a broker closed out some of my positions at the worst possible crashing moment (to protect me!) and left me holding a bag of shit. I watched my broker front run my trades. When started with OTC, I saw them settle their prop desk‚Äôs least favorable trades of the day to me. Robinhood didn‚Äôt invent this stuff. If you‚Äôre in this to change Wall Street, let‚Äôs break their trades and take back the markets.

First, I think targeting companies like Nokia is a bad idea. **NOK has a market cap of 25.6 billion and not enough shorts on it. It will be very hard to move such a monster. BB is another case with few shorts and almost 9bil mkt cap.** AMC with a cap of 4.5 billion is already a challenge. GME was around 2 billion when we started this and it‚Äôs 22 billion now - very hard to hold at this level. We have to ask: **‚ÄúHow big is this challenge - a mountain or a boulder?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs on the other side of  the trade and how deep?‚Äù** Keep these questions in mind before we move.

Secondly, **this is not long term investing** \- we are playing a hard game vs. wall street. It‚Äôs about momentum and trade positions. Company data doesn‚Äôt matter: EPS, EBITDA, cash flow - it doesn‚Äôt matter for a short squeeze trade. With GME, we have given the company a great opportunity to raise funds and pivot, but its future depends on management. We bankrupted Melvin. That is our achievement. Our goal is hitting the crooks on the other side of these trades: Citadel, SAC, Robinhood, etc. The company is just the football in this game.

Two interesting companies are Teradata Corp and Allogene Therapeutics Inc. These are short squeeze opportunities as well. TDC, has a 105.98% institutional and a 19.46% short interest with a cap of 2.9billion. TDC is almost 4x bigger than BOOM, so it will be harder to move with lower beta and a lower institutional so moves will have less impact. ALLO, has a 61.46% institutional and a 19.52% short interest with a cap of 4.9billion. Price action is not aggressive either but Allogen 8x bigger than BOOM and could be much harder to move.

After looking at these and several other candidates, I found the best option, one that I believe could be successful in less than 3 days. It is DMC Global Inc. (NASDAQ:BOOM)

1. **DMC has 114.49% institutional hold** \- this means that there are hedge funds that have big short positions on this stock, many of which are naked. Naked shorts create the phantom shares representing 15% more than the float. Naked short is when you short the stock and the lender who let you short sell the stock actually didn‚Äôt deliver the stock to you. This creates phantom shares. *Let me say that again:* there are 115% of the issued shares in play, that extra 15% in play *does not exist, but is owed*. These shares have been short sold without actually having shares to sell.
2. **DMC has 17.46% Short Interest**, so pretty heavily shorted. This means that pushing the stock up will squeeze that like a big zit on a small face.  This is way bigger % than NOK and BB who have a little zit on a big face.
3. **The market cap is just around 1 billion**. It won‚Äôt take huge volume to squeeze this one.
4. Other interesting features are a) **beta of 1.3**. The stock historically moves more than the market and b) recent price moves are up, but the **stock hasn‚Äôt had any crazy big run**, so there is a lot of room to push this up really fast. c) fyi: DMC has a real business manufacturing metal parts and accessories using explosives for the energy industry, 
5. **It trades under ticker BOOM. This is a poetic bonus for this story.**

After looking at these and lots of others. I concluded that the best play is BOOM, it‚Äôs just like a ripe cherry waiting to be picked. I can find no better chance of success than this: a perfectly sized company that is as leveraged and as owned by hedgies as this. **I put this out for everyone and let the WSB mods decide.** The situation won‚Äôt stay like this for long in these volatile markets, so if we decide to act, it must be now. Let‚Äôs make this week another one for the history books. This is our moment. Let‚Äôs change the world, one BOOM at a time!"|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_093000.csv|StockTicker|['BOOM', 'DMC']|[]|['I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'DMC', 'BOOM', 'I', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'DYOR', 'I', 'MBA', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'OTC', 'I', 'I', 'NOK', 'BB', 'AMC', 'GME', 'EPS', 'BITDA', 'GME', 'SAC', 'TDC', 'TDC', 'BOOM', 'ALLO', 'BOOM', 'I', 'I', 'DMC', 'DMC', 'DMC', 'NOK', 'BB', 'DMC', 'BOOM', 'I', 'BOOM', 'I', 'I', 'WSB', 'BOOM']|['GME', 'NOK', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'TDC', 'TDC', 'NOK']

One of them is the detective. It is up to us to figure out the crime and the weak point of the criminals behind the counterfeit stocks. 

Here is a brief history of the crime. 

1. Some hedge funds naked short GME and disguise as normal shorts in the system. This pushes short interest to 140%. This everybody agrees on. 

2. DFV see this and starts a manic squeeze.

3. Massive shares bought by wsb and no doubt other funds.

4. As prices rose these buy trades start to fail, ie the seller fails to deliver the shares to the buyer after 2 days in settlement. You can see the volume on SEC fails website. Some guy tallied up to 1.5m shares failed when price was 10 in december. You can use your imagination what is the fail count at price 350. Note above 10,000 fails gets the stock on SEC watch list. 

5. Because these shares failed to deliver, RH and all brokers faced a sudden margin call from clearing. Why? Simple, RH clients bought shares that are simply not turning up. So RH is essentially short GME stock to its customers. Hence has to post 100% margin instead of 2% and likely the normal interbank loan channels are closed for this high risk purpose. 

6. What can brokers do? They can enforce a buy-in. That means they can force the seller to buy the missing stocks in market using funds in the shorts' account. The US buy-in rules are pretty complex but i understand that it is up to the buyer to enforce a buy-in. Ie RH has to initiate the buy-in.

7. What happens at buy-in? They bid for the volume at any price. The naked shorter goes bankrupt expending all their fund networth to buy stonks that dont exist from people who dont like them. 

So key question is this. When will RH and all brokers enforce the buy-in and why are they not doing it right now?"|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092919.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'DFV', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'RH', 'RH', 'RH', 'GME', 'US', 'RH', 'RH']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME']

They will read you the riot act saying that it can be volatile and then ask if you are cool with that. 

Once you accept the terms with them on the phone it‚Äôs enabled.

In the app when you click trade scroll down to where it says ‚ÄúMore Trade Selections‚Äù then when you click that you will see a movable switch up top that says ‚ÄúEnable Extended hours trading off/on.‚Äù

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092913.csv|StockTicker|['NONE', 'NEVER']|[]|['A', 'H', 'L', 'U', 'S', 'A', 'IRS', 'J', 'R', 'TV']|[]

If things have gone wrong, you guys haven't learned anything at all from it. But if you have hit a jackpot, you have been generous with donations to charities.

But the one thing we haven't really shared as much has been the deep wisdom of the ordinary people from all walks of life. I mean, we would teach our own kids everything we know, so why not do the same for those struggling hedge fund managers, right? I mean, they are only trying to make living and are clearly in a need for some fatherly guidance (just not in the Vatican way of giving it), so I just though it would be time to make a concerted effort to give something back.

I was very inspired by the comments section at r/news, where people are already giving some very helpful advice.

u/Blank_bill suggested that they should invest their money. This is a solid advice. I've heard that McDonald's has been known to help learning this, so hedge fund managers really should give it a shot getting a job there. Like u/GhostofRimbaud said it, they should try looking in the paper and going into establishments with resume in hand, give the boss a firm handshake and ask for a job. I like this, it gives a good impression.

u/bill_hilly also very helpfully noted, that stock market has an inherent risk, so they should not invest more than they are willing to lose. But they could use that stimulus check to do that, u/dietsaddad was kind enough to point that one is coming in no time at all, just 10 short months.

Many people, including but not limited to u/BrownSugarBabe, rightfully pointed that skipping the avocado toast and Starbucks coffee and maybe driving an Uber would help to make up the difference. As u/artbored noted, they wouldn't be struggling nearly as much if they just skipped those $7 lattes.

That's an amazing insight and managers clearly should learn from this. They just have to, as u/csirke4 and many others pointed out, pull themselves by the bootstraps. Maybe learn to code Python or something.

Or perhaps, like u/WeAllSuk pointed, maybe they have some old video games that they could sell.

But if they can't get a job (although u/coachmdubz said the nearest Amazon warehouse is hiring), they could just, as kindly noted by u/Brewboo, ""maybe take that unpaid internship and through hard work and determination one day they too can have a lucrative career.""

This is amazing, with this advice those poor managers on a good career path in no time at all. Or like u/HeyItsTheShanster said, they could learn a trade and be their own bosses.

Personally, I believe families should help and support each other and it's very normal in most part of the world for the children to help out their struggling parents. I mean, camgirls are always wanted and there is always that occasional r/wallstreetbets millionaire in need of that special massage, that could really help to pay for a tuition if the hedge fund manager's paycheck from the Wendy's is not quite enough.

Now, I know what you guys are thinking: ""hedge fund managers don't read reddit and those texts in billboards and behind flying airplanes are too damn short!"" This is why we could use some outside help to make all the users' helpful advice more visible to them. Just like John Oliver always helped Trump on Fox commercial breaks.

But I'm sure those poor, struggling hedge fund managers could use all the advice $GME holders can give them from their vast life experiences. Now, we wouldn't want them have to sell one of their yachts, would we?

I am eagerly waiting to hear all the nuggets of wisdom you guys have to give for those poor folks at Melvin Capital and their friends.

Edit: grammar

Edit 2: since some people seem confused, let me clarify. Point is that one of the great pleasures of life is to piss people off by making them eat their own words. If you can make it publicly in an incredibly sarcastic and passive-aggressive tone, even better.

In this case, giving the reckless billionaire fucks running the hedge funds the same condescending advice ""lazy"" young people struggling with a low-wage dead-end jobs have been receiving for years.

Edit 3: It's one thing to shit on hedge funds by refusing to sell, but we can do better, we can really rub it in while we still have the media attention. 

If even one person with journalistic or otherwise relevant background or any connection to reporters, actors, screenwriters or other people sees this and sees some potential comedic value in it and any of the lines end up being used somewhere, we might have been able ruin some bigwig's day. And it won't cost us a penny."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092919.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', '$GME', 'I']|['GME']

**PUBLISHED**JAN 29, 2021 8:00AM EST

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 29, 2021 /PRNewswire/ --¬†A new class action lawsuit filed in the Central District of California alleges that behemoth online brokerage, Robinhood, breached its duties to investors when it ""willfully and knowingly"" disabled certain crucial and basic trading functions crippling its clients' abilities to trade from their accounts.

Main Street Investors

¬†The complaint alleges that Robinhood clients who owned, or sought to acquire, shares of Gamestop Corp (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) and Blackberry, LTD (NYSE: BB), were damaged when Robinhood deliberately handcuffed their ability to trade, thereby benefitting Wall Street institutions.

According to the lawsuit, ""Robinhood, famous as the champion of the small retail investor(‚Ä¶) Switched sides."" The complaint further states that ""Robinhood acted contrary to the interests of its clients and anointed itself as the overlord of the free market, opting to damage its clients in favor of its own financial interests and the interests of other market participants, many of whom had interests directly adverse to Robinhood's clients."" The suit asserts causes of action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Negligence and Unfair Business Practices, among others.

The case is Gossett, et al. v. Robinhood Financial, LLC, et al Case No. 21-cv-00837. The Plaintiffs are represented by Maurice Pessah of Pessah Law Group, PC (PLG) and Stuart Chelin of Chelin Law Firm, two Los Angeles based law firms.

With the incoming acquisition of Aphria, Tilray will become the largest cannabis company in the world.

Tilray was also selected by the French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified medical cannabis products in France last week.

With a short volume ratio of 31%, Tilray is a heavily shorted stock with potential to be squeezed hard

As a programmer, I always want to define the best and worse outcome of an operation. As a pessimist, I prefer the analysis of the worst-case scenario.  

For GME (20 shares on Robinhood), this is my 2c

(premise) I'm an early adopter of Robinhood, I came from the Scottrade platform. There, in the year 2009, I immediately blew 1000$ in absurd pink sheet trades and then hit my first 8000% return (on 20 bucks). So please don't give me shit for using Robinhood, let's focus on the immediate risk for who's holding using Robinhood (& co)

It's obvious that their software engineers and data scientists are working around the clock at Robinhood to release a growing number of kill switches on the platform, and they walking on eggshells. 

They are most likely slicing and dicing data to find the shortest path to bail out their investors/owners.

Whatever they can not legally do, they might achieve with a self-inflicted DDOS. 

There is so much money at stake! 

You know they are combing through our data, they are building profiles and ranking users and their positions: 

    3.17 am
    Your limit order was cancelled because the limit price you set was too far away from the market price.
    You can place a new limit order if you wish.

**I truly don't like this.**  

* There could be platform outages during the squeeze;
* There could be a ""bug"" that accidentally replaces ""too high"" limits with ""market price"";
* Securities might be forcibly liquidated, while accounts are locked for technical reasons;

I am afraid Robinhood (and others) will be **thrown under the bus**, implode, take all the blame, the shame, losses and happily chapter 7 out of the way."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092919.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'DDOS', 'I', 'I']|['GME']

I decided to turn to the Torah for help.*   
*""At the end of every seven years, you shall celebrate the remission year. The idea of the remission year is that every creditor shall remit any debt owed by his neighbor and brother when God's remission year comes around. You may collect from the alien, but if you have any claim against your brother for a debt, you must relinquish it...."" (Deuteronomy 15:1‚Äì6)*

*The correlation between Jewish Sabbatical years and major declines/crashes in stock prices is heavily studied. In the Judaism tradition, the number 7 holds great significance. Shabbat is observed on the 7th day of a 7-day cycle, the shmita or sabbatical year is observed on the 7th year of a 7 year cycle, and the Jubilee year is celebrated at the end of seven cycles of shmita.*  

*I found a way to apply this concept of ""every 7th year"" to the algorithm and further improve its risk/reward profile. What I did was simply reverse the parameters of the algorithm during every 7th year of a 7 year cycle. Whereas normally, the sun traveling through a Dow drop prediction sector would mean the prediction of a market decline--now, in making use of the ""every 7th year"" concept by reversing the algorithm only during the 7th year, the sun traveling through a Dow drop prediction sector(during that 7th year) starts to mean the prediction of a market rise and vice versa... the sun traveling through a Dow rise prediction sector(during that 7th year) starts to mean the prediction of a market drop.*

Hey fellow retards, I just wanted flag this great post by [u/MarioBuzo](https://www.reddit.com/u/MarioBuzo/) and offer a high-level version for those in the trenches. Basically, you're not only fighting the shorts, but the media (surprise!), the DTCC and its clearing agents while the regulatory bodies remain indifferent (complicit?). As always, assume what you will. Synopsis post below.

1. First, the shorts work with the banks to create fraudulent shares to drive the price down. This was most likely the cause of Thursday‚Äôs dip in GME‚Äôs shares. The HFs and the bank literally trade the same shares back and forth with each other to drive the price down in larger volumes than the buy orders and then never deliver the shares because they never own them in the first place. This technique is known as ‚Äústrategic fails-to-deliver‚Äù and is basically given a pass by the SEC.
2. Next, the shorts work with the usual media suspects and research analysts to push their lies.
3. Third, the DTCC, which is the central repository for all shares and owned by the brokerages, allows the creation of billions of counterfeit shares through a process called Continuous Net Settlement (CNS) that never even make it to the SEC. This is where everything gets very murky. Naturally, the DTCC has resisted every effort at transparency.
4. Fourth, brokerages pull margin from customers causing a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Anyone seen that recently?)

The short's playbook today is the same as its always been. Only it never accounted for a WSB rebellion.

I highly suggest reading the articles because I‚Äôm only skimming the surface of how complicated and rigged the entire system is. Not surprisingly the root cause is the sheer amount of money involved for all the players.

TLDR: HOLD! üöÄ"|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092919.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'DTCC', 'SEC', 'DTCC', 'SEC', 'DTCC', 'WSB', 'I', 'HOLD']|[]

It is a revolution! It is regular people against the establishment. It's the unemployed bankrupting hedgefunds. Throw away your old valuations and look at this new. This is a movement....and there's fucking value in that!

How high can this go? This is where Ryan Cohen shines. We never know how far he will take this, but I know the dude is fucking brilliant. So fucking brilliant that I'm willing to give him my entire 401k to make this happen.

GameStop is no longer a retailer, it is a viral company. We need to value it like a viral company. Look at Dollar Shave Club. (Almost) everyone buys razors and doesn't give a shit where they come from. But DSC changed everything. People WANTED to buy razors from DSC. I believe we will WANT to buy from GameStop. Fuck, I love this company (and stock) so much, if GameStop starts selling razors, I will buy them.

Dollar Shave Club was sold to Unilever for $1billion when sales were around $100million ($200million projected). I believe GameStop has more value. They are going to increase sales 3x or 4x. They will increase their online presence and start selling more products. This is going to be huge. My valuation of GameStop is 15x current sales, or $1,398.85 per share and my target price is $2,797.70 within 2 years. 

The short squeeze will push this stock even higher, but for the long term the current price is a bargain.

I'M HOLDING THIS STOCK!

I know GameStop is a good retail company and I'm confident they will grow after this, but it is also personal. The criminals who paused my trades need to go to jail. When they get out, I want them to see a fucking GameStop store everywhere they go. Every shopping center, every mall, fucking everywhere! I want Gamestop to be bigger than Walmart. To do my part, I will buy everything from Gamestop. If they sell toiletpaper, I'll fucking buy.

$300/share is a bargain.

Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let‚Äôs talk about this & other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.

We saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy & Tech were the biggest losers. 

So, let‚Äôs take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It‚Äôs really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.

We also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits & compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.

Meanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.

This week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google & Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm & Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.

In some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021üöÄüöÄüöÄ, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla‚Äôs EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.

Meanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn‚Äôt have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks & Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favoritesüöÄüöÄüöÄ.

The recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59) üöÄüöÄüöÄ, while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than ¬æ of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.

Interactive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.

So‚Ä¶ I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second‚Ä¶ this one is very hard to predict‚Ä¶ Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocksüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven‚Äôt helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.üöÄüöÄ

And finally, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).

This is not meant as a negative scare tactic but only a potential hypothesis of what may occur.

1. GameStop has the ability to raise a secondary offering by issuing more shares into either the public or private markets. Technically, they can issue 300 million shares. Here is an SEC Filing from 2005 [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312513364182/d569889dex31.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312513364182/d569889dex31.htm)
2. Even if the above SEC filing did not exist they would probably structure something to allow a secondary offering as the market has given them a second lifeline ( Just 1 year ago they were a company worth $200m today they are worth 100x that).
3. It is highly unlikely that GameStop will issue 300 million shares or even 100 million shares
4. I believe it is realistic to think that they may raise $1-2 Billion in a secondary offering probably some portion of debt and equity (not just flooding the market).
5. They could do this by either offering a non-dilutive secondary offering by selling their shares they currently hold, or by causing a dilution event and issuing more shares
6. In a dilution event this would look like adding 10% of shares to the market which will have some impact but doubt it will crater the stock.
7. Google raised about $4 Billion through something similar in 2005 [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondaryoffering.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondaryoffering.asp)
8. In some ways it would be foolish for the company not to take advantage of the current situation and raise some amounts of additional capital.

&#x200B;

TLDR: GameStop will likely do a secondary offering but it will be unlikely flood the market with 300 million shares.

These are just my best guesses not facts."|2021-02-01 09:29:09.026224|../output/raw/2021/02/01/StockTicker_092927.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['GME', 'I', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'I']|['GME']

UPDATE 1-Hedge fund body alarmed by retail investor frenzy 'distortions'

2021/02/01 03:12

By Huw Jones

LONDON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Wall Street's retail trading frenzy has distorted markets, global hedge funds industry body AIMA said on Monday, adding it was concerned that lawmakers were encouraging such moves.

Retail investors gathering in social media chatrooms like Reddit have been driving up the price of stocks like GameStop GME.N shorted by hedge funds, with the focus shifting to other parts of the market on Monday, such as silver.

""What is dangerous, amid this trading frenzy, is that retail investors have been chasing prices so far above any sane valuation and that many will end up nursing losses,"" AIMA CEO Jack Inglis said in a letter to members, who manage $2 trillion.

""The role of some supposedly responsible lawmakers, who have been cheering these events from the side-lines, with a knee-jerk reaction against short selling, is concerning to say the least.""

U.S. Democratic lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said last week that people felt ""everyday people"" were finally able to ""get back"" at those who had all the marbles on Wall Street and forced once hedge fund into an existential crisis. nL1N2K423J

Inglis said finger wagging at hedge funds was not new and short-selling is tightly regulated, requiring positions to be published, allowing others to trade against them.

Some hedge funds have chalked up losses and AIMA said it will help with regulatory investigations.

""Those exposed will have taken it on the chin and will have executed steps to contain losses for their clients, whose savings they manage,"" Inglis said, adding:

""To those commentators who have been clapping with glee at the misfortune of those hedge funds ... what we have witnessed in the past week is a game that has led to a gross distortion in both efficient market functioning and true price determination.""

Well, we‚Äôve seen them try a number of dirty tactics to try and scare us into selling. Short ladders, lying in the media that they closed their position, restricting free trading of a stock, and more. But all of these moves had one thing in common, and failed for the same reason: it showed us that they are DESPERATE for us to SELL, only confirming to us that they do in fact still hold a huge short position. 

So then what could they do to convince us that it‚Äôs over and the short squeeze won‚Äôt ever squoze? The answer is simple: nothing. Stop driving the price down, stop the FUD campaigns, just do... nothing. Let us sweat it out and speculate while the paper handed start to fold and trigger a selloff. The interest they would have to pay on their position is PENNIES compared to the difference if they can manage to close their positions in the $100s instead of the $1,000s. 

Don‚Äôt panic if the price is flat today, or all week, or even next week. It could very well be the next step in their plan. You can‚Äôt expect to make it to Mars without stopping for fuel once you break out of Earth‚Äôs atmosphere üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ.

We know the media said short sellers covered their calls, this tho is a way to ruin you psychologically. When you believe in 1 thing and your hope gets crushed you'll feel sad, but when you believe in 10 things and all your hopes get crushed you'll feel depressed and hopeless. That's what they're trying to do.

They're trying to make you believe they covered their calls but we've seen today they didn't, they're giving you false hopes to later crush them all and make you feel like shit.

This'll probably work on the weakest of us who will sell cause of this, so the price may fall, except for another thing, as counterintuitive as it may sound (and a psychological war often is counterintuitive) they may even buy a lot of shares to let you see those big green candles to later sell everything and make you see the huge red candles caused by their selling and by the other investor's panic selling.

First, I'm not an advisor or some quant with some bullshit MBA from a Top Tier school trying to scare anybody. 

With everybody dropping RH like my ex-wife dropping me for Chad, I wanted to read on the process during the transfer of these accounts. 

I noticed a post where Fidelity was up 700% in transfer requests this weekend. I would assume the same for other non BROKErages. 

I have Fidelity and I use ToS for charting, but I read up on the process for transfer from RH. First you have to pay $75 bucks to get transferred from RH. That's a crock of shit but I guess its still ""free"" trading. 

Secondly, RH will sell your fractional shares prior to transfer through ACATS (This is the system for ""transferring"" shares from one brokerage to another). This will take place prior to T+2 which is the SEC standard. Now when your transfer is taking place you do not have access to trading your stonks at all. Time to bring back the old PornHub..

Thirdly, all your limit orders have been canceled during this process. This means that if GME tanks (HOLD you dumbfuck) you will be out of it and just screaming at the screen seeing dildos (green or red) while your wife is boned by her bf.

Lastly, the process fully takes 10-14 days to ""settle"". You get credit for the stonks at T+2 but there could be restrictions on trading depending on the brokerage. Fidelity does not have this issue...

But broneilbro...what does this mean for GME? Well, kid...

1. RH will clump all the fractional shares from the transferees together and dump them at market per RH 
> ""If you have any fractional shares during a full account transfer, they will be sold, and the resulting funds will be transferred to the other brokerage as cash during a residual sweep."" https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/transfer-stocks-out-of-your-robinhood-account/** 

  These will be gobbled up by hopefully the GMEGang but it will supply shares to the market. Depending on how many full shares this could minimal if assuming a .99 fractional share x RH transferees...

2. The GME shares that are transffered will effectively be ""off the table"" during the ACAT process which will lead to a massive ""group"" HOLD for T+2 days depending on when RH autists transferred out. This should cause a drop in volume since GME retards won't be able to trade but will help out as the shorts cannot buy these shares as they are out of play.

3. The process for getting margin approval and options access could take a few days due to the volume of transferees. This will show up as a general ""pause"" within GME as traders are waiting for account access. This could be good or bad depending on the view. 

4. This mass transfer out of RH will be a blessing to them as they will not have to deal with the GME liquidity funding mechanisms. 

Just my thoughts on everybody fleeing RH...there will be a slight pause but that will give people a chance to poke around the platforms and get used to it prior to going all in on GME...

Yes, all mainstream media sources are demonizing this subreddit and holders of GameStop in any way possible. But THIS IS GOOD! If we, as a bunch of unconnected retards who use this sub have decided we each individually LIKE THE STOCK, then we will all INDIVIDUALLY hold. Let the normies sit this one out. Let anyone with an IQ above 70 sit this one out. They will sell at a low profit and let the shorts off the hook. Let's go back to GME not catching much attention so we can resume with the squeeze. APES TOGETHER STRONG. None of our conviction has faded at all with media blasting us. All this has done is prevent boomers from frenzying into our beloved GME and ruining it by selling such as during the ladder attack.

If there's truly a conspiracy about silver, it's not the bullion. Buying silver (and gold eventually) is something you can't go wrong with. Silver is seriously undervalued and its price is being manipulated down. You see, being long precious metals is basically shorting the dollar. And with the money printer going brrrr there's no doubt that inflation is going brrr aswell.

It's fucking BLATANT how the price is manipulated. Silver is supposedly a trillion market, but the actual silver that's on the surface is much, much less than that. T**here is likely LESS fine silver bullion on the surface than there is fine gold bullion.** Why ? Because we humans use much much more silver than we use gold for industry. Yet we don't extract much much more silver.

Thing is, we've been shown that markets can't be trusted. $SLV is just fucking paper. It's nothing. It's not something that'll get bullion delivered to your house.

# TLDR ; hold on to your precious GMEüíéüôå shares, do not fall for the $SLV trap, secure your future tendies in ACTUAL METAL you can TOUCH and that no Robinhood-like is gonna block you from trading.  ü•úü•úü•úü•ú

Put your sell limit orders at $4K - $5K, or tell your broker to stop lending your shares out. 

There is debate whether or not putting sell limit orders will stop brokers from lending out shares. But at this situation, I find it very odd that many sell orders are suddenly removed without consent. Guess theory does come alive after all, shorters need more shares ;)

This morning I read an article in a newspaper about how ''redditors are collectively hopping on the silver train''. The article in question was from FD, basically the Dutch Financial Times.

It's about the following article;[https://fd.nl/beurs/1372360/gamestop-beleggers-richten-zich-op-zilvermarkt](https://fd.nl/beurs/1372360/gamestop-beleggers-richten-zich-op-zilvermarkt)

&#x200B;

We all know damn well that the ones who bought GME are still holding it, and that no OG WSB member cares about SLV. So I asked them about their sources to justify an article about Redditors buying silver and they replied with these two sources. They basically said that they get first hand information from analysts and that they are not writing anything that is not truthful. Additionally they said they are aware of the market sentiment but that they are also aware of ''redditors driving  up the price of silver''. I sent them eight of the most popular posts of WSB of the past 24 hours to point out the market sentiment (which is GME). They provided these sources for their article;

1. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the\_real\_dd\_on\_slv\_the\_worlds\_biggest\_short/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the_real_dd_on_slv_the_worlds_biggest_short/)
2. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the\_biggest\_short\_squeeze\_in\_the\_world\_slv\_silver/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the_biggest_short_squeeze_in_the_world_slv_silver/)

&#x200B;

One of these posts has even been deleted! I pointed out that the accounts that promote silver are mostly new accounts, or accounts that have been inactive for a long time. They said they did not see any proof for that statement and referred back to two SLV posts here.

TLDR; Media ignoring the actual market sentiment

PS; Yes, I can provide screenshots of the emails I wrote, but they are not in English so I figured there would be no point it posting those in WSB.

Due to the large influx of new users, I think it's a good idea to go over a *very* important aspect of trading -- taxes.

Now, there have been multitudes of sick gains posted over the past weeks. You may be thinking of dropping yours on a new Lambo, and rightly so, but before you do, make sure you determine how deep the Tax Man is going to have his hand in your pockets come next year.

&#x200B;

# Capital Gains

A Capital gain is exactly what you should expect: a gain realized from trading something of value. When you bought 1 GME share for $20 and sold for $500, you realized a $480 capital gain.

Capital gains are taxed through two different schedules in the U.S.: Long-term Capital Gains tax and Short-term Capital Gains tax. Again, as you might suspect, these taxes are applied based on how long you held the capital. **To qualify for the long-term capital gains tax, you must hold the capital for more than one year**. Everything else is taxed as short-term.

Note that this only applies to those without üíéüëê, as you are only taxed on gains made from closing a position (*realized* gains).

&#x200B;

# Long-term Capital Gains

Now, if you saw the original comment by our lord and savior u/DeepFuckingValue and jumped in at the same time, you would qualify for the long-term capital gains tax:

&#x200B;

|$ Amount|Tax Rate|
|:-|:-|
|$0 - $40,000|0%|
| $40,000 - $441,450 |15%|
| $441,450 - ‚àû |20%|

The brackets above represent taxation on a Single taxpayer. [You can find the brackets for Married (filing jointly or separately) and Head of Household here.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp)

&#x200B;

# Short-term Capital Gains

I would imagine that most of you did *not* jump in with DFV over a year ago, and thus are subject to the short-term capital gains tax. Short term capital gains are taxed as regular income, meaning that it is summed with any additional income you make throughout the year at a regular job.

&#x200B;

|$ Amount|Tax Rate|
|:-|:-|
| 0 - $9,875 |10%|
| $9,876 - $40,125 |12%|
| $40,126 - $85,525 |22%|
| $85,526 - $163,300 |24%|
| $163,301 - $207,350 |32%|
| $207,351 - $518,400 |35%|
| $518,400 - ‚àû|37%|

The brackets above represent taxation on a Single taxpayer. [You can find the brackets for Married (filing jointly or separately) and Head of Household here.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101515/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp)

There is a caveat to the tax brackets above -- Federal income tax is applied at a *progressive rate*. 

If you make $100,000 at your job this year and a $70,000 short-term gain with GME, you might expect to pay a 32% tax and owe $54,400. However, you actually would only owe $35,415.50. 

The progressive rate schedule means that the first $9,875 you earn is taxed at 10%, then the next $30,249 ($40,125 - the $9876 which was already taxed at 10%) is taxed at 12%, then the next $45,399 is taxed at 22%, and so on.

&#x200B;

As you can see, it is much more tax advantageous to hold. Even the federal government wants you to hold. **SO HOLD.**

&#x200B;

Disclaimer: I am not a tax professional. This only applies to U.S. residents. The information herein is only in respect to **Federal** tax. There may or may not be state-specific tax as well. There are *many* other factors that may increase or decrease your taxable income. Certain equities/equity derivatives are taxed differently than stated above. If you made bank over the past few weeks, **TALK TO A CPA**. My limited knowledge of tax law could be wrong -- if you see a mistake, leave a comment and I will correct it.

&#x200B;

**tl;dr:** [Ben Franklin once wrote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_and_taxes_(idiom)) that in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except **death and taxes.** Do not spend all of your gains without accounting for taxes. The tax man *will* have you pay in some form or fashion; whether it's in cash, repossession, wage garnishment, or jail is up to you.

Sell calls of AMC of a higher strike price or earlier expiration date.

Problem: The bank prohibited that without any advance notice.

I tried to leg in the trade myself because I learned my bank's multi-order system is not smart enough to do it at a credit (if it happens.)

Result: First part of the trade completed (was able to get a fill) Second part of the trade was unable to be completed because of the error message below:

Was it too ""risky?"" No, because I already bought the calls.

Am I able to do this with other stocks? Yes.

Do I have risk? Yes, for the few seconds of purchasing the calls without an offsetting position. (Which the bank let me take.)

The error message does not change regardless if you have the ability to sell to open covered. (Which requires offsetting calls or actual shares.)

&#x200B;

Their multi-order system is able to accept spreads of other stocks, but not AMC.   This is what happens when you try:
