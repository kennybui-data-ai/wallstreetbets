And was asked to post this as a discussion.

The most important thing is actually **until Friday there** will be another **price** battle in which the short sellers will try to keep as many calls as possible outside the price so that they cannot be executed and the broker does not have to buy them on the market to cover them .  
It is particularly critical because **monthly and weekly calls** expire, as far as I know the highest monthly call was **60c 1/29** and **115c 1/29** (left out the new 200c).

The MM will try everything to push the course **below 60** , **our goal to get to 115** . Until then, **expect massive short attacks** , it will probably be even more blatant than yesterday. Since a price limit is harder to keep higher up, don't be surprised if there is a red tag up until then or the lower limit is 60-80.  
For those of you who don't know what is meant, 100xLimit orders at $ 60 are $ 6000 <$ 11500 100x at $ 115 and easier to hold or buy from autistic people.

And almost most importantly **, put your stop loss out** , the **shortsellers try** to trigger as many as possible with their short sales in order to trigger **a chain reaction of panic selling** .

Remember **yesterday we saw exactly that** , price dumping at its finest, although almost no short position was powered.

Should we be **able to hold the $ 115 by Friday** , the banks (! Not the shortsellers) would have to buy an additional 8 million shares to cover the demand for the calls. To achieve this there is really only the possibility 🚀✋🏻💎🤚🏻,

**Don't be a paper bitch!**

All figures relate to estimates and information or assumptions and observations from DD from here and the Angelsachen forum. Due to the high trading volume, it is not possible to say how the share is currently distributed !!

**This is not a financial advice, but an autistic one.** **Always invest wisely and make your own decisions.**

And now relax America won't open for another 4 hours anyway.

Keeping holding and relax.**

With a lot of chatter going around and some excellent DD being shared with lots of technical analysis there still seems to be doubt as to 1) If the squeeze is happening, and 2) How to capitalize on it.  Please spend a few minutes reading this so you're more informed as a trader (even if this is your first time being a trader).  This is not a technical analysis but more a plain English guide:

1. **Crazy price volatility:** I think this one is self-explanatory but if you're wondering what price volatility looks like go check out a Google chart from the past week or so.  A stock moving up 20%+ day after day after day is not typical.
2. **Those who stand to lose the most go on the offensive:** At this point it is fairly well established that WSB has many user accounts being used for a variety of purposes, but at the moment many of those accounts are trying to drum up emotional responses to counter the short squeeze.  People hyping new tickers with far less short-term upside, saying that the facts are not true (remember kids: you're entitled to opinions but not your own facts).
3. **Those who stand to lose are taking MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR life lines:** Again, this so self-explanatory but yet still not all of us believe that a squeeze is happening.  During the 2008/2009 crash there were MAJOR US BANKS that were getting $2-5BN in bailout money to prevent the entire economy from collapsing.  Yesterday a relatively small hedge fund posing ZERO systemic risk took a $2.75BN bailout that without it would have likely seen them disappear from the system with ZERO impact to our greater economy as a whole.
4. **Confusion:** Have you noticed that some of the ""smartest guys in the room"" can't seem to agree on television and in the media as to what is going on??  If you actually believe that there is some debate going on amongst the experienced and elite Wall Street types then there may be no hope for you in life.  Con artists prey on the gullible and you will be a slaughtered sheep soon.
5. **Just f-ing hold if you like money!!:** If the above four bullet points haven't convinced you then nothing will so just sit back, relax, and let the men do our work.  If your wrists get weak and your paper hands get so feeble that you sell at these low prices then we (the real men of this sub) are better off without you owning the stock anyway.  AND STOP BUYING OPTIONS YOU STUPID IDIOTS! Calls were great to have bought in 2019, even into mid-to-late 2020, but the price you're paying for them now is a rip-off.  AND, the volatility on the price means your chances of losing money have never been better!

Warren Buffett has famously said at multiple shareholder meetings that he doesn't want people owning Berkshire stock if they're the type of *investor* that trades in and out of positions.  He wants long-holders, people that believe in the mission of the company, believe in the management, and want to get wealthy, NOT RICH.

**You might be in the middle of something that will not happen to you again EVER in your investing life, or perhaps only a handful of times from now until you retire.  Don't screw it up by thinking that jumping off the fastest moving train, and one that is unique and a statistical anomaly, is going to happen again on some other ticker that has gotten the unfortunate meme status that the elite are trying to trick you into right now.**

NOK, BB, and others may all go up in the future and if you want to invest in them then you should wait.  How long??  Who knows.  And who cares?!?!?  You're probably in your 20's or even teens, you have plenty of time to invest in many good companies in your lifetime but quite likely NONE will go through this kind of movement over a period of a few weeks and if you sell now (you paper handed p-ssy) you will never forgive yourself.  HOLD, be patient, let the shorts bleed themselves to death, and in the meantime go focus on something other than Reddit!

Good luck to all.

***EDIT: I somehow forgot to add positions.  In keeping with the suggestion of others not to broadcast exact holdings (don't show the enemies your positions!) I will just say I have a high six-figure position of SHARES ONLY and I haven't even thought about selling for a moment.  This is not my biggest holding and my life won't be changed whether it eventually settles at $50/share or $500/share and YOURS WON'T EITHER SO BE STRONG.***

***EDIT II: Stop calling it a ""Loss"" if you bought at $X and it is now below $X.  An actual loss has not occurred until AFTER you sell, and if you don't sell then you won't lose.  It is not more complicated than that.  Seasoned investors (which are on the other side of every trade that you do) rely on you being emotional because they are using a computer with no emotion at all.  Don't be the sucker and don't actually lose money when instead you could actually have a gain!***"|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163919.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['RMENT', 'DD', 'I', 'A', 'WSB', 'LLION', 'OLLAR', 'MAJOR', 'US', 'BANKS', 'BN', 'ZERO', 'BN', 'ZERO', 'AND', 'STOP', 'UYING', 'TIONS', 'YOU', 'TUPID', 'DIOTS', 'AND', 'NOT', 'RICH', 'EVER', 'NOK', 'BB', 'NONE', 'HOLD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'HARES', 'ONLY', 'I', 'YOURS', 'T', 'ITHER', 'SO', 'BE', 'TRONG', 'EDIT', '$X', '$X', 'AFTER']|['DD', 'A', 'EVER', 'NOK', 'T', 'SO', 'X', 'X']

NOK sells for less than 5$, the cheap price appeals to retailers (retards) in the same way PLTR and GME's less than 30$ a share did for those who cant afford TSLA. I mean you can buy 100 stocks of NOK for less than 500$. think about that. the perfect distraction.

1:  NOK is an NEM. do you know who else is an NEM, Huawei, Ericsson, ZTE. hell even Samsung has aggressivly entered the market a couple of years ago and are strongly positioning themselves especially after Trump banned ZTE and Huawei.
these NEMs are called HENZ (Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia, ZTE) then changed to HENS as samsung grabbed ZTE by their banned balls. all these guys have been involved heavily in 5G. I know that from my 5G centric company.
EDIT: by centric I mean F500 at the heart of the 5G ecosystem.

2: most of the first world is almost done with 5G. yes infrastructure wise done. Im not talking about Zimbabwe (even though Huawei is clear winner in africa btw). 
btw for U.S smooth brains who cant think about the rest of the world, Verizon invested a lot in their 5G infrastructure and towers already, the best in NOT yet to come, it has already been done. AT&T are 90% done, they did a gay way in which all they need is a software update to switch to 5G from LTE. yes there is still a lot of money to be made in 5G market, but thats for full layer solutions, including application layer. I kid you not but people especially in the wireless infrastructure are looking at 6G now... *cough* samsung *cough*

3: NOK is a good company for INVESTING LONG TERM.  they have been early adapters for 5G in their strategy initiative and their execution plan. but that was just the necessarily of growth and survival. lol.of course they got in 5G! what else would they have done. it is the same way how they are going to get in 6G as well and 7G later... you smooth brains saying ""WoW 5G!"" is like looking at a house flipper guy by profession, who buys houses then flips them and sells them, and you retard say, this guy must be on the moon cause he keeps buying houses! well no shit idiots its what they do.

listen, I like NOK, great guys. but dont be fucking retards falling for the bots and implants by MM and melvin capital. NOK isnt going to moon. they are going to steadily grow so take that shit back to r/investing.

tldr; nothing special about NOK other than the cheap price tag ideal by MM to distract paper hands, HOLD your GME and squeeze."|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163920.csv|StockTicker|['G', 'STOP', 'TTING', 'BOTS', 'VINCE', 'YOU', 'NOK', 'IS', 'GONNA']|['G', 'NOK']|['GME', 'NOK', 'PLTR', 'TSLA', 'I', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NEM', 'NEM', 'ZTE', 'ZTE', 'HENZ', 'HENS', 'ZTE', 'G', 'I', 'G', 'I', 'G', 'G', 'U', 'S', 'G', 'NOT', 'T', 'G', 'LTE', 'G', 'I', 'G', 'NOK', 'STING', 'LONG', 'TERM', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'W', 'G', 'I', 'NOK', 'MM', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'MM', 'HOLD', 'GME']|['GME', 'NOK', 'TSLA', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NEM', 'NEM', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'S', 'G', 'T', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'NOK', 'LONG', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'W', 'G', 'NOK', 'MM', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'MM', 'GME']

Check out my math:

* As of Jan 22 2021 close, they were [down 30%](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/steve-cohen-ken-griffin-invest-3-billion-gamestop-short-seller-2021-1-1030003305). They had [13.1 bn AUM](https://aum13f.com/firm/melvin-capital-management-lp) as of Mar 2020 (assuming this doesn't change), that's a **loss of $3.9 bn as of Jan 22 2021**.
* During this time, GME increased $46.95 (from $17.9 to $64.85). **AKA for every $11.95 increase in GME price, Melvin loses $1bn.**

GME price as I am writing this is $103.46. That means:

* **Since the $2.75bn bailout, Melvin has lost another $3.2 bn or 25%.**

This is a big moment. A tug of war between tradition and the future.

Hedge fund managers live in the past, and continue to look down upon the retail investors. They truly believe that we, the average retail investors, don't know anything about finances or the market (which may be true), and we're just gambling our money away.

We don't know any better. WE NEED HEDGE FUND MANAGERS TO TELL US WHAT TO DO! SAVE US!

This is the world they want to live in. This was the past.

Remember that scene from the Sopranos, where Tony's wife calls to buy 5000 shares of Webonics, after she was manipulated emotionally to so?  Institutions and hedge funds want us to be stuck in that world.

They're scared of the future.

They're scared because, so much information is available for free now. THere's no more fees for trading. We have large communities that discuss stocks and trading openly.

We can think and make decisions for ourselves, which scares the FUCK out of old school institutions and hedge funds.

Fuck them all. This affects every single one of you, whether or not you're holding $GME.

I am more than confident to say that a series of Whales have come to battle alongside with us retail shareholders. The Amount of volume and the amount of capital that was thrown at this stock today was nothing short of remarkable. The battle started at 11:01am EST, when the first short attack began, and the stock was able to find the floor at about $97.02. What followed was absolutely mind blowing.

For the next nearly two hours there was a series of extremely systematic buying. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that the whales have come to our aid. If you look at the chart below you will see that every 45 minutes there is a short attack of some sort and that attack is was denied every single time. Now I am not doubting at all in the strenght of out community, but the only folks out there with this much capital are other insitututions that want in on this historical event.

That's right I beleive at this time the Rohirrim has arrived lead by a mass of insitutional investors that want a slice of that 2.75 Billion dollar bail out. And they are willing to shell out at premium prices to bleed Melvin Capital Dry. There is still 30 minutes left in this session, lets just see how this plays out.

This is just an observation with rough hypothesis based on today's oberserved trading activity and is not advice.

EDIT: Just a Quick Update

Looks like according to Level two trading, there is a significant ""Sell Wall"" at $150 for about 54k shares. So there is going to need to be some significant volume to push through that level, which is completely possible at the open.

&#x200B;

Day starts with a big gap-up to 95 that is immediately defended. Once again, the 95 price was pivot to the day. First half of the trading with lower than usual volume. The main highlight being the smashing the buy button at $80. Notice how fast and concentrated those candles go up. This is not retail chasing prices.

MMs defended the 95 level during the morning as borrowing fees increased to over 80%. This should tell you something about what was going on in the market. Low volume, short fee jumps, tactical buying moves at certain levels and tightening trading range. At noon, all hell breaks lose.   


Rising volume with rising prices once again, all the way to the other pivot point at $115: the highest open interest strike of 1/29. From here on, its an open highway to tendie town. 

&#x200B;

Unlike yesterday (and the days before), the people buying at this levels are not retailers nor MM hedging. I also don't think is much covering going on (yet). The volume and candles are flowing just on the limit of the circuit breakers as to not lose momentum. Once it starts reaching the 10% threshold, it decelerates ever so slightly as to keep the momentum and avoid trading halts. This is sophisticated.

&#x200B;

Tomorrow I'll be looking for consolidation points to accumulate. Keep tracking OI volumes and key pivot points. They will tell you what's going on.

The early morning action was unremarkable considering events of the last week. Ground was taken and lost between Cohen's Cohorts in the 80th and the battle hardened 95th. This is ground that has been fought over time and again, and I hope to never see it again for the remainder of my days.

**9:30 AM - 12:30 PM**

I fear I have asked too much of my men. They have already proved their worth to me a thousand times over and then a thousand again, but still I ask them to push. Ground continues to be taken and lost in an endless circle over the same bloody ground. Privately, I despair for the men of the 159th Weaponized Autists that were left stranded and wanting for reinforcements in yesterday's fighting. Every ounce of my strength is now focused on their safe return. Privately, I despair.

**12:30 PM - 1:00 PM**

Operation FD has been launched. The men of the 100th in conjunction with elite troops from the 101st Asperger's Airborne have launched a coordinated blitz assault. Pray for us.

**1:00 PM - 2:30 PM**

The enemy has been taken completely unawares. We're seeing men feared lost from the 110th and 120th trickle back to camp. Decisive gains have been made across the line. Each time we visit, enemy resolve weakens. I was a fool to have despaired. I know the men and women I fight with. The men of the 150th are fighting for their lives, but mark my words, we are coming.

**2:30 PM - 4:00 PM**

It is my pleasure to report that all stranded troops of the 120th, 130th and 140th have been joined, and despite their weariness continue to fight with a zeal that even the finest scribes known to man could not capture in words. As our troops massed alongside the 150th, General Left and his horde of crayons were seen retreating to ground that has not yet been contested. Fresh troops from the 200th have been brought up alongside elite ground units from Seal Team 160.

Tomorrow we ride to uncharted territory.

&#x200B;

edit: In a crushing blow to the enemy, Seal Team 160 obliterated all resistance in it's path. Troops are being rushed in from the 200th, 210th and 220th. Even reserve troops from the 230th saw brief action. The day is ours."|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163933.csv|StockTicker|['GME', 'AM']|['GME', 'AM']|['AM', 'I', 'AM', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'PM', 'FD', 'PM', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'PM']|['AM', 'AM', 'PM', 'PM', 'PM']

I think it's important to see how the sentiment is getting manipulated from outside actors trying to spread FUD- fear, uncertainty, doubt.



1) The most obvious and harmless kind of sentiment-manipulation happens via newspapers and the TV. It's what you'd expect Boomers to write about us. Not accurate at all and probably done out of favor for Hedgefund friends, but also having a very limited effect in times of Reddit, Facebook and Youtube.



2)The weirder part is how sentiment is manipulated on WSB itself. Low karma accounts spreading some kind of hype around low-energy stocks in this subreddit and other stock related subreddits, trying to divert attention. It's not far fetched at all that some of these are hired actors (if I was a billionaire with tons to lose, I'd invest in people trying to divert attention from the hype stock). There's also some ""shouldn't we sell here? Is it really going higher?"" Posts that just feel **off**, like written by someone that isn't molded by WSB lingo. Like by an outsider.



3)Price action. Obviously price action is manipulated to make you doubt yourself and to suppress the price. For this, short spikes that get sold off rapidly is to be expected, because it increases the readiness to take profits at the ""next"" spike. I think that is what we saw yesterday 




What can you do against this?

First; BE AWARE THAT IT IS HAPPENING. Then you can ignore it.


Second; read DD posts and make rational decisions.


Third; Set a price target and stick to it. Don't try to play the swings, instead just buy&hold for your PT.


Fourth; downvote & report shills, share this post to increase awareness about the manipulation and spread positive sentiment if you are bullish. With this I don't mean tons of 🚀🚀🚀 or ""1000 is not a meme"" (it is, kind of).

I mean you should comment your legit bull thesis as an answer to FUD.

For reasons not publicly available, Donny Foss acquired 3.5 million shares of GME on or about February 28, 2020.

My economic teacher, yes I’m a 17 year old degenerate, and I have been arguing all year about tesla, and now GME. He’s been teaching our class about bubbles (GME is a bubble it just hasn’t popped yet, there’s still profits to be made) in the market and is always talking down to me like I’ve got no knowledge in the stock market. He kept saying GME had no chance to pass $60 today because of hedge funds and such. I can’t bringing up that a short squeeze was possible. 

Today we argued abt GME. I told him it was going to the moon, talked about the short sellers, shitron and such. He called WSB a bunch of idiot millennials who will go broke, said the same thing about tesla. Today I had the honor of telling him to check GME when the ticker was at +79%. He stared at me pissed off and I said “how are your puts now e-trader”.

Ik the dudes a ton smarter then me on economics I just thought it was funny 

Boys we took a dub today. All of that gets left behind us if we sell. Don’t let them win.

At open GME ripped and LB/BABA/FISV (Melvin's holdings) took a complete shit because they started liquidating to pay for GME, then they got bailed out and bought their shares back.

Average volume of LB is 3m shares. Melvin sold 1M in an hour and tanked the share price 10% on Monday. Melvin owns 25M shares of LB, or 1/9th of the entire float.

LB closed 20% of their Victoria's Secret stores this year due to covid, and Amazon is literally killing them.

If you want a low premium play, buy LB puts for this GME squeeze.

**EDIT:** You want LB puts instead of their other holdings because LB is their holding with the highest percentage of float.

>The market has come to its lowest form. This is even crazier than Tilray (TLRY) [see below] and Tesla (TSLA). The Reddit crowd apparently said, “Let’s find a company that’s completely dead – and because everyone knows that, there’s a big short interest – and engineer a short squeeze.”

>Even so, my losses have been minimal – and I’m making it back by selling ridiculously priced calls. For example, when the stock was at $75 today, I was getting paid $18 for $90 strike calls and $14 for at-the-money calls that expire on Friday!

I’m an avid lurker on WSB and have been keenly following the GME saga. Although I haven’t actually gone around to putting any skin in the game myself due to my employment trading restrictions, I had a thought if it’s not already being actively employed, which it may very well be. 

GME is up 600%+ YTD and yet the short interest still remains 138%+ of float. The short squeeze that everyone is fighting for hasn’t actually happened or even started yet. The shorts who have gotten squeezed out have been quickly replaced by even more new shorts. There have been articles stating the short interest is even higher today than it was last week. So my question becomes, where the fuck are the shorts getting so much borrow from? Who is lending them all these shares? Now, anyone who uses a margin account basically agrees to have their broker lend your shares on their behalf anytime. You have to explicitly stop your broker from lending out your shares. I’m sure most of you know this, but I just wanted to flag so people can be actively aware that they can stop their shares from being lent out to shorts which may help bring on the squeeze. Who knows what percentage of float the WSB community is lending to these shorts but it must be meaningful I’m sure. Hell if Cohen with his 12.9% stake pulled any borrow I’m sure he could singlehandedly catalyze the real squeeze. 

EDIT: as per comments below, having GTC sell limit orders apparently does NOT stop your broker from lending out your shares. You’ll have to contact the broker and probably have to have an all cash account (?). Most of you guys aren’t using margin for GME anyways so hopefully there’s a real way for the majority here to stop their shares from being lent out. https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-putting-a-high-limit-sell-order-will-prevent-shorts-from-borrowing-your-shares

Everyone should be calling their brokers to find out how and if they can stop their shares from being lent out. At this point, it’s worth the time putting in the call. 

I’m just a guy who wants to see the squeeze actually happen and see what price GME can reach when the squeeze is done. As of right now it seems like both sides are going strong and the shorts aren’t backing down so you need all the tricks up your sleeve you can get.

Last week I had 10k to my name. Come Friday I lost another grand bringing my portfolio down to 9k in total. I had a full week of bleeding value from 26k due to holding tesla calls hoping that there'd be an earnings run-up. Then on Friday I decided I had had enough. I knew Gamestop was doing well and it was sitting around 35 dollars so I figured why not? I threw 7 thousand dollars at it between calls dating for 1/22-1/29 with the highest one being about a $60 strike. Then came 10am Friday morning 1/22.

Gamestop shot up an astronomical amount breaching over 100% at one point. This sent my account flying. First 20k, then 30, then 40 and 50. It finally settled around 36k for the day for a whopping 29 thousand dollar gain for the day. I couldn't believe it!

Come Monday (yesterday) I bought even more shares and even more calls. I bought expirations of 1/29-2/5 calls with strikes ranging from 75-130. This drove my account up even further. I opened Monday at 63k, from there it quickly rushes and topped around 170k for a huge 300% 110k gain for the day. I didn't sell though. Then came the halts. The stock quickly fell all the way from 155 down to 60/share. I had gone from 170k to 12k in an instant. But I wasn't discouraged. When the halt ended I was stressed but I wasn't going to be discouraged. I bought only a couple more shares and held through the volatility. My account closed yesterday at 58k - I was down from the morning open but up on the day.

Now we are at the present. My account climbed from from 58k from yesterdays close to 72k at open this morning. I knew what kind of day I was in for from yesterdays events but this time I was ready. I would not paper hand and I would not miss the rocket! I clutched onto my calls and I held on tight to my shares. My account closed today at a new high of 143 thousand dollars. I sold my calls dated for this coming Friday (1/29) to secure some cash. I withdrew 10 thousand and the other 35k I will use to gather more shares. 

I'm not going to sit here and pretend I'm some sort of marketing genius. At the end of the day I got very lucky and timed my play right before rush. 

Gamestop was a place I spent a lot of time growing at growing up. They were my favorite place to buy games from! They may have only offered me 20 cents in-store credit for my old Xbox 360 and a handful of games. But what they didn't tell me is that one day they'd give me far more than that. Today Gamestop paid for my college tuition for the remaining 3 years I have in college. Thank you Gamestop. And thank you everyone here. I love you all."|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163935.csv|StockTicker|['GME', 'K', 'YOLO']|['GME', 'K']|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']|[]

“There’s a whole group of investors who really don’t care about the inherent value of a company,” he said. “They just care if there’s someone else who will pay a higher price.”

so says  John Stark, a lecturer at Duke Law who previously led the SEC’s Office of Internet Enforcement, in the FT

Now that Melvin is bankrupt, their position goes to their broker which are the big banks. Now, the banks want to close the position, but there are no paper hands in GME. They want to pay up, with Melvin money but there is none.

They can't even liquidate Melvin long portfolio and pay for their grim mistakes, a sacrifice offering not available.

So here is the problem, we can't win against the banks. If we are winning against the bank, our big boys in GME will get a talk with big brother.

Now if you read my post history you will find out that I am permabull holding $BB shares from $3 to $20. This is not why I am writing this DD on 🚀GME🚀, no, full stop. I want 🚀GME🚀 brothers to go to one trillion dollars, because I know at the end of the day some of that will come to the deep value play of $BB.

Then there is a big problem, now the problem is not big right now since the market cap is only 10B on   🚀 GME  🚀 , but lets say we 10x again and head to 100B, one trillion, then this will bring down big banks.

**April 2020** \- Long story short, I started in April 2020 right after COVID, whereby I got introduced to some 'gurus'/paid courses to learn basic options strategies. Bought calls on everything tech, FB, AMD, SE, NVDA, PTON, FSLY, etc, etc. Started to find that ""money was so easy to make"" and even took out bank loans.

**August 2020** \- Indices rally all day everyday, stonks only go up, earnings always beat and stonks rally, made $175k in only 3/4 months.

**September 2020** \- Crashed hard for 3 days, and due to poor risk management with absolutely ZERO take profit / stop losses, watched ALL my tech calls bleed into oblivion. Profit got wiped out and I was literally back at breakeven. Wasted 4/5 months of my time, had no job, and was in debt. Went into semi-depression.

**October 2020** \- Figured I had to find get my money back, all I needed was just ONE good play to go all-in, and I would recover. Or at least that's what I told myself. Found this guy NoProblemChanging who seemed to be really accurate at predicting the markets - literally followed the advice of a stranger on WSB and went all in on puts due to his bearish views and certainty that the market was going to crash.

**November 2020** \- As we all know, everyone was expecting elections to be a shitshow but vaccine news rallied the markets with multiple gap ups and stuff. **By now I was already down $100k and was depressed. Imagine having made easy money ($175k in 4 months) in the greatest bull market of all time, only to lose it all in 3 days and even going negative, while seeing every stonk around me go up everyday while my puts bled all day. Not going to lie, at this moment I felt like $ROPEing although logically I know $100k is money that can still be earned back.**

I was so desperate at this moment that I HAD to find something that I could ALL IN and GUARANTEED to make money. Then, I found $GME. I found u/DeepFuckingValue and that's when I climbed into the rabbit hole, knowing it was a fundamentally undervalued company. Bought around $15\~. Huge credit to GMEShortSqueeze and u/Uberkikz11 as well.

**December 2020** \- By this time, I was pretty much already all in $GME but I hedged with CCs / sold some of my calls WAY TOO EARLY. **To put it into perspective, if I didn't touch my positions at all until today, I would have been around $3m, but as of now I'm only around $1.4m. Regardless, I am grateful!**

**January 2021** \- I've joined the 2 comma club officially! Finally hit my milestone.

**TLDR; made easy money on the rally after COVID in 4 months, lost it all in 3 days due to poor risk management and even went negative, briefly experienced depression and felt like $ROPEing, found a good company $GME, went all in with conviction, emerged stronger than ever.  💎🙌  🚀 🚀 🚀  🚀 🚀 🚀  If I can do it, so can you.**

So here it is. 

&#x200B;

CRSR - Corsair Gaming

&#x200B;

Net Revenue for Q3 was $457.1 million - 60.7% increase year-over-year.

&#x200B;

Gross Profit was 127.9 Million an increase of 112% year-over year with gross margin of 28%.

&#x200B;

This was BEFORE Christmas, Black Friday, and winter break. These are going to skyrocket even further. 

&#x200B;

For Q4 The Preliminary Financial Results are as follows:

&#x200B;

Net Revenue to be about 1.7 Billion

&#x200B;

Net income was around 101 Million 

&#x200B;

The Market Cap for this stock is \~3.31 B and their Revenue for Q4 is half of that? Insane. I'm likely expecting it to be way over the estimations above just like when they doubled expectations the quarter before. All kids have  had to do all lockdown/winter break is play on their PC's, Consoles, and your wive's boyfriends PC. The floor for this is 35$ as shown by the past month and a half and It peaked at 51$. I have a price target of at least 55$ and possible 60$+ Corsair also owns Elgato.

&#x200B;

These numbers aren't going to drop either after COVID. When you invest this much money into a gaming setup for you or your child or whatever. They will keep putting money in. When their mouse breaks from smashing it after losing an online game like the baby they are. Or perhaps after they spill their Mountain Dew all over their mousepad? A lot of things that this pandemic has made us accustomed to are here to stay. I bought a bunch of CRSR Equipment a few years back and I still love it and have gifted the mousepads. I have bought every single dip the past month and I'm waiting for my big payday to mars   🚀     🚀     🚀  

&#x200B;

This is also just good long term if you don't want to play the options game (IV is really high right now premiums a bit much for my taste. 

&#x200B;

I listened into their last earnings call and they really know the esports industry and what to do with it. 

&#x200B;

They are expected to blowout earnings again. I sure as hell am not going to miss out on this like I missed on GME and partly BB.

&#x200B;

Obviously none of this is investment advice and please do your own DD. I'm just a brainlet with the robinhood app who gets high off gaming and gambling. 

&#x200B;

Positions: 305 Shares - I had 40$ Calls in December but took profits on them no longer holding.

So, these numbers are pretty indicative of the extremely bullish market sentiment regarding Nokia, which on its own is great for both the company and investors. But how could these options drive the price of NOK?

Current total Call Options ($5, $7, $10) = 1,008,515 = 100,851,500 shares

&#x200B;

Now let's look at the top institutional holders of NOK as of 29 September 2020:

[From cnn.com](https://preview.redd.it/puthg1tuyqd61.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef33064e0d9f0b78593de2701929d20353f2bc2e)

In mid February, the new 13f filings will be released so that we can see up-to-date institutional holdings. What will that tell us? Basically, we'll be able to look at the big boys who are writing these option contracts to determine whether or not they have adequately covered.

What happens if they didn't hedge their calls? As the price rises over $5, $7, and $10 we will see very high volume buys so that these institutions can manage their risk.

**Alternatively, we can look at the charts to see if this is already happening.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Unfortunately there is no data for what the OI for $4.50 calls were on 25 Jan 2021, so this is what we'll have to use.

|Type|Strike Price|Open Interest Total|Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Call|$4.50|43,879|4,387,900|
|Call|$5.00|459,590|45,959,000|

On 25 January, immediately before opening, the stock price hit $4.50 which triggered a massive buy from institutional holders who had written those call options.

[26 Jan 2021 Market Open](https://preview.redd.it/4k7lo0ia6rd61.png?width=278&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee061d431c2993b37e14f2ced3aad1a27a90b1d1)

On 26 January, immediately before market opening, the stock price his $5.00 which triggered a massive buy from institutional holders followed by what looks to be high volume short-selling from institutions to cover the \~100,000+ Put options that are in the market.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**What does this all mean?**

Price volatility/ramping is already happening. More people are buying both ITM and OTM calls, and the institutions who write them are already needing to buy shares in order to cover. This will continue to happen as NOK pushes beyond the $5 mark.

It also means that nearly ALL Put options at $5 have been covered thus far, which means that we shouldn't expect to see the price get forced downward like this morning again unless high volumes of put options get purchased again at $5 strike.

If you are holding this stock long or short, don't be intimidated by the high volatility.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR**

Today was really high volatility around $5 as institutions covered their call/put options. They covered nearly every put option, which means **we shouldn't expect any significant downward volatility like today going forward until we reach the next big Put option strike prices. Keep an eye on $5 strike Put volume and Open Interest.**"|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163932.csv|StockTicker|['NOK']|['NOK']|['I', 'I', 'I', 'NOK', 'DR', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'OI', 'ITM', 'OTM', 'NOK', 'ALL']|['NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'OI', 'NOK', 'ALL']

For a brief moment, VW was the most valuable company on Earth during the infinity squeeze of 2008.  What would it take for $GME to do that?  

Well currently Apple is the most valuable company on Earth with a market cap of 2.41 trillion dollars.  GameStop has 70 million shares outstanding.  

That would be an infinity short squeeze to $34,000 to momentarily become the most valuable company on Earth.  
  
I don’t know if that’s possible, but just some fun food for thots.

So, let's take a look at Melvin's AUM and what they own:

You'll notice two fairly liquid stocks: $1.5B of BABA, and $1.2B of EXPE.

Let's look at BABA after hours:

This is based off the closest strike price of 150 at the close and the pricing of puts and calls for this level.

Market makers are not pricing GME to go above 220.58  or below 79.50 by the 29th Jan. Above or below those amounts they will start to loose against the options they sold and will need to either defend that level or join the buying to hedge.

TLDR at the bottom.** 

This has come up a few times, so as a non-finance professional I want to offer some financial non-advice to anyone who has just come into a lot of money and is considering paying off their student loans right now. 

[RIGHT NOW FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS ARE FROZEN](https://studentloanhero.com/featured/student-loan-relief-extended/) until September. You aren't obligated to repay until then, and no interest is accruing. 

**PAYING OFF ZERO-INTEREST DEBT EARLY IS FUCKING STUPID.** 

That means you have until September to allow your money to keep growing, either by investing (obligatory all investments carry risk disclaimer), saving in a boomer CD, or saving in a boomer high-yield savings account. Even if my GME tendies only grew by $100 between now and then, it's still the better financial decision to grow my money and pay later than pay now.

AM I GETTING THROUGH TO YOU SMOOTH BRAINS?

Even if you have a private loan, if your interest rate is LOW ENOUGH (like less than 5%), some people (not me because I'm not a financial professional) might even say it's better to keep your money somewhere where it earns more interest, instead of paying off your loans in full. This is called interest arbitrage. 

Congratulations on all the new tendies! But for the love of god please don't be the bad kind of stupid.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Paying off zero-interest debt early is stupid as shit. Find a way to let your money continue to grow until payments resume in September.

We've all seen the memes, and the convincing rants, but here I present something different.

The horizontal blue lines with their price marked on the right, are going to be critical levels during the march upward. You can see that the $25-$40 are is going to be a helluva fight, but its a straight shot up to $70 from that point. Above $70, looks like room to high $80s-low$90s, then absolute chaos to the top with ATH at $148. There will be many unforeseen events along the way, and we can not plan for everything.  

The current levels that we are in need to be held until then. We just had a massive gap up the past couple days, so don't be discouraged if BB flails around, and seems stagnant for the next few days, it is natural. Just buy up every dip and we will be knocking on the $40-$70 area in no time.

HEAR THIS!: 

I am in no way trying to take away from the GME momo. I am in the thick of it with the rest of you tards, and will be until the very end. BB has been, and will continue to be a huge play for months to come, and we should all be excited about that. There is no need to have a competition right now, we need to stick together, seeing how the suits are trying to incite rifts within. Stay strong. The tendie Kingdom is vast, and we shall be there in step, together. 

🚀$BB💪$GME🚀

Disclaimer: I am a retard with a computer, not a qualified suit to give you investment advice. This is merely a technical perspective, from my point of view. I am long in GME and BB, and I will continue to buy both.

It was up roughly 50% to ~$225 in after hours.

In my opinion the short squeeze isn't over, but I think there will be an avalanche down tomorrow at open with multiple trading halts.  People will likely sell at 200+.  I expect it to rise again after the bloodbath.

I am not scared.  I took my theta gains and put my spacesuit on.  I'm going to the fucking moon.  I've got salvos of trailing buy stop orders ready to be strike at a moment's notice at the drops.

Be smart if drops happen.  Have a plan, lie in wait, and pounce.

If you have the insane risk tolerance for this, I think it's worth it.  If it dips I'm buying calls at several steps and holding one of those until this stock goes nuclear.

Good luck in this anarchy.

Hey, it's your boy ~~Chimpu~~ Tsukune Surprise.

This past weekend I posted some DD on the squeezes.  Yes, fucking plural you illiterate retard.

Many of you messaged me and said you enjoyed it.  Although I'm not sure how many people could actually read it.  I think most of you liked the pretty colors and lines.

[Here's my original post on the squeezes and DD.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4bnfr/moatadd_for_the_moass_there_will_be_more_than_one/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

I updated my TA for today's market close.  The TA does not include the AH absolute face ripping toboggan ride on your mom's river of squirt.  So whatever is in the document- just add some Peter North ropes of extra Gentleman's Relish (TM) to the top.

[Here's the the new file here for your masturbatory needs.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UvgkRd3LT7msm1vkHGOqq9kx4FU_suAz/view?usp=sharing)  Just scroll to the bottom for the updated technicals.  I kept the background DD in the document for you shit fuckers that haven't read it yet.

I'm still recording the audio book version for those of you busy licking fucking windows.

Here's the summary of what has changed.  Tighten your helmets and bibs.

I’ll tell you now that $GME was and is a historical moment and I’d like to congratulate all who were part of it and still continue to be. For those who don’t really know why $GME has been rising so drastically; it’s because of its short interest. $GME had a short interest of 138%, more than double the percentage of the next most shorted stock in all of the market. $GME is not a company that’s going to succeed, it was merely a play to get gains off a short squeeze, but you already knew that. The squeeze can still continue and may continue to do so, however the awareness of WSB is growing larger and larger very quickly. Which means more people will want to start taking their profits, and some will even try to continue to short $GME. It could only continue to rise if people do NOT sell and only more shares are bought, which is unpredictable. Just know that $GME is something that happens once in a blue moon and we’ll be required to go back to our peasant 200% gains instead of 800%.

Which is why I’m here to give you the next best play, that focuses solely on predictability. Now it won’t cone as a surprise to say this ticker is $PLTR. I’m a longtime $PLTR holder but only because it proposes a huge opportunity if executed well, and slightly less significant opportunity if butchered. Either way, there’s opportunity.

IMPORTANT SECTION 🚀:
Lockup is coming very very quickly, upon lockup ending insiders will be able to sell their shares for the first time since the stock has been $10. The stock has more than tripled and there’s no doubt that tons of positions will be sold. Currently $PLTR has 20% of shares available to be publicly traded and of that percentage; majority is held by the general public or retail investors (us). The other 80% of shares are being held in lockup by insiders and cannot be traded publicly until lockup ends. If chunks of these shares are sold upon lockup ending, and general public happens to claim majority of the 80% too, then we control the stock entirely. The only way this is possible is if everyone literally buys anything they can with everything they can right upon lockup ending. 

TL;DR: General public needs to control majority shares when insiders are finally able to sell their positions when lockup ends. We currently own majority of the 20% that’s publicly available.

Positions: PLTR 800 shares @25.2

A bunch of Asperger's, WoW playing, poor ""kids"" managed to cause an epic squeeze in $GME. Make no mistake you have the attention of the big boys NOW.

&nbsp;

Now an absolute giant in the hedge fund world has gotten in, and it is against WSB. Ken Griffin (he has a camera in his office that shows his luxury car collection in the garage) may not be a name you know, but he is  a HUGE name in the hedge and quant fund world. After today and likely tomorrow, he is at risk of losing 2 Billion plus in his fund. I repeat he will NOT let this happen.

&nbsp;

These are the type of guys who do insider trading for fun at their country club. They front run clients, put out fake news stories, have direct links to the SEC board, and would literally murder everyone in here to increase their personal wealth.

&nbsp;


**What to expect  from them next:**


1. Convince (strongarm) the SEC to completely HALT trading on GME. They will make up a bullshit excuse, and force the exchange to stop allowing trades on the stock.

2. Hire big name attorneys, and force reddit to shut down WSB   
3. Pressure $GME executives to issue NEW shares at this price, and bail the shorts out. This is pretty easy for them to do. You have to understand almost all the people at this level of wealth know each other. Its a small club. 

&nbsp;



**What can you do to stop this:**

1. Bring attention to their tactics via going to the media (Twitter, NYT, Senator Elizabeth Warren or the like)

2. File SEC complaints that show that NAKED short selling is happening on GME, and is creating an actual organic move. There are more shares SHORT than their are FLOAT (traded in every day trading). This means if they covered their shorts they would have to buy every single share outstanding, and another 30% that are not actively traded.

I haven't talked to my WS people on the borrow situation. In my day, the best place to short stuff like this was actually the retail brokers, but NO hedge funds prime at these brokers and generally can't access these pools easily. A smart hedge fund has a little money at every broker he can, but it makes accounting and reconciliation a royal pain in the ass. Most hedge funds have 1-4 prime brokers. The very biggest have an account everywhere, but folks keep it centralized. Of course those prime brokers try to go around get 'borrow' for their clients, but typically they need to have someone custodial assets long (someone who owns gamestop) and then the rate is competitive. However, I'm pretty sure RH can give a locate/borrow to someone like Morgan Stanley (who incidentally bought eTrade). The borrow world is extremely opaque. IBKR sources borrows from lots of sources but they're a bit unique. It isn't uncommon from what I'm told for one desk to be paying a 50% fee to the client/lender and charging 75% to the borrower, capturing quite the spread. Back when I was short MNKD, the rate eclipsed 100%. Anyone know where it's at now?
  The next thing I'd say is the Melvin situation is unprecedented. SAC and Citadel have a lot of capital, but in the scheme of things, they're still hedge funds that aren't 10x or 100x bigger than Melvin. Well, there really aren't any hedge funds 10x bigger than Melvin, and the one that does exist (Bridgewater) doesn't get involved in individual stocks. The rest that are close are basically SAC, Citadel, etc, but they're only 2-5x bigger.
  The real question is, is Melvin out or not. My guess is they MUST have made the trade smaller given their losses. If I were Gabe I'd try to work the losses off, take a sort of ""one time charge"" (not really a thing in HFs) and move on. With discounted fees on new money he might survive, despite this being a big risk-management failure, it is quite the black/white swan. But I don't see Citadel/SAC investing knowing this trade is still on. That brings me to the next point.
  Yes, in the long run, I am bearish on GME. That means in 24 months the stock will almost certainly be lower than where it is today. That's what I do. I'm an investor. I've never been a great trader. That's probably because it's very hard to be a great trader. Even the best traders (think Cohen) are right around 55-60% of the time. You have to be nimble and accept losses quickly. Anything can happen here in the short run. Anything. The stock could go to 1,000. It'd be really stupid, but it could happen. I'm sure some of you are familiar with the ""max pain"" theory, that stocks tend to take the path that causes the most pain. That would be it.
  That doesn't mean I anything anyone should be buying GME. This is just the biggest poker game that ever has been played. It's really breathtaking. Longs know what their ultimate fate is, but it is sort of like Wily E Coyote. Whoever blinks first loses. In situations like this, I have found that BOTH sides typically lose. How? The shorts get blown up, obviously. After they get blown away, the greedy longs get blown up. The first-to-the-long guys are usually out pretty quickly (think 4 to 8, I'm done!) and the only ones who win. The first to the short guys typically stop out (idiots) or dig in (bigger idiots). If they dig in they almost never ride it out and get ""bought in"" or lose all their AUM through withdrawals or sometimes ""blow up"" (lose 100%+ of their capital). Blowing up means brokers take a loss, eg their prime broker. If I'm MS (Morgan Stanley) or someone like that, I'd be talking about my risk exposure to this trade lol. It reminds me of the old saying, ""lose $1 million, you have a big problem. lose $100 million, the bank has a big fucking problem."" At some point the chain of custody of the loss passes from LPs to the bank/brokerage. I'm sure some small hedge funds have already been wiped out.
  So, long story short (or short story long?), I still am firmly convinced GME is going nowhere from a fundamental standpoint. There will be no miracle Ryan turnaround that ever makes it worth $100+. But that doesn't mean the stock won't go up today, tomorrow, or even this whole quarter or half of the year or whole year. This is all a crazy Wall Street speculative frenzy and buying begets buying. I think there's a 30% chance it's all over and it goes down quite soon. A 30% chance it goes up, still quite a bit (30-50%) and blows off and then it's all over relatively soon. And then there's a 30% chance it doubles and then drops. And a 10% chance it could go up 10x before it is halted or there is some rule change or it eventually cracks.
  Whatever happens, you all made history. I'm kind of proud and kind of sick. Most importantly, I wish I was long! No position. Asked my people to look into shorting it over the weekend and told them today, yeaaah don't do that. I almost never trade as it's pretty difficult to invest from here and I think this one is probably too tricky to figure out without access to information (borrow movements, fund returns, etc.) If I had access to what all the borrow desks on the street are doing, friends at every fund who is a player in this debacle, returns from the funds themselves, one could kind of map out what is happening. Robin Hood level information would be the best, but clearly no one has that (except for Citadel lol). 
  Good luck to all, be careful (don't have more than half of your money in GME, don't use margin) and I hope you all make a fortune.

He asked me what I wanted and I didn't want to be greedy and said anything would be awesome and I'm stoked just at the thought of this happening and a burrito would be cool.

This GME brother bought me a steak with loaded mashed potatoes, mac and cheese and a cheesecake from outback steakhouse.

We all remember when he complained that shorting should be illegal, and when he released “short shorts” when he finally defeated them. 

But guess who used to brag about shorting Tesla? Gabe 🌈🐻 Plotkin. 

From [Bloomberg:](https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2019-07-19/cohen-cub-gabriel-plotkin-sees-fund-surge-about-44-this-year)

Plotkin described Melvin as “a very human-intensive place. We have a lot of analysts, we require a lot out of them.” The team has modeled more than 500 companies in “significant detail,” while a data science group reads into trends.
He added that the firm has an “intense focus” on the short side, with about 70% of profits in Melvin’s first year coming from bearish bets. Plotkin expressed skepticism about mall real estate investment trusts, as well as electric-car maker Tesla Inc.

$GME to the 🌚, then profits back to a safe store of value: $TSLA.

UPDATE: [better source](https://fintel.io/so/us/tsla/melvin-capital-management-lp) showing Melvin Capital’s puts on TSLA from 2016 through 2020

Honestly this felt like a demo webinar that also could've just been posted on their youtube channel for everyone to see.

The positive: it was great. I don't think I've learned anything new other than confirmations on how powerful their said features are and incredibly smooth their UX is.

The negative: their presentation obviously wasn't catered to stock market investors (felt more like a sales pitch). They didn't boast any new numbers or clients, which probably explains the after-hours price action. Also, their roadmap wasn't really demo'd. They just explained with words on what they plan on doing (again, if true, very cool but would've been compelling if they had clips supporting the roadmap as well).

My takeaway: just confirmation bias for long term holders that Palantir has great, premium products. Great insight on their tech but it was a hyped event that doesn't help the stock short term like tomorrow.

What are your thoughts?

Edit: rephrased ""investors"". meant to refer to individual stock investors, who often focus on info that could boost the stock's price action.

I just said this weekend that I was not going to take a position but you mother fuckers got me. The energy is inescapable, it’s intoxicating, therefore I’m in. Although it’s a small position (for now) I am fully committed. 

Now, I’m not saying that a dip will happen but it could. And if we are all in a euphoric state that dip will come in and crush many a spirit. BE PREPARED. If it does dip, that will be a pivotal point in winning the war and flying to the edge of the universe and beyond. They will come out fighting. It could be one of their last pushes before the real squeeze starts. But they’re injured. Don’t misjudge the injured opponent. Show the big bois the same mercy they would show if the table were flipped: none. 

I hope the dip doesn’t happen and we fly. But don’t be complacent. Be ready for the dip and press forward. I personally am holding till I have no fucking idea. $1k+? And I am fully prepared to buy the mother fucking dip. Rest up soldiers, the real battle begins tomorrow.

For more details, i will keep my sources at the end. (I'm really sorry about my english in this short DD, i'm from non-american country)

&#x200B;

**Great Expansion. /**

Since December, BB announced big surprises on the level of expansions of their company. 

7 December 2020 - We're talking about the co-development with **Amazon** of BlackBerry IVY,  a cloud-connected intelligent vehicle data platform.

25 January 2021 -  Partnership with **Baidu** of BlackBerry QNX, a software who's going to change the world of automobile. Used for a functional safety, a network security and reliability.  This announce about the creation of a good systems who can be implemted in every majors devices in long terms.

We're not talking about the OEM partners who are already with BlackBerry like **DELL** and **Infima**.

&#x200B;

**No Risk. /**

**192%** in **1 Month**, Looks alot if you see it this way. But is it really ?

Short Term - BlackBerry have an undervaluation for what it will come. The expansion of the company and the news who came since last year had a great impact. We think **192%** is a Pump and Dump, but the real answer is the road of 6$ to 19$ who is really small of what the company can really achieve. There is a large room to grow into in a short time if we think about the fact BB achieved **138$** in 2007. Why not 100$ ? They are still BlackBerry no ?

Medium Term - BlackBerry already announced 2 larges connections with giant companies in less than 2 months, they are ready for something or they need to make it big. That's where i want you to think, they will need to make the most connections in 2021 for installing their ''power'' in the market. Now we have BlackBerry who have a **100% success rate in safety and security certifications,** it will be a major change when it will be installed and known of every devices fabricants. And it will happen before 2022.

Long Term - The best one about me. We talk about BlackBerry, dealing additionnal co-operation with larges enterprise with the future already writed in their head. Their software and their utilisation worldwide will be not only huge, but attractive. The competition in this sector is old and not adjusted of what cyberattacks can come. BB already had the experiance of owning a large chunk of the market with Smartphones, do you really think it will be hard for them again ? Don't think 19 US$ is high if you think holding BlackBerry for years, it's a steal. literally.

&#x200B;

**BlackBerry Itself. /**

We're talking about the great expension BB has and about the international development of the software, but do you really know BlackBerry ?

Hacking, like this it looks not a big deal. But do you really know the impact it has ?

**12 May 2017** \- 80 Hospitals in England were affected by a Ransomware, writing patients on paper and pen

**July 2017** \- Equinax ,byberattack over **143 million American, Canadian and British customers** as well as **200,000 credit card numbers.** They had a simple vulnerability

**January 2021** \- Central Bank of New Zealand, security breach was found, 50 customers were affected. **20 YEARS OLD** software wasn't updated.

I could continue all night long about security software who are not updated or not enough fiable for today world. BlackBerry have, and will take, the advantage of making their presence in the market really soon, like we saw. What i really love about BlackBerry is that they don't stop innoving they product, they stopped working on their Smartphone for being full-time on what will come soon. They are extremely good in their domain and they will kill when coming in the market !

&#x200B;

BlackBerry re-invents itself, and you can join them.

In Resume : BB best thing to buy now

Every action one takes in a financial market potentially manipulates prices.  Thus references to ""manipulation"" in this context means specifically actions that violate SEC regulations.  Despite all the scare tactics and vague claims, I have yet to see anyone actually mention a specific potential violation.

Please school us.  Rocket rocket rocket, rainbow hedgehog, chicken tenders.  (Sorry, not from around here.)

[Edit: You guys really are retards and mostly missed my point.  Everyone is here defending the actions of WSB by saying ""what others do is 10x worse"" or ""they deserve it"" or ""they can't go after all of us"" or ""we like gamestop, that's all there is to it.""  It is legal to buy a stock *even if you don't buy it based on the fundamentals underlying company.*  You could think GME is trash and still buy just because the short interest is high.  That's not illegal.  It's not illegal to try and convince others to buy it for that reason.  Markets are complicated and they can't be ""morally"" regulated like this.  (That goes for all the retards suggesting that short selling should be banned too.)

When people say ""this isn't financial advice,"" that legal disclaimer is to note that they are not a ""financial advisor"" which is a very specific role, wherein the advisor has to act in the fiduciary interest of their client.  It is perfectly fine to give, receive, and act on financial advice and public information.  It would be illegal manipulation to knowingly lie about GameStop in order to induce others to purchase the stock.  Even then, *intent* is essential, and it's not simply a matter of being wrong or retarded.]"|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163932.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['SEC', 'I', 'WSB', 'GME']|['GME']

**Retail does not want to be manipulated anymore.**

For decades Wall Street was manipulating securities, getting away with it, and blaming it on others. Through the media, bullshit target prices, naked short selling, or other forms of manipulation mentioned [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_manipulation) (Kenneth, [this one](https://www.ft.com/content/16cee174-3b7f-11ea-b232-000f4477fbca)'s for you). Citadel and many other MMs - don't misinterpret with Market Makers, we're talking about Market Manipulators here - got away with their dirty tactics to make shitload of money and screw people over. They finally got caught in their own game and tried everything to turn it around, but Shitron didn't work, the media didn't work, more aggressive selling didn't work. Now they're calling through some random crooks for regulations.

**BULLSHIT.** Regulation for what? Exchange of ideas? Our own Due Diligence? Winning against you in your own game? Yeah, in most cases your buddies at the SEC would gladly do so if you tell them anyway. This time though? People finally came to the realisation what the fuck you guys are doing over there. It was known by many since 2008 but people forgot quickly, and now is the time to remind them that you are no one else's friend but your crooked buddies.

I never thought I'd say this, but this community showed more leadership and guidance than any other media network. Providing knowledge, research, answers, many of you proven that **you are better people** than these fuckers with billions of dollars of AUM. You should be proud of yourselves as you are leading an unprecedented event in the history of finance. **Unprecedented.** This is why you should still guide others and be an example. Of course, we are not an entity and we will never be - just remember that you are a part of something great, maybe something that will change the way financial world operates, in a smaller or larger way. Remember that there are sharks among us who got pissed at the dirty games as well (shoutout to you Elon & Chamath). We are not alone.

They blame us? Let's blame them. They will lose all credibility sooner than later, not to mention this incoming generation. The media is here now, you still might convince my 80-year old grandpa that the internet is something out of Pandora's Box, but soon enough you won't be able to convince a single person. We are an important source of information for many people, and I'm not talking about WSB, but about the people that make it. Let's go there in the world and spread the facts.

Hence, dear Market Manipulators:

***Do not mislead again. Do not manipulate again. Get your facts straight. Retail matters, and you will see it.*** "|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163910.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['$GME', 'LSHIT', 'SEC', 'I', 'AUM', 'WSB']|['GME']

CenturyLink (LUMN) Lumen Technologies has been selected to help Nebraska transition onto their next generation 911 emergency system. By using this next generation emergency system it will help improve the delivery of emergency calls by not only allowing residences to voice call but also allowing them to send text messages, videos and pictures to emergency responders.

# CenturyLink signed 5 year contract with Nebraska Public Service Commission

They signed a contract with the State of Nebraska Public Service Commission which establishes a statewide Emergency Services Internet Protocol Network (ESInet) that serves approximately 70 PSAPs, with the goal of having all seven PSAP regions connected to the ESInet by the end of 2022. The contract, which Lumen had won previously, has an initial term of five years with five one-year options

# NG911 Features

Lumen's enhancements to its NG911 platform will provide new customers with a portal featuring a customer management dashboard with access to:

* a real-time view of the health of customer NG911 systems;
* the call path from origination through delivery to the public safety answering point (PSAP);
* component level monitoring, status, inventory and diagnosis; and
* reporting metrics.

I am an actor and my wife is a social worker and covid hit us hard. There is no break in bills or rent and work is stagnant, To add to this a few months back both our cats got cancer at the same time, it has been a struggle managing vet visits and bills (we have spent at least 5k by now)

I have been lurking on this sub for a while and figuring out how it all works and what you guys have recently done is nothing short of amazing - leveling the field in this unjust world. This morning we bought a few shares of gamestop what we could afford, and you all helped pay for our cats one day cancer treatment. We didn’t have much to put in and only the belief in your movement made us take the small plunge. You have no idea how much this means to us . 

You are over here changing lives when there was no help or hope. You gave us hope . 
Please keep going - In our small way we are with you. Whatever we can put we are behind you. This brings back faith in humanity and what we can achieve together. Its been too long we have been push down with a knee on our neck and you are changing this. 
Our deepest thanks to all you retards( i see this is the common terminology here) but you are nothing short of amazing.

Thank you 🙏🏽

Edit/update:  I have been at a loss for words this morning after seeing all your messages , it has been really overwhelming. I wrote that message last night before bed because I just wanted to share what you guys did for us in one day by giving us hope that we can afford to continue treatments for both of them. 
I know “you just like the stonk” from the many comments, but it has meant a  lot more than that for us. From the bottom of our hearts I thank you for your well wishes and support.
 Just knowing that we are not alone gives the strength to push on forward. This has been a real example of humanity. We have not setup a gofund me for them because we didn’t  feel it was right to burden others, but from  some of your comments/advice I will do it today and if I am allowed I will post it here. The kitties are hanging in , they are brothers Mowgli and Charlie and are fighting for their health. I will expand on their story in the gofund me page.

When someone thinks a stock is going to go down or a company will go bankrupt, they can borrow shares from their broker to open a ""short"" position.  They then sell the shares immediately at the current market price.  They have a specified amount of time to return the borrowed shares to the brokerage.

If the stock does go down, the investor buys that number of shares at the now lower current market price, and then returns them to the broker.  He/she keeps the difference.

If the stock goes up, they have to ""cover"" their position.  They can ""buy-to-close"" whenever they want, but many of them will wait for a very long time because they are large firms who have a lot of money and leeway with their brokerage.  However, if a stock keeps going up and up, the brokerages can call the investor and demand the shares back to hedge *their* losses.  This forced buying drives the price up even more, which then causes other brokerages to make the same phone call to their clients, and so on and so forth.  This is called a ""short squeeze"".

\---

GameStop is a declining brick-and-mortar video game retailer.  Their management has not adapted to the digital world where many video games are downloaded instead of on discs.  They have been making some moves in the right direction, such as closing underperforming stores and paying down some debt, but they need to reinvent themselves to succeed.  Many large investors/firms have seen this coming and took out short positions a few years ago.  The stock kept going down so the brokerages and banks hadn't called yet. GME is the most-heavily shorted stock on the market.  More shares are shorted than are in circulation.  It's called ""naked short selling"", it's complicated, and some of it is probably illegal but the SEC looks away.

[Ryan Cohen](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890) founded Chewy.com when he was 25 and sold it six or so years later for $3.5 billion.  Last August, he purchased 9% of GME's shares.  When it was disclosed in the SEC filings, the stock went up 22% in a day (which is a LOT in normal circumstances).  The thought being that he was going to attempt to take over the company.  There was a lot of speculation online.  In late November he wrote a [strongly-worded letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf) to the Board of Directors.

Shortly before Christmas, he disclosed that he had bought more shares and now owns 12.9% of the company.  He bought the new shares at $16ish, after buying the first batch around $4.  When someone owns 10% or more of a company, there are heavy limitations on how much they can sell at one time, in a given period, and they have to disclose everything.

This signaled that he wasn't in it for a quick buck and he probably really was going to try to take over and modernize the entire company.  Gamestop has something like 55 million members in their club/newsletter thing, and that data can be used to make a lot of money through targeted advertising and such.   There have also been confirmed rumors that the company will be making a serious run at the fast-growing PC gaming market (many serious gamers build their own computers).  Video game competitions are also very popular and can be capitalized on.  The stock continued to slowly climb, with some sell-offs and such along the way.  It was not for the faint of heart.

Fast-forward to January 10th, when it was announced that Cohen and two of his board members from Chewy were officially appointed to the GameStop Board.  It was really looking like the theories from last fall were correct.  The news sent the stock soaring and the investors who had short positions were in big trouble.  Some of them started covering their debt, but many didn't and still haven't. The ones that did have incurred losses in the collective billions, and there are many more billions still out there that will be lost by short investors.

For the past two weeks, the pro-GameStop investors have shown great interest in the potential turnaround story of a store that plays a big role in their childhood memories.  With the presence of Cohen and his buddies from Chewy, an e-commerce giant, small investors can see that GameStop is now undervalued to those who believe in the new Board members.

The stock has been incredibly volatile as the large investment firms try to drive the price down.  One way they can do this by opening massive new short positions (AKA selling large chunks of shares all at once) as other shorts return their borrowed shares to the pool.  This can be seen many times along the daily charts of GME, in nearly vertical declines.  Knowing the potential of both Cohen and the short squeeze, small investors have been buying up all the dips.  If the shares are being held, and not sold, they are unavailable to be returned to brokerages. This drives the price up even MORE as the short investors scramble to buy whatever shares are available to fill their debt before the price continues to rise. Eventually someone is left holding the shares purchased at the highest possible price, but in this once-in-a-lifetime case, it probably won't be someone with a net worth under $100 million.

l5u45h|1132.0|MICHAEL BURRY – GAMESTOP ASPIE RETARD GENIUS – BURRY LONG $26 MILLION IN CVS OPTIONS!!! CVS TO THE MOON!!!!|t3_l5u45h|0.75|443|443|top|2021-01-27 05:26:20.000000|takerisksyoung|258|DD|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5u45h/michael_burry_gamestop_aspie_retard_genius_burry/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5u45h/michael_burry_gamestop_aspie_retard_genius_burry/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5u45h/michael_burry_gamestop_aspie_retard_genius_burry/|"  

As you all well know, Michael Burry is a retarded genius with dead eyes who basically prints money. After daddy Burry gave us GameStop when he initiated a very large position in early 2020, he also gave us another brilliant undercover idea in Q3 2020: CVS. 

Take a look at Scion Asset Managements 13F disclosure showing daddy Burry degenerately buying CVS Call Options. The fact Burry is holding shit tons of calls in addition to shares indicates a high level of conviction to me. 

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761920019679/xslForm13F\_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml

Similarly to Gamestop, CVS is a shitty looking chain of seedy feeling stores, where you go in to pick up your Chlamydia medication and leave sad. It is however undervalued!!!

So what does Burry know? The general outlook for healthcare spending is positive and on an accelerating curve, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating US healthcare spending reached nearly $3.5T in 2017, a dollar increase of 4.6% from 2016 levels. CMS is projecting healthcare spending to continue to grow at an even faster pace over the next decade, drive by expanding insurance coverage, an aging population, and increasing prescription drug costs. Specifically, CMS is expecting an annual growth per year of 5.5% between 2017 and 2026, with HC spending projected to reach 19.7% of GDP in 2026. 

The CVS acquisition of Aetna closed in November 2018, with the goal of creating an integrated healthcare platform to better position CVS from competitive threats. The concept is unproven and will take time to develop. From a cost perspective, management sees cost savings totaling at least $750m by 2020, with $350m coming in 2019. 

Let’s look at the money. Most of you morons prefer companies that lose money yet have fancypants PowerPoint presentations, so please avert your eyes looking at a cashflow positive balance sheet:

  Percentage of revenues:

| | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Pharmacy | 76.7% | 76.4% | 75.0% |
| Front store and other | 23.3% | 23.6% | 25.0% |
|| 100% | 100% | 100% |

2019 Earnings:

&#x200B;

| In millions (except stores) |2019 |2018|2017|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Total revenues | 256,776 | 194,579 | 184,786 |
| Operating income | 11,987 | 4,021 | 9,538 |
| Income (loss) from Ops | 6,631 | (596) | 6,631 |
| Net income (loss) to CVS |  6,634 | (594) | 6,622 |
| Number of Stores | 9,941 | 9,967 | 9,846 |

  

CVS basically does $6 billion in net income a year, and has a market cap of $97 billion, so it trades a Price/Ebitda of about 15 and an Enterprise Value/Ebitda of about 10 -- which in this market is FUCKING CHEAP. CVS is massively accelerating its rollout of minute clinics, and will continue to absorb all the fallout from private doctors and hospitals closing in the wake of Covid19. 

This is a list of over 500 rural hospitals that are facing closure due to Covid. CVS will absorb a lot of the demand for primary care that hospitals meet – remember most Americans are retarded and treat hospitals like primary care doctors.  
 [https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/state-by-state-breakdown-of-897-hospitals-at-risk-of-closing.html](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/state-by-state-breakdown-of-897-hospitals-at-risk-of-closing.html)

Additionally, the complete and total death of most retail stores, and the decimation of mom & pop stores, will only be a tailwind to CVS. This is sad but true. 

Lastly, the implied volatility on CVS options is CHEAP!! Basically, this is not a stock that generally makes sharp moves, nor does the market expect it to – meaning that you can buy options very very cheap. And IF the market or WSB figures out that daddy Burry wants us to buy this too – expect these options to EXPlODE!!!

NOK is not the next GME. NOK is not the next TSLA. NOK is NOK. I gave a conservative PT of $10 EOY and I still stand by it, not what you gaylords translated to $10 EOW or some shit. Keep in mind, that’s still over a 100% gain, so tendies are there.

Looking at my previous DD, here’s how you should REALISTICALLY, and qualitatively, value $NOK:

&#x200B;

>5G infrastructure giants… with little Chinese competition thanks to Daddy Trump (RIP) banning Huawei, Nokia is in an oligopoly when it comes to 5G infrastructure.

* It takes a long time to build infrastructure, infrastructure that won’t pay out until later

&#x200B;

>Which means…. they are the world’s 3rd largest telecoms equipment manufacturer

* 3rd largest, but still in a fiercely competitive landscape

&#x200B;

>Nokia does a lot of patent licensing, meaning steady cash flow

* Nothing to say on this point

&#x200B;

>Beyond telecommunications, they also work in imaging, sensing, Internet of Things, all the buzzwords

* These are all growing industries that show a lot of potential

&#x200B;

>Recently new management

* They will be doing some cost cutting and strategic positioning. Cost cutting is immediate but strategy takes a while to materialize.

&#x200B;

>Government contract are also a sticky biz, and this is the coolest of them all:  
>  
>\- Motherfuckers signed with NASA a $14M contract to install 4G on the moon. The company is going to the atmosphere, boys

* Let’s talk about gov’t contracts. NOK has a lot of them globally, they are usually paid out in installments They’re sticky business that provides consistency over the long term.

&#x200B;

To address other concerns that have come up since:

* “tHe fLoAt iS tOo BiG tO pUmP” Yeah no shit dude. WSB has such little influence to actually pump anything, plus if you want to dump it, it becomes illegal.
* **GME and BB Gang**, we are not trying to divide you. We are seeing opportunity elsewhere. Shut the fuck up and I’m rooting for you.
* **NOK Gang**, also shut the fuck up. Stop spamming and shit, actually present good arguments as to why NOK.
* Other DDs have been great and have done supplement research/brought up other points. Props to them.
* I jacked off before posting this and it was red. Mental note to see a doctor later.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Still a BULL but  you retards need to ground your expectation, now everyone hates NOK because it didn’t throw up two days of 15% returns in a row like you shills said. Very bullish on NOK, but it is a LONG TERM play. I’M NOT FUCKING SELLING. Suck my willy.

I'm simply sharing my own opinion and research. You are free to make up your opinion and decide to do whatever you want with your money.*

---------------------------

## **Status of GME 1/26. Why buying GME shares is a great idea.**

1. Elon Musk has been tweeting about GME. That brings **TSLA buyers** in, and a huge amount of wealth. What you saw in aftermarket was a glimpse of TSLA buyers.

2. **Wednesday will rally. Thursday will rally. Friday will be even crazier**. The $115 and $200 calls are very likely to expire ITM on Friday 1/29. Maybe even the newer 320 calls. This will trigger a gamma squeeze on Monday 2/1. Similar to the gamma squeeze of Monday 1/25!

3. **Shorts lost $5B today** 1/26 alone. Shares to borrow are rapidly tanking. Fees increasing. They are on their last rope. Older shorts are about to cover. Newer shorts probably just shit their pants. Melvin lost its $2.75B investment from yesterday (retards). Rumors of Melvin considering bankruptcy ahead of the short squeeze coming up -- they are about to lose their whole fund with the cover.


4. Again, the **gamma squeeze happening on Monday 2/1**. It's absolutely happening. Basically, this will force Market Makers to buy more shares of GME in order to cover for the 115$ and 200$ calls. More shares they buy, the less shares available to short. Meaning? SHORT SQUEEZE.

5. **Short squeeze is on the near horizon.** Could be this week/Friday. Next week. Or the week after. But the shorts are on their total last leg. Today was bloody for them.

So! Those 200c 2/19 calls look very yummy right about now. [320 calls](https://optionstrat.com/build/long-call/GME) are being released tomorrow as well. Just my opinion here.


## **tl;dr:**

## **1. BUY SHARES WITH CASH. TURN OFF SHARE BORROWING. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**
## **2. DIAMOND-HANDS ALL THE WAY 💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋**

For all you know, they reversed it and are riding the wave now.

&#x200B;

This ""math"" that $12 up on GME is $1b down to Melvin is complete, total, and utter bullshit. While it *could* be true, it's also just as probable it's not true. The amount you don't know about their books would probably astound you. They also can buy OTC options that you would *never* know about - meaning options that are entirely bespoke (over the counter), made just for them by their lovely PB and only they and their PB are aware they even exist. A bit unlikely, but not impossible.

&#x200B;

With that said, hope they get nuked tomorrow and learn a valuable lesson in managing your downside tail risk. Never short a stock without buying a way OTM call! If that pair has a bad risk/reward profile, move on.

They fear that their model, their traditionalist way of thinking, their place in society will become irrelevant. 

u/benaffleks summed it up beautifully: “This is a big moment. A tug of war between tradition and the future.”

Think about it. Why aren’t YOU a hedge fund manager? What makes Gabe Plotkin any more deserving to be a hedge fund manager than YOU?

He was born into the wealthy family, he was invited to the grown-up table in his early 20s, he placed a few massive bets, got mega lucky on one, made a few billion, and now he’s made to look like a genius. 

Yet, the thousands and millions of WSB retail investors have shown that investing doesn’t belong in the hands of a few. Instead of these mega companies and mega hedge funds, you have can millions of more efficient, more empowered smaller companies and investors who are deploying their capital (however small) in a manner that befits their worldview, not the worldview of a select few.

This is happening to just one stock. And look at its effect. We are upending traditionalist thinking. We are making front-page news. This GME bull run isn’t incredible for the gains over the past week as it is for how we are literally redefining how things currently work into how they should work in the future. 

The implications of this are mind blowing.

Education, climate change, healthcare, environment, personal finance, pensions.

These are the most important issues confronting us. But today, the decisions affecting these areas are made by a few elite. Can you imagine the kind of strides we could make in these sectors if we were to democratize decision-making? The kind of world we could live in? 

Chamath’s philosophy is to mobilize his capital to get us closer and closer to that. That’s why he’s dropping $10 mil on this experiment.

EDIT: The $10 million is referring to his Twitter reply, not the 115 February call options he bought! (Which was also poated on Twitter). He essentially said he would fund 100  WSBers with $100k EACH to go be a mini hedge fund managers with Chamath invested as a LP."|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163915.csv|StockTicker|['WSB']|[]|['A', 'YOU', 'YOU', 'WSB', 'GME', 'EACH', 'LP']|['A', 'GME']

I don't claim any knowledge. This is not investment advice. Do your own research, don't invest what you can't afford to lose, and if something feels wrong it probably is.* 

**TL;DR: This isn't about options (yet), it's about shares, and Institutional Investors are playing a dangerous game by convincing us (some of y'all have bought in without realizing it) that a magical short squeeze has some 3-day time limit, that Friday is somehow the end game, and are hoping that when investors don't see a $5,000 short squeeze by next week they will fold and take their gains at a ""reasonable"" double-digit stock price. Don't believe them. They can survive through mid-late February before the true short squeeze smashes upward. And I'll be ready.**



**THESIS:** If institutional investors can (1) convince retail investors to sell stock at reasonable prices and (2) convince their lenders to wait, then the 0.01% get richer.



**JUSTIFICATION:** There is so much public sentiment (passion, enthusiasm, excitement, anger, whatever) surrounding short (~1 day) price movements*, and Friday's expiring options (these are also end of month contracts), that it seems like big clever money may be trying to artificially create a sort of bear trap for shareholders. 

Whatever happens in the next week or so (crest to $700? crash to $60?) almost means nothing in the long term, but could fool investors into giving these guys CHEAP ways out of their 140% float short interest positions. Remember, these are people who have been dumping tons of money for a long time, shorting the stock when it was *in the single digits*. They've been hoping for a GameStop bankruptcy, and manufacturing one as best they can. 



**IT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME:** Remember the VW infinite squeeze, where we saw **weeks** of crazy price movement before the actual peak. And that is a mild case, as most of the shares were held by an entity with legal, competitive, and strategic reasons and obligations forcing them to hold shares and **artificially reducing the float, or available shares for trading**. This reduced supply caused the short squeeze. 

However, this time around we've got a huge short interest, much much larger by comparison than that from VW's 2008 peak, to the tune of **140% of shares available for trading (float)**. They've massively overreached, and are going to pay the price for that. **But they haven't yet.**



**SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S A CHANCE:** This time, however, if the big dogs can shake shareholders hard enough, weak links break and paper hands fold and a fantastic long term play starts to seem out of reach. The market manipulation wins. 



**DARE TO BELIEVE:** Unfortunately for the shorts, GME has [real long term prospects](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) to revolutionize the gaming industry for consumers, and now has the attention and potential equity momentum (if they play it smart, which I think the new leadership will) to make this a reality. 

From that link above:
>In GME's case the rise in the stock price itself will likely result in fundamental improvements to the underlying economic metrics of the company. 

I believe. 

However, if the shorts can fight, sneak, manipulate, and otherwise adjust the share price down this week then they start to see light at the end of the tunnel. They make 2-3 week plans for doing the same thing. For them, prices don't have to bottom back out, they just have to convince enough people to sell that they buy thrmselves a few weeks before a short squeeze really takes them all under. 

*Some of this price movement is shorts covering, but much is actual legitimate investment between retail investors and other institutional investors who have seen the light. Remember, TSLA didn't get to where it is because one company made some bad short positions. But if GME shorts can convince everyone that a 3-day squeeze is all they get until GME crashes to some ""normal"" level, then they win. 

Everyone getting hyped about Friday is playing into their hands. Yeah maybe some will need to take gains after a Friday pop, but a smart long-term hold position on GME is what they're really afraid of. And I want to be a shareholder in GME's future, as many wanted to be with TSLA. And sure, maybe if everyone else thinks that way too, there may be an incidental short squeeze that wrecks the uber wealthy in mid-late February along the way. 

**Again, I am not claiming to be knowledgeable or insightful, just commenting my best guesses. Nobody knows the future. This is not investing advice.**

I just have a knack for explaining things and lots of people have asked about this topic so I thought I’d share my own personal thoughts.**

# The bull thesis

To date, the GME play has been pretty simple: buy and hold and wait for the squeeze, whether that comes in hours, days, or weeks. Try not to have a heart attack during the intermittent gamma squeezes, keep your hands diamond strong during the manipulated downward spikes, and buy baby buy.

It’s rapidly becoming apparent that we will soon enter the GME endgame. Before you can come up with an exit strategy or, if you’re still on the fence, decide whether to jump in, you need to form an opinion about the GME bull thesis, *without considering the short squeeze*. Your thoughts on the bull thesis will dictate how you play it from here on out.

One braindead simple way to calculate a fair stock price for a company is to use a ""times-revenue"" valuation. You take the company's revenue ($6.466B in 2020) and multiply by some magic number (often 0.5 for low-growth companies and 2 for high-growth companies), then divide by the float (number of shares available to trade, 50.65M). A times-revenue multiplier of 0.5 gives a GME stock price of $64, while a multiplier of 2 gives $255.

This isn't a particularly sophisticated method but whatever, I'm not a particularly sophisticated investor.

Working backwards, if Melvin Capital thinks that GME is overpriced at $20 then a times-revenue valuation would suggest a multiplier of 0.16. That's extraordinarily low for a retail business. If you applied that multiplier to Best Buy ($43B revenue in 2020, 231.59M float) you would get a stock price of $30. Best Buy currently trades for $115, which works out to a much more reasonable multiplier of 0.62.

What multiplier is correct? Well, the bulls point out:

* Ryan Cohen (13% stake in GME, sits on the board) has a great e-commerce success story with Chewy, his previous company.
* Three new successful e-commerce board members from Cohen's firm were added to the board in 2020.
* Despite being a brick-and-mortar business and the pandemic, Gamestop's balance sheet isn't bad. They have approx. $550M in debt, but more than that in cash (net cash positive). They have minimal risk of default or bankruptcy in the near future, even without any change to company direction.
* Their traditional core business of game and console sales is not shrinking as fast as many people expected, with major new consoles still supporting optical discs and digital game downloads not accelerating as fast as feared, possibly due to stagnation in the ISP industry. So even if Cohen and his board seats take a long time to roll out new changes, the company is in little danger of any sudden spiral.

So is Melvin right and GME is a dead-end company with no growth potential and should be valued with a times-revenue multiplier vastly below its competitors? Or is it more appropriate to think of it as a brand new business, being spring-boarded off the healthy books of an existing brand by a successful e-commerce businessman alongside a revamped board?

How you judge that determines your exit strategy.

# Exit strategy 1: Just along for the ride

Maybe you don't care at all about GME's balance sheet or Cohen's planned turnaround, you bought a couple shares on a whim to be part of a unique movement. You don't intend to be a long-term Gamestop shareholder nor do you really care if you miss out on the highest peaks, so long as you make a few dollars and get to say you were part of the squeeze.

If I were this person, what would I do? I'd pick a number between 0 and 3 that I feel represents my confidence in the retail market's current expectation for Cohen and GME, and multiply it by 128. I'd submit a limit sell order for all my shares at that share price.

# Exit strategy 2: Pants-shitting fear

You've got a handful of shares and maybe some options and you're up big. You don't know much about squeezes or fundamentals or greeks and every time there's a dip and the stock gets halted you shit your pants and your finger hovers over the sell button. But then the price jumps up and you wipe the drenching sweat off your face and promise to hold firm next time.

If I were this person, what would I do? I'd sell all my options that expire sooner than 30 days at market open to reduce the number of pairs of pants I'm going through. I'd keep all my shares and longer-dated options until the news comes out that the shorts are being liquidated. And I'm not watching hedge fund managers get on Fox Business or CNBC or whatever, I'm following WSB and Twitter for rapid fire updates about short volume. If the short volume as reported by WSB posters drops below, say, 50% I'm selling everything and getting out. I might also pick a maximum times-revenue multiplier (something pretty high, like 4 or 5) and use that for a limit sell for shares.

# Exit strategy 3: Diamond hands

You've got bigger balls than most, and this isn't your first time dumping a significant fraction of your net worth into a company whose financials you've never looked at. You want to ride it to the peak, if at all possible, and you want to impress the pants shitters and the weak-kneed with your maximum gains. You are ok with increasing your cost basis to squeeze out extra tendies on the way to the top.

If I were this person, what would I do? I'd sell my weeklies on open tomorrow and immediately plow every dollar of those 20-bagger returns into shares. If my longer-dated options were purchased at extreme IV I'd do the same for them, otherwise I'd let them ride. I wouldn't sell a single share until the final squeeze, when news comes out that Melvin is done, and then I'd unload (in my pants). See you on the moon, brother.

# Exit strategy 4: u/DeepFuckingValue

IF HE'S STILL IN I'M STILL IN

# FAQ 1: Is it too late to get in?

The best way to judge this is by looking at the exit strategies. Which person are you? If you're (1) then sure, buy a share or two to be part of a once-in-a-decade event, but think of it as a fun expense - a ticket to ride the squeeze train - not an investment. If you're (2) then hell yeah buy those shares baby but avoid options unless there's a dip. If you're (3) or (4) then you're already in and lying to your wife about how deep.

# FAQ 2: Was that the squeeze?! Is it over?

This must get posted every time there's a gamma squeeze. It's midmorning and price suddenly launches into the stratosphere, trading halts, and it crashes back down. No, that wasn't *the* squeeze. Gamma squeezes occur when options prices are rising (due to sudden increased options buying or volatility) faster than market makers can hedge. They're good to get your heart racing but a short squeeze is slower and more stable.

# FAQ 3: How high will it go during the squeeze?

Who knows. $500? $1000? $2000? There's really no way to know. If you have the stones to get those max tendies then you should focus on listening to the emerging news about Melvin Capital and Citadel rather than watching the price. Sell when they're covering and not a moment before. That will be the peak.

# FAQ 4: How long will this take?

Could be tomorrow morning, could be tomorrow afternoon, could be next week. At the rate that shorts are losing money it won't be much longer than that. If you're not in yet, this is the final boarding call.

# FAQ 5: Who will buy our shares at the peak?

The idea behind selling at the peak isn't to sell your shares to another retail trader, but to sell your shares to the desperate short sellers who are forced by their prime brokers to liquidate their positions at any cost. That's the difference between a perfectly legal and time-honored short squeeze and a pump-and-dump. This isn't about irrationally driving the price upwards with the hopes of selling to a bigger idiot, it's about buying and holding and waiting for the shorts to crack and beg us to sell to them.

# FAQ 6: What is the next stock?

Get this thought out of your head. Yeah you just joined WSB and made a few bucks and now you think you found yourself an investment club. **No**. This is a forum for folks to share their risky trade ideas, not a place to coordinate to manipulate the market. Yes, at the moment the consensus is that we can make a boatload of money off of dumbass hedge funds, but think of it less like a pack of draft horses following a path and more like a room of angry, shitting monkeys who happen, for the time being, to be throwing their shit in the same direction.

# FAQ 7: Am I gay?

Many of us grow up to assume that we’re straight only to find out, later, that we’re not. Sometimes, we realize this because we have sex dreams, sexual thoughts, or feelings of intense attraction toward people of the same gender as us. However, none of those things — sex dreams, sexual thoughts, or even feelings of intense attraction — necessarily “prove” your orientation. There are a few different forms of attraction. When it comes to orientation, we usually refer to romantic attraction (who you have strong romantic feelings for and desire a romantic relationship with) and sexual attraction (who you want to engage in sexual activity with). Sometimes we’re romantically and sexually attracted to the same groups of people. Sometimes we’re not. For example, it’s possible to be romantically attracted to men but sexually attracted to men, women, and nonbinary people. This sort of situation is called “mixed orientation” or “cross orientation” — and it’s totally OK. Bear this in mind as you consider your sexual and romantic feelings."|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163910.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'B', 'A', 'GME', 'GME', 'B', 'M', 'GME', 'M', 'ISP', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'CNBC', 'WSB', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'IV', 'I', 'IF', 'S', 'STILL', 'IN', 'M', 'STILL', 'IN', 'FAQ', 'FAQ', 'FAQ', 'FAQ', 'FAQ', 'FAQ', 'WSB', 'FAQ', 'I', 'OK']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'B', 'A', 'GME', 'GME', 'B', 'M', 'GME', 'M', 'ISP', 'GME', 'GME', 'S', 'M']

The little kids that have been bullied by the big boys are finally saying enough is enough. But that is not what this post is about. 

This post is an appreciation and a thank you for saving a part of my childhood. I remember when I was only a little autist of young age, my excitement to visit the mall had always been to rush towards the little Gamestop they had next to the foot locker and nike store over at the end of Hall B. Id drag my mom over and what I was entering wasnt a store full of fat hairy nerds in sweatpants but a fantasy land full of bright colors, every game imaginable for sale, gaming magazines with demo discs, console stations to play for hours on, anything that a simple autistic boy like me would be into. While Im older now and rarely get the same hype as I did back then, I still visit a Gamestop once in awhile and enjoy the nostalgia. I know many kids continue to experience the same thrill of entering a Gamestop with their parents (which are probably you guys now) today as I did back at a young age. I’m in tears knowing that we are saving an important part of our childhood and allowing the potential for Gamestop to evolve into a 21st century Cultural Spot where everyone that enjoys games and collecting can gather. 

These Hedgefunds that bully the weak and manipulate the markets to profit off of making companies go bankrupt and job losses should be ashamed of themselves. They are attempting to destroy a piece of history in our childhoods and those in the making, we are saving it. Stay strong 💎💎🚀🚀💪🏻💪🏻.

Apparently, Citadel knows best and they can just manufacture shares. But not to worry, because these large banks will just get a bailout on tax payer money just like they did when they were selling credit default swaps and fraudulently manipulating the housing market. So while now it's $5B, it could very well be $10B next week or even $20B because they just have free money from the Fed.

Highlights of DD:

* With at least 71.2M shares shorted as of Dec. 31 and now likely at least 78M (a 10% increase), this means that deep pockets are ready to play and play big (e.g. willing to go up to -$20B).
* With only -$5b in losses, it would require another 500% increase from what it is today to push the shorts out, that's $1,000. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
* With so much equity growth, it has enough capital to do eliminate debt entirely, reinvest in a newer and better business model, and prove that they can actually earn this money back plus some allowing it's fundamentals to increase to the value it's been raised to. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
* I would be utterly shocked if it did not split at $400 back down to $50 to allow more ramp up. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Here's a graphic summary (couldn't embed in post):

&#x200B;

**Clarify - What is a Stock Split**: Stock split doesn't mean that you lose value. If the stock splits at $400 at an 8:1 ratio, that means for every 1 share you have, you will now have 8 shares. So if you buy 50 shares tomorrow at $200 for a total of $10k and the stock rises to $400, you still have 50 shares with a value of $20k. But then it splits at 8:1, you will have 400 shares (50\*8) and the price will be adjusted to $50 still keeping the same value of $20k. The shares shorted will increase as well so the shorts will have the same outstanding obligation and will have to buy back the same amount in $$$ to cover their position. Options holdings are adjusted and strike prices adjust so you control the same amount of $$$ too. This just makes it easier for more retail investors to get in adding more 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.

### Shorting

**How It Works**

Most traditional (i.e. boomer) investors usually try to make money by going long - i.e. “buy low and sell high”; this is when you buy a stock thinking it will go up in the future (bullish). Shorting is the opposite of this, you “sell high and buy low”, thinking the stock will go down in the future (bearish). This is usually done through the broker, where the prospective short seller would “borrow” the shares from them, and they would need to pay back these shares in some future date by “covering their shorts” - or buying back the exact same quantity of shares they owe the broker.

For example, imagine that there were only 10 Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards in the world. Because nobody wants to deal with taking physical possession of these cards and risk losing their Pokemon card in their laundry or something, everyone pays a Pokemon card dealer a small fee to store it for them. Through their dealer, you can buy and sell these Pokemon cards as well. A 🌈🐻 realizes that maybe Pokemon cards are dumb and borrows 2 Surprised Pikachu cards (who has a prearranged agreement with some institutional Pokemon card hoarder to loan them out for interest) and sell them for $420 each, thinking that they're actually work $100 at most, and plans to buy the Pokemon cards back at that price to repay his Pokemon card loan (i.e. covering their shorts) - this is a short sale. Since no one actually wants to physically hold these Pokemon cards, these cards physically stay with the dealer who could then lend out these exact same Pokemon card if the buyer also has an agreement to allow them to do so. This means that you can actually have people owing more than the total number of Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards in existence (i.e. short interest > 100%).

Replace “Surprised Pikachu Pokemon card” with stocks and “Pokemon card dealer” with “broker” and you have a short sale of shares. Interestingly enough, this also applies 80% to how banks work as well.

**Short Squeezes**

So when does a short seller need to cover their shorts? Well, either when a) The short seller wants to, either to take profit or to stop a loss, b) Their broker forces them to through a margin call, or c) The broker forces them to as the broker has recalled their loan, usually for a hard to borrow stock - they get “bought in”. Today, we’ll focus on C) because this is how short squeezes happen.

So, what does a broker recalling their loan mean? Well, to go back to the Pokemon card example, imagine that the dealer only has 6 Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards that he’s legally allowed to loan out. Some more 🌈🐻 short sells all the 6 remaining Pokemon cards until the dealer has no more available on hand. So what happens when someone wants to buy a Surprised Pikachu Pokemon Card and doesn’t want the dealer to lend out their cards? He’ll have to force one of those 🌈🐻 to buy back the card that they owe them so the dealer can give it to the prospective buyer. But who can the 🌈🐻 buy back the card from? The dealer. But the dealer doesn’t have any cards to sell, so they need to force another 🌈🐻 to cover so that the former 🌈🐻 can cover their shorts. This vicious cycle repeats and leads towards a sudden surge in demand for Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards and a spike in prices for it - a short squeeze.

**The Institutional Factor**

One thing alluded above was that shares can only be borrowed from \*some\* share holders, but not all. So who exactly can and does a broker typically borrow these shares from? These are usually margin accounts of either institutional and sometimes (although much less frequently) retail investors. Usually, when an entity signs a margin agreement, which allows them to borrow either cash or shares from the broker, they give permission to the broker to also lend out their shares in the process, and thereby also give up their voting rights - in case you’ve ever wondered who actually the share \*actually\* belonged to in shareholders meetings. Since almost every institution except Warren Buffet uses margin to a certain extent, and not that many retail investors do, especially given that retirement accounts are forbidden to use margin, and it’s much easier to “find” one big source of TSLA shares from one big institution with a margin account rather than find thousands of smaller margin retail accounts who hold TSLA shares, so most of the time, these shares are being borrowed from an institution (i.e. pension fund, hedge fund). This means that shares that are almost disproportionately held by retail investors are much harder to short because they’re harder to borrow from the broker, and retail-heavy stocks like HTZ, GME, NIO, and NKLA, which virtually no institutions actually hold, will demand high interest rates when shorting and the sellers can much more easily be forced to cover during a short squeeze.

### Stock Options

**What are Stock Options**

A stock option is a contract between the writer and whoever holds it that gives the option holder the right to buy (call option) or sell (put option) 100 shares of the underlying stock on or before the expiry date at a specified strike price. So for example, buying a GME 1/29 $1000c gives whoever the holder of this contract is the option to buy from the writer of this contract 100 shares of GME at $1000 / share on or before 1/29. Obviously if GME is lower than $1000 before that date, the holder would be an idiot to exercise this option to buy GME shares for more than their current market value, so they expire worthless.

This effectively provides the option holder an immense amount of leverage, and provides the opportunity for them to 10x or even 100x their original investment if the underlying asset moves the right way - for example because a subreddit declares war on a hedge fund and pumps up a stock to make them go bankrupt, while limiting their losses to the cost of the option. The option writer will in return receive a premium for the option, potentially risking an infinite amount of money, but with a high likelihood of making a small profit. These writers would either be

1. Theta gang - who are looking to generate a tidy income source from those option premiums and pray that the stock doesn’t move in the wrong direction too much
2. A market maker - who writes the contract when they see an arbitrage opportunity between the market value of an option and the theoretical value of it, and hedging their contract they wrote by buying / shorting the underlying assets so they effectively don’t actually take a position in the market.

We’ll go over how 2) works and how this mechanism can be used as a financial nuclear bomb, but first you need to learn some greek. 

**The Greeks**

The greeks in finance is a set of factors that can affect the price of a stock option / group of options

Delta - Change of the option price as the stock price changes

Gamma - Change in Delta as the stock price changes

Vega - Change in the option price as volatility of the stock changes

Theta - The decay in the option price as the expiration date gets nearer

Rho - Change of the option price as the interest rate changes; Most people ignore this

Looking at the greeks of the gambling tickets you buy is very useful to analyzing the ways you can make or lose money on them. Think TSLA will go up a modest amount? Buy a high-Delta call. Think GME is going to 🚀🚀🚀 1000% more? Look for a high Gamma call so your Delta gains accelerate as GME 🚀🌕. Do you feel like a vampire and want to have a steady income source from degenerate r/wallstreetbet gamblers on a stock you think will go flat (relative to historical volatility) over the next few months? Join theta gang and sell a high-Theta and high-Vega option!

**Market Makers**

The Black-Scholes model is a fancy mathematical model that describes a “perfect price” (a lot of caveats here) for a stock option. This is done by showing how every option written can theoretically be perfectly hedged by a series of purchases or short sells on the underlying stock. This means that theoretically, if there is a large gap between the theoretical price from Black Scholes and the actual price for an option, there is an “arbitrage” opportunity - this is where market makers come in.

Market makers are companies that provide liquidity to a market by offering to be counterparty to trades. This is especially useful in stock options, where a single ticker can have thousands of options, and there might be someone who wants to buy a GME 1/29 $1000c but no one is actually actively selling it. However, this option might be listed anyways and Citadel will sell you the call if anyone tries to buy it and then immediately hedge it. In fact, when you buy an option chances are you’re not actually buying it from its previous owner selling an option they already own, but from a market maker like Citadel (who is responsible for over 99% of all options volume in 3000 stocks).

So what happens when someone buys an option from a market maker? Since the market maker typically can’t (and probably don’t want to) take a position, meaning taking a directional bet if a stock goes up or down, they’ll immediately hedge the option they just conjured out of thin air by buying or shorting the equivalent number of shares such that the Delta of those shares is the same as the Delta of the option they wrote to remain Delta-neutral, so if the stock goes up or down their position value doesn’t change - this is called **Delta hedging**. Furthermore, as the stock price moves up (calls) or down (puts), they’ll need to buy or sell even more of those shares to remain Delta neutral since the Delta will change due to the option’s Gamma - this is called **Gamma hedging**.

### Putting It All Together - How options can be used as weapons of mass destruction against short sellers

Now we have the tools to understand how these two financial concepts put together can make billion-dollar hedge funds go bankrupt. Through Delta and Gamma hedging of market makers, buyers can have the effect of buying shares dozens of times the value they actually spent buying their option; a XYZ 4/20 690c can cost only $100 in premiums but causes the market maker to buy $2000 in the underlying stock to hedge against it. If you get enough retail investors to do this, they'll have the impact of billion-dollar whales on the market despite their small stimulus-check-funded portfolios.

Now, you do this on a stock that is heavily shorted, and with very little institutions actually holding real shares of these - making it harder for brokers to find shares to borrow, and you have yourself a weapon of mass financial destruction capable of making billions of Melvin’s money disappear in a single day and potentially have GME 🚀🚀🚀 to a trillion dollar market cap.

**How** r/wallstreetbets **Controls the Stock Market**

The one thing that’s interesting about all of this is r/wallstreebet’s unique position in being able to facilitate this weapon of mass financial destruction because

1. Most rich people or institutions too risk adverse to buy large amounts of out of the money options (unless you're Chamath or Elon)
2. This can only really happen on stocks that very few institutions (i.e. rich people) actually own, meaning it needs to be held / bought on mass by retail investors
3. In any other scenario where 1 and 2 happen to be true, this would be classified as market manipulation and be immediately shut down by the SEC

**My Positions**

r/wallstreetbets veterans may recognize me as the 🌈🐻 who wrote those long-ass 2000 word essays about how the [stock market is in a bubble](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) and loaded up on VIX calls last time you heard from me. Although I still stand by my thesis and stocks like GME, TSLA, and NKLA is just proof that we've reached the euphoria phase of it, I learned my lesson that I'm idiot trying to short it (for exactly the reasons described above) and got the fuck out of my position when VIX shot up back in Sept. Most of my ""real money"" has since been moved to gold and crypto, but because I'm a degenerate gambler, I still have a bit of money playing with /ES and a **calls on** [highly-shorted stocks](https://www.highshortinterest.com/) **with meme-stock potential** (i.e. vast majority held by retail investors).

[Blackrock increases positions in GME](https://sec.report/Document/0000834237-21-001340/)

Here's some observations for us autists on this. This is not as *bullish* as it seems. Why?

When Passive funds get into a stock - there's evidence that they *usually* allow a significant portion of their position to be borrowed against (see below). By doing this, they extract returns from capital appreciation & interest from the Shorts. **For GME longs, this is bad in the sense that there is an increased amount of shares available to short.** 

In my opinion, a big passive fund like Blackrock could care less about returns on 1 singular stock, so this brings up the question. **Why did Blackrock increase their positions?** 

Probably will get an answer like 'market cap increase led to increased size of tracked index, so we got in'. But this is some cookie cutter shit. What if they're working with the Shorts to increase borrowed supply? Funny how this happened in tandem with Melvin's capital infusion. 

If someone less retarded than me were able to connect the dots, this looks like *fraud-ey* to me. Someone with more vested into GME should definitely look into this. This type of activity looks like the beginning of a wider onslaught by the Shorts ahead of this Friday's options expiry

For less autistic retards - index funds allowing their shares to borrowed, is in a weird way how they 'sell' their voting rights. **This actually happened to GME in the recent board meeting & it looks like the Shorts were trying to prevent Ryan Cohen & Co. from taking too many of the Board seats**:

>We examine funds’ incentives through an empirical study of the lending-voting tradeoff after the Securities and Exchange Commission’s 2019 guidance on funds’ fiduciary duties. The guidance departed from prior practice by encouraging funds to take into account “opportunity costs” of share lending when making their voting decisions. In the past, SEC staff guidance required that funds recall shares they loaned when material items were on the ballot to ensure that voting would occur. ...  
>  
>More share lending means less voting – regardless of whether the shares are borrowed in the end. Because shares can be borrowed at-will from the lending agent or broker, and then voted by the ultimate holder as of the record date, shares put on loan do not carry voting instructions. Hence, shares made available for loan but not borrowed are not voted – making share lending a significant contributor to non-voting. By one estimate, in 2010 alone, 60 billion shares went unvoted, with 15 billion shares on loan.  
>  
>**With no fiduciary constraint on share lending, corporate elections can have surprising results. Most notably, in June of 2020, a proxy fight at GameStop surprised the investor and corporate community when activists with only 7.3 percent of shares won board seats despite opposition from large institutional investors that collectively owned around 40 percent of shares. This was possible because nearly 40 percent of GameStop shares (nearly all the shares held by institutions) were on loan, most of which were presumably borrowed by short sellers and other investors with goals contrary to the funds and similar long-term investors.**

Like  kinda obviously you wanna take $$ profits as hedge funds are covering  their shorts. But how would I even know if this happened?  Have any  hedge funds already done this / is that the reason for the postmarket rise?

Bonus question: Would it make sense for them to cash out during or after market?  
If you do it after, retail investors can't cash out, not sure how that affects the equation.  
I would think after, but I'm kinda retarded and don't really have a good opinion on that.

We need you guys and even if we do get spammed with some bullshit posts from 2 month old bots, I’m okay with that as long as you guys can keep this sub up and running.

THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. FUCK YOU.

The short interest on the stock is over 100%. That means Wall Street got greedy, borrowed and then reborrowed shares to expand their short positions with the hopes of cracking the stock.

Wall Street did not expect good news to come from GME, but it did. They decided to react with GREED and INCREASED their short positions to manipulate the markets and force the price down.

Now some simple supply and demand: The demand to borrow the stock is MUCH larger than the supply, so what can you - my fellow autistic tendy hungry cuckholding retard, do? If you buy shares (not call options, or CFDs) you will further restrict the supply of the shares that can be borrowed for greedy short positions.

Demand continues to be huge, therefore the price will sky rocket.

This is not speculation, this is economics. This is George Soros versus The Bank of England.

So say it with me, can't stop, won't stop, Game Stop.

I just wanted to post some information about Gamestop next to additional information.

Right now as of 09:36 CET, Gamestop ist up 109% in German trading. The price usually corresponds to future prices and aligns with US pre-market trading once available.

Interesting: short sellers of Varta AG, German battery manufacturer who was in the past heavily shorted, reduced their positions strongly. For example Melvin Capital reduced its position by 15%, Maplelane Capital reduced its position by around 16%. These are relative values. Current shorted stock is ca. 8% shares outstanding. Varta shares rose ca. 25% in the past 5 trading days.

This means that shorts fear similar situations as is the case with Gamestop for their other positions. Keep that in mind when hunting for other short squeezes. The shorts are cautious now.

Keep at it, but be careful

Edit 1: This is no intent to boost Varta. I would not do it personally, since as stated, shorts have retreated and numbers of shares shorted is nowhere near GME.

My position in GME: no position right now. I sold my shares after German market open and am waiting for US market open to look at initial trading.

Update 1: Now that US pre-market trading has opened, share price in Germany has aligned. This does not mean, there has to be a bad performance on NYSE today. The intent of looking at German prices early was also to see if Elon's tweet drew additional buyers, which could be argued."|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163917.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'CET', 'US', 'AG', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'US', 'US', 'NYSE']|['AG', 'GME']

It all starts with Melvin Capital. Who *had* around $13bn in assets. From them
reporting being down over 30% as of Fri 22-1 in the month *overall* we can
deduce that at the time they had a $3.7bn loss. The stock price on the day
before was $43.03.


When the price rallied to the $70s on Fri-21 they were shitting their pants b/c
they were now showing nearly a $6.5bn loss. They called up their buddies
Citadel and Point72 and got $5bn in loans, convinced their brokerage they could
get out of it (to not get liquidated) and started *trying* to illegally
manipulate the market. It didn't work; you retards and whales held. And kept
buying.


As of EOD 1-26 the stock price closed at $150, then to $240 after market. 

Melvin now has as a $13bn loss. This kills the Melvin.

These short positions are now parasitic fuck bombs that will literally
*consume* anyone who is holding it when the dust clears. 

Melvin's brokerages will be liquidating their assets ASAP less *they* get stuck
with them. But here's the fun part...  No one's selling b/c of you degenerates.
But, alas, there's a solution. There are funds like Blackrock who specialize in
[Security Lending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_lending) (see
[securities-lending-viewed-through-the-sustainability-lens.pdf](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/publication/securities-lending-viewed-through-the-sustainability-lens.pdf)).

> cover. a. short. position

.

Turns out, Blackguard owns 13.2% of GME — 11,271,702 shares. And they just
sold 2,054,367 shares to bail someone out for over $400mill. How do we know?
Because of [this SEC
document](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000083423721001340/us36467w1099_012621.txt)
filed *today* (also see [fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme/blackrock)). 

And what happened at EOD today? Price exploded to $240 for a moment as these
got bought. Lines up. This is the smoking gun to signal the action.

At conservative estimates there are at *least* 50,000,000 short positions yet to cover.
Blackrock is their last life line and will only hold out for so long. Once
Blackrock goes it's a fucking free for all. All the shorts who have yet to
cover are fucked. Completely fucked.

At $200, 50,000,000 shares is $10bn. But $10bn is literally GME's market cap.
To get rid of $10bn in GME shorts they'll be at least doubling the price/market
cap, so by the second that $10bn loss is going to be grow, and grow. Doubling,
tripling, quadrupling even.

This is their armageddon. That single $GME short position could completely wipe
them out. That position is a wildfire in their portfolio that can only be
extinguished with *money*.

$1,000? That's a fucking *joke*. They will be *scrambling* to cover, constantly out bidding each other on orders.

# **This could be hitting over $5,000 or more**

I am not fucking kidding. The higher we hold, the higher it goes until the last one
is standing with the -99.999999999999%.

And you wanna know the extra fucking wild thing?

Meta.

Every Brad, Chad, and Susan at BIG HEDGE X Inc that shorted GME are *awake*.

# **They are reading this**

They are scouring and scrutinizing every indicator, every sentiment, every
*post on WSB* they can to decide on what to do. When they see this post?

In 2008, VW had a short squeeze, when short sellers found out that only 6% of the float was available they scrambled to buy stock. VW soared to over €1000 per share. GME is 136% shorted, the squeeze will make history. It’s not about market manipulation, or hive mind thinking. It’s a chain reaction of events that will probably lead to regulation on shorts.

Edit: just to clear some common questions up. Yes the price can be anything we want. With 136% of stock shorted. That means more stock has to trade hands than there is available in a very very very small amount of time.

It’s not too late to get in as I say 136% of stock still HAS to trade hands at MARKET VALUE.


Edit#2: simple explanation of a short.

Firm owns GME stock (let’s say 100,000)

Hedge fund asks to borrow the stock to sell and agrees to pay interest the longer they borrow it. 

Hedge fund sells the 100,000 shares at market value (let’s say $10) and has that $1,000,000 suspended. 

If stock goes to $5 market value, they close their position by buying those 100,000 shares they borrowed at $5 ($500,000). The money for that is used by the $1,000,000 that was suspended, leaving $500,000 left. 

Hedge fund gives back the 100,000 shares to the owner and pockets the $500,000.

If the price were to go up though to say $15 then the hedge fund has their $1,000,000 suspension taken and they owe $500,000 on the difference.

This is why Melvin capital is facing bankruptcy, if it was true they bought shorts at $20. Then today opening at $244 dollars means they would have to pay $224 per share to close.


Edit#3:  you will know when the squeeze happens. Trust me you will know. The stock will rocket so high in a second. Trading will be suspended to allow people to set sell prices. Then rinse and repeat until all the shares owed are paid back. 

People who sold on the first spike are probably regretting it now. Diamond hands are going to make millions."|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163914.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['VW', 'VW', 'GME', 'I', 'HAS', 'ARKET', 'VALUE', 'GME']|['GME', 'HAS', 'GME']

So, while cleaning the cake out of my pants, I decided to watch an educational film on ""How to Stonk"" in a feeble attempt to add even the slightest wrinkle to my perfectly smooth brain. I immediately pass out after trying to walk and count at the same time.

I come to about halfway through the movie and there *HE* is - in all his omnipotent glory - [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/).

It really was so obvious and I'm ashamed it took me this long to figure it out, I mean, have you ever seen DFV and McConaughey in the same room???

Melvin Capital reduced GME to $4 and held it under their thumb for a YEAR. I thought they had unwound on Monday and I was wrong.  They have 5 fucking years of puts and shorts of this stock.

**As Jim Cramer asked on CNBC just this week: Why didn't they just take their profit?  What was their goal? Bankrupt them?** Well Jim, I think they could have pushed that at any point between July 2019 and July 2020. So why hold it down for a year at their expense?  Do they fucking shop these companies out for takeovers?

There was a post earlier today about the largest individual shareholder - Donald Foss - [a self made billionaire who created his fortune financing used cars sales to underqualified buyers with pre-installed kill switches to ensure they paid their loans with brutal interest or faced next day repos and overpriced lawsuits](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/04/car-subprime-bubble-auto-loans-credit-acceptance-don-foss/) - now owns roughly 5% of Gamestop and that he looked like a ""jovial"" old man and must be pleased that his 5% purchase of Gamestop now worth $750million Dollars.  Some commented how it must have been a genius play or ""maybe he saw the DFV reddit posts"" or maybe he's just the luckiest boomer who decided to get into the Gaming Retail Space for Retirement Homes.  

This bugged the shit out of me to the point I should have been in bed 5 hours ago. Why the fuck would a ""billionaire"" 75yr old invest $14 Million in Gamestop on February 28, 2020 as a global pandemic was already unfolding and the impending economic impacts were already clear for anyone looking ahead?

Donald Foss is still an insider, theres a pepe silvia trail.  In 2015, the CACC stock was heading down, quite frankly resembling a sustained short attack. It had just run into some legal trouble, so maybe it was a good target to short? Maybe one of the Scumbag-Asshole-Cohert Trading Firms was doing just that?

[On October 23, 2014, roughly a month after Melvin Capital is started by Gabe Plotkin, Donald Foss sells 430,967 shares of CACC trading at $125.54 for $54million.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000120919114064903/xslF345X03/doc4.xml) 
Gamestop was trading at $34.  

[On December 31 2014 Donald Foss reports using 320,000 shares valued at $44.8 Million as collateral for a loan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000088555015000021/fosssc13g20141231.htm)

In the 3rd quarter of 2015, Melvin Capital buys puts on GME. I don't have the value of puts in 2015, but in 2018 those puts were amounted to $17,395,000.   
[On December 31 2015 Donald Foss reports using 570,000 shares valued at $114Million as collateral for a loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000088555016000086/fosssc13g20151231.htm)

**In the 3rd Quarter of 2015, Gamestock shares crash 67% from $41 to $28** Most likely because of poor fundamentals.

In 2016 Donald Foss does not touch his shares of CACC. 2015/2016 was a year of hot water for CACC. Game Stop barely moves trading the whole year from $28 - $25  

[On December 31 2017 Donald Foss reports using 220,000 shares valued at $71.5 Million as collateral for a loan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000114420418008911/tv486077_sc13ga.htm)
Gamestop is now trading at $18

[On December 31 2018 Donald Foss reports using 220,000 shares valued at $82.5 Million as collateral for a loan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000114420419007123/tv513133_sc13ga.htm) 
Gamestop is now trading at $12

In 2019 Donald Foss does not touch his shares of CACC.

**In June 2019, u/DEEPFUCKINGVALUE opens $55,000 worth of 18 month Call options on GME**
**In August 2019, Dr Michael Burry reports a significant purchase of GME**

[On February 28, 2020, Donald Foss purchases 3,515,200 shares, a 5.3% ownership stake, of Gamestop for $14 Million](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/901185/000110465920030651/tv538831_sc13g.htm) **Pure speculation, but Donald Foss most likely purchases this stake as he is a BIG FAN OF THE STOCK, out of every other stock on the market, this is the only one he has significantly invested into in the past 5 years.**
[In 2020 Melvin Capital has puts amounted to $55,080,000.](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link). 
Gamestop is trading at $4.

[From March 2020 until July 2020 - Donald Foss begins liquidating 250,000 shares of his CACC to the tune of $95,207,250, in the most unprecedented manner from his holdings, all while CACC stock price is fluctuating all over the place due to Rona + Fed Kangaroo Markets. These payments were coming out every couple days in quantities of 6000 - 10000 shares.] (https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0000901185&type=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0&count=40) 

**Where is this fucking money going??? It would have been enough to buy another 24million shares *to try to* increase his total holding to 38 Million shares, or over 51% of the 69.75Million float**  

In August 2020, Gamestop hits $5. Data available to me and my will to keep typing is gone.  *Did Foss continue to liquidate CACC into August/Sept?*

Everyone on the fucking planet knows where Gamestop is now.

TODAY CACC MOVED *closely* IN LINE WITH GME ATTACKS.  CACC STOCK HAS NEVER BEEN DECLARED IN A  13F BY MELVIN CAPITAL.  CACC STOCK IS BEING USED AS A LOAN OR SOMETHING BY FOSS THOUGH.  MELVIN USED ALL HIS OTHER DECLARED STOCKS IN THE ATTACKS WITH HEAVY SELL VOLUMES PRECEDING PRICE BOMBS.

Why does this look like a hostile takeover play that took 5 fucking years and they fucked up?? Why wouldnt the guy that invested $14M thats now worth $750M talk to the media AT ALL? What the fuck does he want Gamestop for at 75 yrs old?! And it took 5 fucking years to execute?!

TL;DR Did Deepfuckingvalue prevent a 5year vulture capitalism play? WTF?  SEC Give me Award.

The short squeeze continues to crush short sellers while EVs & Hydrogen are on the move. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw all 3 major indexes finish the day down, with both the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/PspccJG) and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/rwB8b2z) losing .07% while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/qg7hSBb) dropped by .15% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/NYVtHtF) remained pretty flat in a build-up day for today as the stock market is going to be hit with numerous economic data and big earnings reports from [Apple](https://ibb.co/kqJ38mj) which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Boeing, Facebook, Tesla & many others.

We saw almost 60% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/7kH7Zjv) advancing with some companies dropping below the 50-day moving average as only 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/x6pRR2P) finished in the green, with Communications & Real Estate gaining more than 1% while Energy was the biggest laggard dropping more than 2% despite being the leader of the bunch in the early morning.

We also saw large-cap growth [companies](https://ibb.co/3svx5md) leading the way while the rest of the groups were lagging behind as you can also see in the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/S3ChnhR) from yesterday, with most of the small & mid-caps losing ground while the FAANG, Tesla, Microsoft and some other big companies were keeping the markets steady.

In terms of economic data, we saw the November housing price [index](https://ibb.co/dG3FNCJ) coming in as expected with a 11% increase y/y, which was also supported by the Shiller [Index](https://ibb.co/5ndWrBz) which indicated a 9.5% increase over last year, the biggest increase we have seen in this economic data in more than 6 years.

We also saw the January [consumer](https://ibb.co/vxdYwYy) confidence coming in better than expected at 89.3 with most of the increase coming from the expectations that consumers have of things getting better in the near future as the re-opening goes along.

Meanwhile the Richmond FED manufacturing [survey](https://ibb.co/F6PzgFL) came in at 14, lower than the 19 we saw last month as we saw a decrease in shipments, capacity utilization & volume of new orders.

In some other stock market news, we saw a lot of highly shorted stocks rise yet again🚀🚀🚀, with the forbidden one rose by more than 90% for the day and continuing with an additional 120% in after hours, while [Beyond Meat](https://ibb.co/rtQccJB) rose by 33% in early morning after announcing a partnership with [PepsiCo](https://ibb.co/wRL5s66) which is one of the biggest food companies in the world, as they will develop snack & beverage products that are plant-based.

We also saw the pot stocks rise again, with [Tilray](https://ibb.co/wpZGYPD) 🚀 leading the way after some national agencies from France tagged them to supply products for experiments in France. Tilray has been on a huge run since the Aphria merger news, and the company still has a lot of upside potential left especially if the Biden administration manages to push some sort of legislation, even if it isn’t a full-legalization in the US.

The same hopes of future help from the current administration were also seen in the EV & Hydrogen [sectors](https://ibb.co/3TwmFNC), with a lot of names like WorkHorse, Lordstown, Nikola & many others rising significantly yesterday

Some big companies also reported yesterday, as we saw General Electric [beating](https://ibb.co/0jpB660) most of the estimates in early morning and giving better than expected guidance on future free cash flow, which is a very big thing for a dividend paying company which has been struggling in the past years, while [JNJ](https://ibb.co/vQwJh52) also beat expectations and guided for even better revenues and earnings for next year as they are expecting vaccine results by next week, which could be huge for the hole stock market.

We also received a couple of big earnings reports in after hours, with [Starbucks](https://ibb.co/x3jzxHb) reporting pretty much as expected, but this high valuations for the stocks don’t really allow for OK quarters, everything needs to be exceptional for the most of the stocks to grow into these big valuations.

On the other hand, we saw [Microsoft](https://ibb.co/z8htnJC) crushing expectations, beating by almost $0.40 and a beat of more than $2.5B on revenues hitting over $40B in revenues for the first time due to the big demand in cloud revenues with Azure growing revenues by 50%, even better than the 48% in the last quarter. Microsoft also [guided](https://ibb.co/FYkGRSw) for upside in the next quarter, as this was a sleeping giant just like most of the big FAANG names which were underperformers for the better part of the end of 2020.

Meanwhile the other big tech name that reported was [AMD](https://ibb.co/fnB4Zvw), which also beat expectations due to big growth in all-areas of their business. I’ll be making a Due Diligence in AMD probably later today as I really want to see what growth they have ahead as they continue to battle with Intel

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/ZhwtrgB) are mixed, with the Nasdaq leading the way as we also await MBA mortgage applications in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/3yGpYRj), but mostly expect to see what the FED announces later in the day, as they end the two-day meeting and it is very likely Powell & The FED will keep the interest rates close to 0% and remain very dovish, probably continuing the monthly $120B assets purchase program for the foreseeable future.

We were discounted and disrespected without anyone actually reading our DD. Was it our fault institutional money shorted over 100% of the stock? Hell no. But we were there with baskets ready to catch all the falling tendies from the sky when the institutional thesis fell apart? Hell yes. Who wouldn't?

These are my take away lessons from recent events:

1. Place bets on what you can afford to lose. Know this number before doing anything.
2. Watching the ticker throughout the day has no value. If you know what you've bought, be confident in your DD.
3. Beware of your sources of information; recognize their biases.
4. Don't make decisions based on price gyrations.
5. If the psychological pressure of a position is too much, it is OK to sell. There are always new plays that will be there in the future. Greed will always be present and money will be made.
6. Money managers on tv and on websites aren't there to help you. They are pushing always pushing an agenda. These agendas can be benign or malignant. That is up to you to figure out.
7. The narrative can be more important than the truth. We learned this the hard way. We were painted with a broad brush, characterized unfairly and wholly blamed without any evidence. This is important to recognize especially if manipulators need a narrative out there to help their cause.

This is my list so far.

Like to hear some thoughts.

Positions: none to disclose.

Based on technical fundamentals and the hard lesson I’ve learned from WSB after at some point betting against GME and learning to be a bull. 

Reasons why to invest in AMC:

1) DON’T bet against 💎🤲🏻 ppl because you may have small wins but will suffer big losses like I did by betting against them. 

2)GME ppl may be upset at this but I believe AMC actually offers a service you can’t get anywhere else unless you’re willing to wait months or a year to watch the latest movies. 

3) PRECOVID ppl were still going to the movies and spending money at the theaters. PRECOVID guidelines destroyed the stock price

4)PRECOVID the stock normal price was about $30-35. I expect as the states open up and COVID becomes the next flu and actors start making new movies, people will flood back to the movie theaters after being away for so long. THUS, AMC will start making money and the stock price will KEEP GOING UP

5) Even with offerings and 🌈🐻, AMC is a established company and BANKRUPTCY BEING OFF THE TABLE, make this a  STRONG LONG HOLD 🚀🚀

6) I don’t believe this will have that many 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 as GME because it’s not shorted over 100% 

7) Based on technical fundamentals and the new WSB fundamentals people are learning, AMC current price is a bargains and will definitely 🚀🚀🚀🚀 and destroy the 🌈🐻 that are shorting from $5-30"|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_164001.csv|StockTicker|['AMC']|['AMC']|['$AMC', 'SAFE', 'LONG', '$GME', 'WSB', 'GME', 'T', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'AMC', 'COVID', 'COVID', 'COVID', 'I', 'COVID', 'THUS', 'AMC', 'KEEP', 'GOING', 'UP', 'AMC', 'UPTCY', 'BEING', 'OFF', 'THE', 'TABLE', 'TRONG', 'LONG', 'HOLD', 'I', 'GME', 'WSB', 'AMC']|['AMC', 'LONG', 'GME', 'GME', 'T', 'GME', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'LONG', 'GME', 'AMC']

And when you pay those fees, you’re entitled to a little information about what is in the portfolio. Boomer hedge fund managers love to brag about their short positions, they love acting all intellectual even though most of them suck at short picking. 

But now, no hedge fund manager is going to tell any investor anything. They will never trust their own investors enough to disclose a single short position.

People view $AMC the same way they view $GME - just another brick & mortar Mall company that is essentially being destroyed by $AMZN Prime, HBO Max, and Disney+. Fair enough, but I enjoy watching a new release in IMAX with a flatbread pizza in one hand, and a flavored Coke in my other. I think many others do to.

To address everyone who doesn't care about IMAX or going to theaters, $AMC has to simply do ONE VERY SIMPLE THING that will literally blow the minds of the un-imaginative analysts who are predicting doom.  All $AMC has to do is rename ""**AMC Theatres On Demand**"", the program they started in 2019, to **AMC+**.

AMC+ will be a studio-independant platform for movies, documentaries and TV shows. No monthly fee, but rather an revenue-sharing a la carte pricing system. Of course I'd love to see $AMC poach some talent from $NFLX or $DIS when they announce AMC+. One can dream!

TL;DR- $AMC can pivot hard by simply relaunching their existing ""AMC Theatres On Demand"" to AMC+.

AMC Theatres On Demand is mentioned on page 47 of [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000141157920000074/amc-20200930x10q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000141157920000074/amc-20200930x10q.htm)

I get that they have been at the center of this and we all want to stick it to them. However, it doesn’t matter if they did or not. All that matters is where the overall short interest is at. According to another user who found SI data on GameStop this morning. It’s still well over 100%.

This can go A LOT further if the cards fall the right way. There has never been anything like this. I’m certain there will be books written about this and more than likely some additional regulations around short interest as well. 

Stick to the data. Fuck what CNBC says and any other hedge fund. They’re scared. This is an opportunity of a life time and you should recognize it as such and capitalize on it to the best of your abilities. Because chances are we won’t see anything quite like this again.

I’m joking, mostly. We should dance, this is an amazing time to be where we are. Anyone on the long side of Gamestop is going to make at least life-easing money, if not life-changing money. 

In March when shit went crazy someone posted a thread with the same title when we were all gay bears shorting $SPY and anything else that was traded. People lost all their retirements, their emergency savings, everything, just regular Joe’s. Most people here promptly lost all those gains because their diamond hands were just too strong. 

This is different. This is a transfer of wealth not to Wall Street, but from it. This isn’t draining an average Joe’s retirement account, this is holding hedge funds accountable for their shitty practices, suppressing prices and market flow, handicapping companies, and preventing them from succeeding. This time, however, the math didn’t work out. Think about that, in a room full of 500 quants telling Melvin Capital what to short, they caused a cascading effect that is coining new millionaires right here. 

I have never been on the short side, but I have never liked it, shorting a company to me feels inherently evil, but profit is profit. Being long makes me feel a lot better though. GameStop is an American institution, where else can you go to get ripped off as much besides Subway? It teaches people about the depreciation of goods as soon as they leave the premises. And Melvin wanted to destroy that. 

When you are beating your chest in excitement, hooting, and hollering, remember someone is on the other side of this trade, if it is the hedge funds, fuck them, but if it is other autists or theta-gangers, that sucks, it does, because Options trading really is a zero-sum game. To make money, someone loses money, usually all of it. 

To those retail traders on the short side of this, I’ll pour one out for you, but fuck guys, what the fuck?

I am the $ALLY guy.

There is so much going on right now. The market is broken. And guess who broke it? WSB. Love it. But there is more to this sequence of events than meets the eye.

Yes, everyone is up big on $GME. Yes, 20 year old millionaires are being made overnight. Yes, the market has been shaken up and deep-pocket investors are scared. All of this is great, but there is something bigger going on here, whether you know it or not.

Since the inception of the NYSE: market makers, insiders, and institutions have used the market as a medium to siphon funds from retail investors.

All of us are retail investors; we are fighting an uphill battle. Market makers/insiders/institutions exploit news releases in order to manipulate retail sentiment. By doing so, the market makers are able to orchestrate the price moment of the market, and even individual stocks.

The market makers do this by operating what is known as the ""accumulation phase"" and the ""distribution phase"".

During the accumulation phase, market makers influence bearish sentiment. As the price of the market or an individual stock decreases, the market makers buy MASSIVE amounts of shares. Once the market makers accumulate a predetermined amount of shares, the market makers will then influence bullish sentiment. As the price of the market increases significantly, the market makers will set a price target. Once the price target is met, the market makers will begin the distribution phase. In the distribution phase, market makers offload nearly all of the shares they have accumulated. Guess who buys all these shares while bullish sentiment is strong? Retail investors. Once the market makers have sold a sufficient amount of the shares they accumulated, they will then influence bearish sentiment and prepare for the accumulation phase. Guess who incurs heavy losses while the deep-pockets make money? Retail investors.

This is BS. How is this justified? Because retail investors never did anything about it. We never stood up for ourselves. Whether you know it or not, that is exactly what we are doing r*ight now.* We are standing up and saying ""Fuck you"".

Sure, the market makers probably aren't concerned with $GME, but who fucking cares. What is happening right now is symbolic of the power that retail investors have. It's more than power, we are fucking sick of institutions, deep-pockets, and market makers exploiting retail investors for money! FUCK THAT.

It is time. Time to deviate from the norm. Time to shake up the market. Time to scare the shit out of some very powerful people. Most importantly, it is time to change the world.

WSB is not about pump-and-dump schemes. Sure, we all bought into $GME and it is up nearly 8000% on the year, but this is still *not* a pump-and-dump. My interpretation of justice is to receive what we are owed. Let me fucking tell you, **this is exactly what we are owed**.

So, why stop at $GME? We pissed a lot of people off, and the same people we pissed off are the people exploiting our ""naivety"" for money. We aren't naive at all, we just aren't billionaires! This movement should not and will not stop with $GME. It's time to stand for something, and we will *not* stop until our ambitions are realized. Let's say the SEC comes knocking. So fucking what. What admirable person has ever achieved anything without a tremendous force actively oppressing them? As foolish as this may sound, doing **exactly** what we are doing **right** **now** may be the most important thing we ever do in our lives.

There is no reason to stop. We must keep going, we must be heard. After $GME, we *have* to move on to something else. I, personally, would willingly accept any punitive measures taken against myself if it meant pissing off some powerful people and changing the world.

We must produce inordinate buying pressure on $GME until the media hype dies. Once that happens, we move on and do it again. Make the deep-pockets conform to us. Never again will we conform to them.

Wishing everyone in this sub the best. Whether this post is hated or loved, just know that we are making history here boys and girls. Time to sack up and own it. Consequences? Fuck em'.

Specifically the prisoner's dilemma.


The prisoners dilemma was a game crafted by John Nash (see A Beautiful Mind). The game goes like this:


Two prisoners who we will call Aaron and Bob are picked up and brought into separate interrogation rooms. They are told their friend is ratting them out. They know the cops don't have enough to get a good hearing without one or both of them confessing. The cops say that if they rat on the other guy they will get reduced sentences. The cops offer to take 2 years off the sentence of anyone that talks.


The prisoners do not know if the other guy is talking. This leads to 4 possibilities: both dont talk; Aaron talks and Bob doesnt; Bob talks and Aaron doesnt; or, they both talk.  If neither talks, the cops can only put them away for 5 years each since they dont have enough hard evidence for the crimes. If only one talks, the person that talks wont have enough evidence against him so he will get 5 years minus 2 for talking. The other person will get 10 years. If they both talk, they will both get 10 years minus 2 for talking. In chart form it looks like this:


/                   |  A Talks |  A doesnt |


| B talks.   |  8 , 8.       |  10 , 3


| B doesn't|  3 , 10.      |  5 , 5


The interesting part about the game is that no matter what your best option is always to talk. It always takes 2 years off your sentence. However, the cumulative best outcome (the lowest jail time) is for both parties to act against their self interest and not talk and to hope your opponent does the same.


This theory flew in the face of Adam Smiths notion of unrestrained self interest. It won Nash the Nobel prize and is the reason cartels like OPEC are successful.


What does this have to do with GME? Holders of GME are in the same boat. Their own self interest says they should sell now and get out with their winnings. If they dont sell and the other guys do, they are fucked. But if everyone holds the line and acts against their self interest, they can have the best result.

l653mj|698.0|Calling Melvin Capital's Bluff|t3_l653mj|0.97|115|115|hot|2021-01-27 17:02:12.000000|Master531|6|Discussion|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l653mj/calling_melvin_capitals_bluff/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l653mj/calling_melvin_capitals_bluff/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l653mj/calling_melvin_capitals_bluff/|"Disclaimer: I'm just a regular autist like the rest of you with 99% of my portfolio in GME.  

&#x200B;

Melvin Capital claims to have closed out its short position on Tuesday afternoon which most of you probably have already read. I'm not going to even link that article. DON'T BE FOOLED BY THEM. No hedge fund is going to come out and announce not only to their investors but the ENTIRE PUBLIC that they have been retarded with the money entrusted to them unless there was an incentive. Remember: these funds make money not only by outperforming benchmarks but also on management fees on the assets they manage, juicy 2% fees. Why on earth would they spook not only their current investors but potential investors as well? They would see massive withdrawals if that was the case. 

For proof:

[GME 2 day chart 01\/25 & 01\/26 \(Operating on Asia time so AM is PM\)](https://preview.redd.it/nf4h7y34qvd61.png?width=1398&format=png&auto=webp&s=917cfa8fe653dab622de0f3f4012a34031c8bb50)

(https://imgur.com/gallery/L9EO2CN)

Notice how the highest volume of shares clustered around 12noon to closing at 4pm? Melvin conveniently selected the time period with the highest volume to disguise the fact that they are still perma-bear short GME. For a fund with Melvin's position, we would at least have seen a hulk green dildo at least somewhere in the day's trading session where those shorts were covered. What did we see instead? A slow steady grind upwards even with 5m shares traded at the day's peak. The spike only occurred after-hours on significantly lower volume at 1.3m shares. 

Think about it, Melvin was short GME when it was at least below 30 and if all of that 1.3m volume was from them, that would've been a $39m initial position for a hedge fund with $13.5 billion in assets back in early Jan or 0.289% of the entire fund which is too small to consider as a trade for their size. Even at the covered value of \~$230, that would have amounted to just 2.2% of their entire portfolio. A 0.289% or even at best, 2.2% trade driving a significant portion of their [30% year to date losses?](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/steve-cohen-ken-griffin-invest-3-billion-gamestop-short-seller-2021-1-1030003305) I don't think so. Financial news outlets once again serving as a mouth piece for billion dollar hedge funds - see what they do, not what they say.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** Don't trust every piece of financial news you read or watch, do your research first. Bill Ackman cried out Armageddon is coming on national TV at the bottom of the 2020 crash and went long immediately afterwards. This is no different. The GME war is still on. DO NOT SELL. 💎 ✋

Guys, GME has shown what power this community has. I have been following this subreddit for years, and have made decent profits with you guys. Finally its time to pay back the community for those profits, great laughs and memes.

However, it is peanuts compared to GME in terms of the ratio of stocks shorted. Then why is it mooning?

# My hypothesis: 
## I think it is a combination of three things:
### 1. **hedge funds who are short on GME artificially propping it up to distract GME retailers** 
### 2. **shorts who have seen what happened to GME trying to buy up the shares before it happens to them** 
### 3. **the GME shockwave has caused a lot of hedge funds to unwind their positions in other assets** (similar to what Melvin capital did with Evotec https://www.reuters.com/article/melvin-fund-evotec-de-idUSL8N2K150T)

If my hypothesis is right, then everyone should hold their GME shares, and we may see a historic short squeeze.

Potentially a tactic to scare people into selling if they feel they won’t be able to access their account when the big squeeze comes.

In March of 2020, small biotech —Inovio Pharmaceuticals—announced that they designed THE COVID vaccine within 3 hours. Their CEO (Dr. Kim)—while on national TV and surrounded by big pharma execs—told Donald Trump that they had developed the vaccine in “Warp Speed”. Soon after, you have “Operation Warp Speed”

Since then, INO has been MERCILESSLY attacked by big pharma and cronies like Andrew Left/Citron (27th most shorted stock on Wall Street)—it has frankly been a nightmare and stolen a lot of money from retail investors, but also robbed the world of THE vaccine.

Brief background:

• INO is the ONLY company to EVER produce a successful coronavirus vaccine. INO-4700 for MERS which gained EUA in 2017 in South Korea. Because of their YEARS of developing this vaccine (when working on a coronavirus vaccine was boring), they are YEARS ahead in what was required to formulate a vaccine to combat COVID.

• INO-4800 is the SAFEST (HANDS DOWN) COVID vaccine with not even a single recorded instance of even moderate side effects, let alone the abundance of SEVERE side effects that ALL of the others produce!

• INO-4800 can be stored at room temp FOR A YEAR. Anyone familiar with the MAJOR issues occurring with the extreme cold temp requirements for Pfizer and Moderna?

• INO is the ONLY ONE to prove LONG TERM PROTECTION. This is done via CD8+ T cells. Compare the data across animal trials. INO proved over 17 weeks of protection (and counting) in their primate study. NONE of the other prominent COVID players produce CD8+ T cells at a measurable enough level to make any impact. Their antibody protection wanes within a few months. The long term protection elicited by INO-4800 is consistent with their other coronavirus vaccine which has proven protection for over 38 weeks now.

• MUTATIONS—INO specifically engineered their vaccine to be very broad in order to combat the mutations and effectively be a UNIVERSAL COVID VACCINE. The others are too narrow in scope and did not account for this. Due to INO’s YEARS of coronavirus development, they accounted precisely for this.

• CELLECTRA DEVICE—INO has a patented device to administer their vaccine which allows ALL of their vaccines to not only be supremely safe, but to extremely OPTIMIZE vaccine intake. They do this through electroporation which they’ve been working to perfect for DECADES. We have FINALLY reached the future they have worked towards. CELLECTRA will revolutionize the entire field of vaccines.

I could go on and on, but my point is that if there’s going to be a short squeeze; there would be NONE sweeter than to roast the shorts who are attacking the company creating the SOLUTION to COVID and MANY OTHER DISEASES. The SEC has stood idle, the FDA is complicit in doling out senseless delays/halts, the medical journal that published phase 1 data delayed it MONTH AFTER MONTH until Pfizer and Moderna came to market.

Guys, if there was ever a stock to galvanize behind to force a short squeeze, it’s for INO"|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163958.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['BIG', 'HARMA', 'HORTS', 'INO', 'THE', 'COVID', 'CEO', 'TV', 'INO', 'ESSLY', 'THE', 'INO', 'ONLY', 'EVER', 'MERS', 'EUA', 'YEARS', 'YEARS', 'COVID', 'AFEST', 'HANDS', 'COVID', 'EVERE', 'ALL', 'FOR', 'A', 'YEAR', 'MAJOR', 'INO', 'ONLY', 'ONE', 'LONG', 'TERM', 'CTION', 'T', 'INO', 'NONE', 'COVID', 'T', 'INO', 'ERSAL', 'COVID', 'CCINE', 'YEARS', 'ECTRA', 'INO', 'ALL', 'IMIZE', 'CADES', 'NALLY', 'ECTRA', 'I', 'NONE', 'UTION', 'COVID', 'MANY', 'OTHER', 'EASES', 'SEC', 'FDA', 'MONTH', 'AFTER', 'MONTH']|['BIG', 'INO', 'CEO', 'TV', 'INO', 'INO', 'EVER', 'ALL', 'FOR', 'A', 'INO', 'ONE', 'LONG', 'T', 'INO', 'T', 'INO', 'INO', 'ALL']

AMC is the largest movie theater chain in the country. The pandemic has hurt small business, movie theaters included. The pandemic has concentrated market share on the biggest players, meaning AMC now dominates more of the pie. 

Theaters aren't going away anytime soon. Nicholas Christakis predicted in Apollo's Arrow that we will see a Roaring 20s after the vaccine. The Roaring 20s will see theaters and movie industry boom just like it has historically. Media companies will release a floodgate of movies and demand will be sky high for a while. 

AMC is poised to capture most of that demand and growth, especially given its recent investments into upgrading theaters. Imagine the hype coming from higher demand, tons of stimulus money, and backed up releases. 

300 shares $AMC @ 5.10

TLDR

The largest theater chain in the country will gobble up the remains of the weaker business that couldn't survive the pandemic. AMC will gain a greater share of the pie for greater long term growth. Roaring 20s will see business boom. AMC to the moon. 

And buy the dip! Going right back to $23.

If you look at the actual clip from MSNBC about Melvin’s position ( https://twitter.com/cnbc/status/1354406938319216640?s=21 ) they didn’t actually say they covered their position. They just said they didn’t *own* it anymore. This is very carefully worded and my theory is that they just sold it to someone with deeper pockets at a massive premium. Then they come around with the news that they’ve sold their positions, all in an attempt to drive prices down. It’s technically not a lie, but since they know that people will only read the headline it can still be used to drive the price down. This was probably the deal with whoever bought the shorts.

Why? I think the borrow rate is the key. I am told the locate is actually quite easy: eg, a hedge fund can short 1m shares if it wanted to. At the moment, that's a $300m position, which is quite large for even the biggest hedge funds. The borrow rate is 50%. What does that mean? Short sellers have to pay longs 50% interest (annual, simple) to borrow the stock. GME can get cut in half and you can break even, IF that rate persists. It may not persist. It may grow higher. I'd watch the borrow rate as the #1 indicator for the stock. If the borrow rate goes down, the stock is probably in trouble as your incremental buyer may not be there. If it climbs to 100%+, it indicates significant pressure (and expense) on the shorts. I think the stock is less shorted than people here might think and most of the price action is being dictated by speculative long buying. Short interest data is often misleading. A broker dealer is allowed to have shorts that are hedged against calls without necessarily getting a locate. The mechanics of this stuff are very arcane and it's not clear that it is policed at all. Of course, speculators need to have a locate before shorting. I can't repeat enough: watch the borrow rate, it's all that matters. Ignore the short interest numbers.

&#x200B;

SWOT is a silly analytical perspective for a trade, but let's try it.

&#x200B;

  Strengths

\#1. YOU GET PAID TO OWN THE STOCK. At a 50% borrow rate, GME is a bond paying you 50%. That rate won't last forever. In fact, it might go up! But I doubt it persists for a year.

Momentum

Pain Trade. At 1,000 the market cap is $70B. That's pretty stupid, but it is now my prediction it will happen.

&#x200B;

  Weaknesses

GME is a shit-tier retailer. Don't ever forget this. Any business turnaround will take years. There is no magic button to push that will make them profitable enough to match the valuation. The valuation is insane. The stock will eventually return to normal. In one or two years, I think the stock will be back to 'normal' (eg 10-20x NTM EBITDA). The market can stay irrational for a very, very long time, however. The folly of the long-short hedgie (I include myself here), is the idea that the self-annointed master of the universe knows the 'real' valuation a stock should be, presses a button and expects it to happen. This is what happens when keeping it real goes wrong.

Short interest cuts both ways. ""Smart"" traders are all crowded to bet that your stock is going to go down. Usually that's not a good thing. Usually, but not always (see APPX a long time ago, which was a very crowded short which did just fine. HLF more recently).

Self-fulfilling prophecy: the higher the stock gets the more reason longs have to sell. The ""hold the line"" philosophy is stupid. Once you can take a million dollars in profits (or whatever number is a lot for you), you should and you will.

&#x200B;

  Opportunities

A real investor shows up. Carl Icahn likes to play poker. A Saudi investor. Anyone who could file a 13G is what you need, not a tweet. Right now 5% is $1B.

Silly little things: Ryan becomes CEO, company acquires CD Projekt or some other smart move, etc. No news can justify the stock price, but management has to do something to keep the momentum going if you're going to see sustained success.

&#x200B;

  Threats

After 6 months, Ryan Cohen can take money off the table. After a 50x, who would not?

The SEC, the Fed, brokers and banks may try to pop the GME bubble as they may view it as systematically dangerous. After all, what stock could be next? I would not be surprised at various events: a prolonged stock halt, 100% margin requirement, huge ATM/stock offering from the company, litigation, etc. Expect the unexpected.

&#x200B;

Market Participants

  Elon Musk and Chamath mean nothing unless they buy a lot. Musk has credit, less so cash, so it's unclear he would play. You need a cash rich guy (Icahn, Soros, Saudis) to show up. I don't think the hedgies are interested in getting long since the mark-to-market is too much for them. Permanent capital is the only buyer, and finding a permanent capital semi-irrational buyer at this point is unlikely.

  Rumors Melvin is out. Not surprised at all, if anything, surprised it took this long.

&#x200B;

Final Words

  Please don't have more than even a third (previously 50%) of your portfolio in this stock. It is at an outlandish price and while it may get more outlandish, it is quite dangerous. Don't use leverage or margin. I've seen too many train wrecks (some of my own) and failures because of greedy behavior. My family and I have not traded a share of GME. Prison makes it hard to do anything like trade. If anything I'd be long a small amount, betting the borrow fees make up for any underlying stock losses and the insanity persists throughout the year.

&#x200B;

Media pushing the story of hedge funds being victims to “Reddit traders.” Of course it’s our fault they lost money - just like it’s their fault every time we lose money. 

Ever go long just to wake up to some bs report downgrade from some nobody analyst at a big firm? A random event completely unrelated to your stock forcing you to sell for a loss? A short selling firm announcing opening a position on stock you own? The examples are endless.

The fact that these hedge funds are literally crying and complaining over the major media networks is absolutely satisfying af. 

They forget they don’t control the markets - greed and fear controls the market. 

Unfortunately, I’m sure this will lead to some sort of change to help the hedge funds from incurring losses like this again. 

Still, a small victory for the little guy. And I can’t help but laugh at these old hedge fund execs going on media promoting regulation and trying to influence the sec to “hall these speculators to jail.”

&#x200B;

**DD:**

1. BBBY is one of the highest shorted stocks following GME with a 84 short percentage of float
2. The CEO who turned around Target joined BBBY in Nov 2019, since then, he had kicked out and replaced all original C-Suite
3. BBBY has been transforming and selling all non-core business for profitability and better liquidity
4. The company announced a $675 Million share buyback in the next 3 years, given current share price, that will reduce the amount of shares by 15%, which essentially making BBBY another more than 100% shorted company
5. Guess who also shorts BBBY? Yeah fucking Melvin. Read their 13F, as of Nov 2020, the $ amount of their BBBY short positions is actually higher than their GME short positions. When they are forced to liquidate their positions, BBBY will be short-squeezed as well

BBBY is like the little brother of GME. There is no conflict between buying BBBY and GME, it is another way to fuck Melvin without paying extreme high premiums on GME calls.

I know this isn't a GME post but it may be a great place to roll some tendies when GameStop hits $1000 on Friday. GME could actually hit $1000 Friday.

First, check the chart. Today CRSR is up 5% even while the broader market ate shit at open. Buyers came in hot.

After peaking at $51, The stock pulled back smartly. Since then, CRSR has been consolidating while setting higher highs and higher lows every couple of weeks.

$CRSR had a non-dilutive offering last week at $35 per share. This didn't add shares, just gave their initial PE firm a chance to cash out. With 7M shares sold at $35, this built a solid new ""floor"" for the stock on high volume at $35. Corsair easily digested this move and broke out to $40 before pulling back a bit today. Personally I used today as a chance to sell $25k in puts and buy $25k in calls for Feb 19. Will add more calls on any weakness for the rest of the week.

What does this have in common with GME? Corsair has 36% short interest (obviously lower than GME), but the main IPO lock up period doesn't expire til March. Corsair's current available float is only 20% of total shares outstanding while short interest is 36%. Not a lot of shares available for shorts to cover if the stock starts moving against them.

Last week LOGI crushed earnings, and I fully expect CRSR to do the same. I'm planning to sell the calls pre-earnings if CRSR runs $45+, but won't be buying to close the puts until near expiration. Assuming CRSR outperforms, it could break out above $50 and beyond. Worth a look imo. Always GME TO THE MOON, but this could be the next play.

Not investment advice, just my opinion. Long calls and short puts."|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163921.csv|StockTicker|['CRSR']|[]|['CRSR', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'CRSR', 'CRSR', '$CRSR', 'PE', 'M', 'I', 'GME', 'IPO', 'LOGI', 'I', 'CRSR', 'CRSR', 'CRSR', 'GME', 'TO', 'THE', 'MOON']|['GME', 'GME', 'PE', 'M', 'GME', 'LOGI', 'GME']

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, why do I want to see AMC be the next GME? 

Because I'm from the 90's (which indeed makes me an old fuck). The reason I loved the idea of pushing GME is because it reminds me of my childhood. I used to love going to EBs (which merged with GME), browsing games, buying them and looking at the booklets.

It's the same reason I love AMC. The movie theaters were an escape for me growing up. I'm not going to give a sob story because no one gives a shit... in fact, I'm sure no one gives a shit about anything I just said.

#We go until the hedge funds are destroyed

Stop setting sell limits at 1000, stop telling people we go until 1000, and **STOP** thinking about 1000. 1000 is for ugly people and the last time I checked, our mommy's have always told us that we are the handsomest little men she's ever seen.

1000 is only a 4-5x away from happening and we just tripled the stock price from EoD Monday in 24 hours. All you 🌈🐻, 🧻👐'ed wannabe 💎🦍's are going to cause a self-induced crash BACK DOWN and sell off in the hedge funds' favor.

**Here's why:**

The hedge fund's know they're beat. They know they have to incur serious losses. But they also know that 9/10 of you losers plan to sell at 1k and that all of you except the true believes of Our Lord DFV will panic sell to escape missing the squeeze.

Sooooo, the hedge funds start their buying BUT STOP near $1k. Then you morons all go ""hurr durr this measly 2x must be the squeeze hurr durr I don't know math let me exit with my $3 profit"" and it will cause the price to go down while hedge funds scoop up the discounted shares all the way down and live to laugh at us all

#STOP ACTING LIKE THIS EVENT IS THE 🚀 THAT YOU PAY 50 CENTS TO RIDE OUTSIDE OF WALMART

I, personally, am not even THINKING about so much as YAWNING at my screen until we start approaching $2k. This is MUCH bigger than VW was in my opinion and that itself was like a 5x event. These hedge funds have quadrupled down and we could be looking at a squeeze that happens at any moment that brings this price into the multiple thousands depending on just how greedy these billionaires got over the last year. If I'm wrong, whatever, but I don't want to make this event a footnote in history as opposed to a whole page.

#TL;DR tell any 🌈🐻 you see who thinks the goal of this train is a paltry $1000 share price to shove it up his ass and wipe it with his 🧻👐 because this 🚀 is going higher than the year on our calendars

There are HUNDREDS of these accounts active right now.    

Low karma accounts, new or many years old with no submissions for weeks/months/years. Suddenly now telling you to buy AMC, NOK, BB, etc.

The institutions are pay people to manipulate you.      

DON'T BUY INTO THEIR BULLSHIT!    

BE PATIENT! I'M NOT EVEN GONNA CONSIDER SELLING UNTIL THIS SHIT HITS $1000!

(This isn't investment advice.) 

I am holding $150 calls I bought for $4.43 and just today bought more shares at $330 I'M NOT FUCKING SELLING!

I don't have direct evidence of this yet, but when I saw [https://downdetector.com/](https://downdetector.com/) today, it made me wonder if the Hedge Fund SOBs were funding DDoS attacks against the retail investment sites?

The economics of DDoS are pretty simple.  For $10,000 you can effectively bring nearly any site to its knees for a period of hours. So, if we assume that the retail investment sites like Robinhood, et. al. are down for most of the day, it could provide a window for the HF SOBs to cover their shorts because orders cannot be processed.

Imagine you're a HF SOB, you're looking at potentially billions in losses, what would a few hundred grand be to throw at keeping the retailer Robinhood crowd from placing trades long enough to bring GME down from the stratosphere? Get it down into the double-digits, save your hedge fund from a bailout or leverage from the big Wall Street bosses...

Again, no direct evidence yet, but the crowd I run with in my day job watches DDoS events pretty closely, and there is something phishy going on today."|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163914.csv|StockTicker|['S']|['S']|['I', 'K', 'I', 'I', 'S', 'S', 'HF', 'HF', 'SOB', 'GME', 'I', 'S']|['K', 'S', 'S', 'HF', 'HF', 'GME', 'S']

WSB has loved its $GME calls and shares since November/ December. Many of us are gamers, so when we heard our spot was having a hard time, we bought some shares to show our support. This had nothing to do with you -- many of us didn't even know you existed (not Gabe at least, some folks knew about Andrew). We were happy that $GME picked up a little (to $20 then $30). 

And then you guys had to go and short $GME. We didn't make that decision for you. You decided to tweet (Andrew, looking at you here) that $GME was worth only $20. We decided you're wrong. We don't want to sell at that price. We didn't even want to sell at $40. Many people still don't want to sell at $250.

Recently, Andrew released a video and Gabe called to CNBC. Both of you claim you got out/ closed your positions. That's nice -- we don't believe you, but that's nice. One of our many sources report there are still 44.79 of the 47.93 million shares on loan, and only 1.9 days left to pay it back. ([GameStop Corp., NYSE:GME | Short Interest | Flagged Changes | Largest Shorts | Cost To Borrow - ORTEX](https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts)). This doesn't square with your statements. 

So don't take it personally. Yes, it sucks to lose billions when many wsb folks are cheering their unexpected gains -- gains that will help them pay off their student loans, buy their first house or car, help their aging and ailing relatives put food on the table, or cover healthcare costs incurred during the pandemic. It's not about you. It's just that we like the stock.

Never posted because I just like lurking the sub. All of this talk of GME recently has left the sub feeling one dimensional and seems to discourage other potential winning stocks. 

People seem to think everything is a comparison to GME. It isn't. Some people want to invest in BB because it looks more promising with it's tech and pivoting market strategy. Some people want AMC because it tanked due to a pandemic and they want to keep the largest movie theater chain alive or see the potential in recovery. (AMC was over $30 pre-COVID.)

There are many posts discouraging or dissuading people from investing in other companies, but particularly those 2. Yes I'm on the GME rocket 🚀🚀🚀. But that doesn't mean I can't make other healthy investments that have potential too.

As of posting, we're on the brink of bankrupting at least one hedge fund and making some sweet gains for ourselves. 

Now for the bad news: this has drawn a lot of attention to us. Now that the big boys have seen what can happen to them, they are going to want to protect their own primacy in the market. This has been building for some time, research shows that hedge funds [underperform](https://www.investopedia.com/retail-faves-are-beating-hedge-fund-mutual-fund-picks-5024920) compared to retail investors. This is only the most high profile example of that to date. 

Because of this, they will probably lobby congress or the SEC to pass some regulation that limits us, the stinky commoner, from being able to trade. I don't know what this will look like exactly but major figures, including Michael Burry, are saying there needs to be regulation. Ask yourself, since when has wall street been in favor of regulation? Did they say they needed it after 2008 when they tanked the housing market? No! But now that they've been embarrassed by a bunch of degenerates that's when it's really needed. This is about protecting themselves. 

So, what should you do about it? Call your house representative and senators! You can figure out how to reach your house rep [here](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) and your senators [here](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm).

When you call them, be respectful and polite, you'll most likely be dealing with an unpaid intern just trying to get through the day. Let them know you are a constituent of theirs and want them to know you are against any efforts by wall street or regulators to limit your ability to access the stock market. 

We need to let them know there is a large constituency, spread out across numerous districts in the US, that will turn out to vote against them if they screw us on this. 

Ideally, if we can kick up enough dust early on this, that'll kill any attempts to block our access before it gets off the ground. Good luck everyone!"|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163940.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['SEC', 'I', 'US']|[]

Don’t be a primadonna pussy and buy NOK

We are literally changing people’s lives in here**. We are doing the shit the corrupt, greedy hedge funds claim but fail to do.

These shorting boomer fuckwads want to get rich by selling us their aged smegma, and they want us to spend our whole lives giving them money to do it. They want us to invest “responsibly” so that we’ll earn just enough to outpace inflation, maybe retire with a decent sum. That’s fucking lame, and it’s fucking boring. *I WANNA BE RICH NOW.* You think these hedge fund managers are investing responsibly like they tell their clients to do, hedging their bets, saving their money and living clean? They are balls deep in their 4th hooker and working on their third eight ball by lunch time (if they’re a junior partner). **WHY NOT US. I WANT TO BE RICH NOW.**

WSB is just a subreddit, AND YET IT’S SO MUCH MORE. We are a bunch of fucking retarded autists that have formed an unstoppable nuclear internet hivemind. Nearly 3 fucking million of us thinking, acting, encouraging, nurturing, and fucking HELPING each other.

It’s like every great struggle in history, all the way back to the biblical story of David vs. Goliath. The little man versus the behemoth. Us verses the boomer hedge fund big money shorting assholes who fuck us over time and time again with impunity, always safely escaping with their golden parachutes to numb their emotions with a Tony Montana-sized pile of cocaine in their penthouse suites overlooking Central Park as two hookers spray diarrhea over their faces like oil spewing from the Exxon-Valdez.

AND THEY THINK THEY'RE FUCKING BETTER THAN US. They DESPISE us. For our youth, for our energy, for our love, for our autism. They have nothing. Understand that. They are no better, no smarter than us. Our weaponized hivemind of fearless retardation TERRIFIES them. WE DON’T FUCKING NEED THEM ANYMORE. THEY ARE LYING AND MANIPULATING THE MARKET AND TRYING EVERY TRICK BUT WE WILL ALWAYS CATCH THEM BECAUSE WE ARE FUCKING STUPID BUT THEY ARE EVEN DUMBER. IF LITERAL BLINDFOLDED MONKEYS CAN INVEST BETTER THAN THEM, WHAT THE FUCK DO WE HAVE TO FEAR.

**We stay in this together. We do it for each other. We all win this together.**

We do it for the unknown Redditor who uses his winnings to pay off his student debt. For the anonymous construction worker who downloaded Robinhood and, in one week, earned enough to pay off his debts and buy his family a new Toyota. We do it for our lord and savior DFV who is watching his return vary by the millions without flinching. Who showed us all that if we dare to YOLO like a retard, anything is possible. We all have it within ourselves to accomplish something great, something truly bigger than ourselves, if we just work together.

Remember that one day, we will all be old and gray. Our bodies will grow frail as the years go by and eventually we’ll be stuck reminiscing on the lives we’ve lived. Long after the fires of youth have faded from our eyes, we will remember truly being part of something amazing and changing the lives of MILLIONS of people for the better. As we think back on the $GME era, a smile will creep across our wrinkled old faces AS WE RELAX IN OUR RETIREMENT CASTLES ON FUCKING MARS WHILE 12 MARTIAN GODDESSES GIVE US TENTACLED TONGUEBATH MASSAGES BECAUSE WE RODE THE $GME ROCKETSHIP POWERED BY PAPA MUSK AND BOOMER TEARS ALL THE WAY TO THE FUCKING RED PLANET AND MADE ENOUGH TO FUCKING BUY IT WHEN WE GOT THERE.

I’M NOT FUCKING LEAVING. I LIKE THE STOCK. AND I LOVE ALL YOU FUCKING IDIOTS TOO. APES TOGETHER STRONG. HOLD YOUR STOCKS AND HOLD YOUR COCKS BOYS AND GIRLS WE ARE IN THIS TO WIN THIS. $10,000 IS NOT A MEME.

I haven't had this much to eat in a while.  


Thank you, autists. I appreciate you all."|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163910.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', '$GME', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['GME']

Helllooooo Autists! It's me, ya boy. Back to talk some more about my favorite play right now, Microvision! **I have used this dip opportunity to more than double my previous position. Positions at bottom.**

As you all know from my [post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5hwiu/microvisions_macrovision_the_story_of_an/), Microvision is unbelievably undervalued in the marketplace right now. They have not only have **best in class LiDAR** for consumer and automotive (TWO verticals!), but they also have **best in class MEMS** displays (MSFT Hololens 2 and IVAS display, another vertical and **MSFT with a gov contract!**)!

# WHY I'M BACK AGAIN

Mainly for two reasons then we can jump in

1. **A POTENTIAL MAJOR CATALYST COMING TOMORROW**
2. The current formation of the chart looks **IDENTICAL TO THE LAST RUN FROM $3 TO $9+**

# Reason 1 - System Plus Consulting full Hololens 2 teardown and report available tomorrow

This is could be a **MAJOR** catalyst tomorrow when this [full report is released](https://www.systemplus.fr/reverse-costing-reports/microsoft-holographic-lens-from-hololens-2/). As we already know, thanks to the guys over at r/MVIS [(LINK TO THREAD)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/l61w3p/microsoft_holographic_lens_from_hololens_2_system/), the Hololens 2 **IS CONFIRMED TO USE MICROVISION MEMS DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY -** [SOURCE 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/gm1i2f/hololens_2_teardown_the_hunt_for_mvis/)(8 months ago) **+** [SOURCE 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/kxf2to/microvision_mems_mirror_in_the_hololens_2_the/)(12 days ago)**. This should finally lift the veil on Microvision and start getting more institutional and retail investors jumping in.**

&#x200B;

# Reason 2 - Crayon drawings look IDENTICAL to last 300% pop!

**Please forgive me for my awful crayon drawing, I had to use an old box because I ate all the new ones.....but check this out!**

[🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/ufmg7qbwfwd61.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=789b3ba55ccf39d855024c41039eabd31b5e2902)

Wow! What a chart! If you want a **more in-depth look,** [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck7IvrgglDw&feature=emb_title). But Look at all those circles! I've even color-coordinated them, to help our smooth brains. All I'll say is, compare the circles. See how each one looks like it is setting up to be identical?

1. Green circles - The first one is the first 3 days of upwards movement towards the boom, looking like we have the first few bars of that setup already
2. Red circles - the second one looks like it is going to finish today with a lot of indecisiveness in the direction and suppression from the resistance line right there. **This is playing out the same exact way as last time**. Last time we fucked with a heavy resistance then broke it and started the major run the next day.
3. Blue circles - Check out those increasing volume trends. If you can see the faded brown circles in the blue ones, check out the low ass volume coming in on those days followed by a **BOOM**
4. Black circles - RSI, you probably haven't read this far but looks like we can run up and out of the purple again

**IF HISTORY HOLDS TRUE, WE CAN SEE A 300+% PRICE MOVEMENT IN THE COMING DAYS.**

# CONCLUSION

To wrap this up, let's take another quick look at the LiDAR competitors in the market...

**Luminar (LAZR)**

* **Stock Price - $39.39 (+$3.07, +8.25%)**
* **Market Cap - 12.731B**
* **Float - 177.19M**
* **Shares outstanding - 218.82M**

**Velodyne (VLDR)**

* **Stock Price - $26.23 (+$1.08, +4.22%)**
* **Market Cap - 4.433B**
* **Float - 55.52M**
* **Shares Outstanding - 168.71M**

**Wow!** Look at those market caps! Now let's see how Microvision compares...

**Microvision (MVIS)**

* **Stock Price - $7.79**
* **Market Cap - 1.02B**
* **Float - 145.69M**
* **Shares outstanding - 151.31M**

Just looking at the pure numbers and math of how this works out, **MVIS SHOULD SEE A PRICE TARGET OF AT LEAST 3X, IF NOT 4-6X!** And that is just looking at the **ONE AUTOMOTIVE LIDAR VERTICAL**. **If you add in their other verticals? Holy shit can this baby start to FLY**🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

**TL:DR - MICROVISION IS STILL EXTREMELY UNDERVALUED BY AT LEAST 3X, CHART LOOKS IDENTICAL TO LAST 300% RUN, THEY ARE BEST IN CLASS IN MULTIPLE VERTICALS**

**TL:CR - $MVIS**  🌙🌚🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Any short squeeze in silver paper shorts would be EPIC. 
We know billion banks are manipulating gold and silver to cover real inflation.

Both the industrial case and monetary case, debt printing has never been more favorable for the No. 1 inflation hedge Silver.

Inflation adjusted Silver should be at 1000$ instead of 25$. Link to post removed by mods.

Why not squeeze $SLV to real physical price.

Think about the Gainz. If you don't care about the gains, think about the banks like JP MORGAN you'd be destroying along the way.

- they both are under the most shorted stock catalog
-they both have around 85% float in shorts resource reference

-$BBBY is also a Melvin short position resource reference

I'm an ""ordinary"" investor who just buys based on fundamentals. I bought Macerich (MAC) stock a while back for about $15 a share because I believe in the long-term fundamentals of the company. But the share price got driven down to as low as $5 by short sellers, who made up over 80% of float just a couple days ago.

Then, you all taught short sellers a lesson with GameStop. I don't know if it's you guys, or just a spillover effect, but there's a short squeeze going on with MAC now, and I'm living. MAC is up over 100% in less than a month. I still think it's undervalued and has a long way to go, but it's heading in the right direction now. I'm glad there are finally people out there putting the squeeze on greedy short sellers who were ignoring the fundamental value of a company to try to make a quick buck. 

Thank you, and keep up the good work."|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163921.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['I', 'I', 'I', 'MAC', 'MAC', 'I']|['MAC', 'MAC']

No not at all, what’s happening to GME isn’t a fucking pump and dump scheme. It has actual merit and the price is based on short sellers getting squeezed.

If you want this sub banned after the dust settles then go ahead carry on screaming about the “next pump” or “target”. You won’t get very far before the sec shuts you down for market manipulation. And if you think that’s a pipe dream don’t think for one second that Reddit wouldn’t give your details up, because they would in a heartbeat if a government body asked for it.

Don’t let yourself get manipulated by rocket emojis and buy now BS.

Edit: Mods please put a karma limit on until this at least blows over. The bots are spamming the sub

[edit: to prove my point that people will blindly follow chants and rocket emojis, I challenged someone on their DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l69m1f/the_absolute_state_of_this_sub_right_now_mods/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Final edit: we aren’t a private stock market army, this war with GME was waged by the institutions that stood to manipulate the market for their own gain. We don’t do that here and that culture of “today’s pump/gains” will die with the GME short sellers.

**I made this post because people in real life started to message me about stocks they have been told “people on reddit” are pumping next and to get into early. It’s lies and it’s wrong and ordinary people are going to get hurt.**

I'm completely guessing here. But the lack of age in the NOK and AMC posts is a FACT. I just reported several as spam.

Disclosure: I am long GME. Fuck the funds. Not financial advice, this post is a statement of fact about the account age of recent NOK and AMC spam in this sub.

Edit: tons of comments here so if you're seeing this here is the advice I have. This is not financial advice, it's standard Reddit advice.

&#x200B;

today i want to introduce you to Nokia #NOK. 🚀

The year is 1865 in Finland – NOK was founded. Our beloved God Elon didnt even exist as a sperm back then; nor did your boomer grandpa. NOK took vegetables and made paper out of it. Then they decided to make phones and computers. 

In 2014 NOK sold their phone business to Microsoft for billions. Microsoft sold it to HMD global. NOK still receives royalties for their name. So NOK is not a phone company anymore (do not confuse the 2 when researching). 

Today, NOK is far more advanced than making paper from paprika or selling undestructable phones. By taking over a joint-venture from Siemens in 2013, Alcatel-Lucent in 2015 and continuous work, aquisitions and research, they now pose as a major player in hardware and software for critical communication technology. More about this later.

In August last year (2020), NOK hired one of their key phone infrastructure employees back. He was there from 1990 – 2000. And now he is back as CE fucking O. 🚀

In between 2000-2020 he did some random shenanigan CEO stuff. His name is Pekka (#CoC) Lundmark. NOK have 2 other new executives, very capable.

5G - The economic future outlook is looking very juicy compared to NOK’s share price: 

NOK has a market share of 22%. Sure, Ericsson has 26, Huawei has 28.5%. But Huawei is kicked out of Europe, North America, and now many more.The list of countries banning Huawei is growing fast. Who is happy to take over, even in asia? (look at Singapore, partly Thailand f.e.) NOK, Samsung, Ericsson. NOK will have a pie of it. 🚀

[https://www.channele2e.com/business/enterprise/huawei-banned-in-which-countries/](https://www.channele2e.com/business/enterprise/huawei-banned-in-which-countries/)

EV with autonomous driving will need 5G to be connected perfectly. Also autonomous traffic such as drones will rely on this heavily. Guess who produces infrastructure for this, and offers safe communication infrastructure solutions already tested? NOK. 🚀

The finnish, norwegian and swedish governments already bought into NOK. 5G with secure critical infrastructure is a big deal.  

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-08/finland-is-building-its-nokia-stake-in-response-to-u-s-interest-ketqcpo7](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-08/finland-is-building-its-nokia-stake-in-response-to-u-s-interest-ketqcpo7)

What else? NOK is involved in cyber-security slightly similar to #BB BlackBerry. 

Nokia Smart Grid for securing power stations; Network security in general; IOT security and Railway infrastructure security.

5G will be developed faster than you think. According to Ericssons 2020 mobility report, 40% of all mobile internet subs will be 5G – 3.5 billion users in 2026. You might think thats 6 years still, but remember that its 40% of all mobile subs, and where are 3.5bn of subs? Except EU and NA – think China, India, South america, africa, south east asia. Massive numbers.

With one deal, NOK managed to secure 2.2bn$ in 2018.

Research & Development: 

NOK is the flagship for 6G research in the EU.

NOK is working with NASA to put 4G and 5G on the fucking MOON. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

[https://www.satellitetoday.com/telecom/2021/01/04/bringing-lte-to-the-moon-nokia-exec-talks-nasa-tipping-point-contract/](https://www.satellitetoday.com/telecom/2021/01/04/bringing-lte-to-the-moon-nokia-exec-talks-nasa-tipping-point-contract/)

I didnt look to far in research and development; NOK has claimed some 3000 patents for 5G, but Huawei is the leader right now. What seems interesting though is that NOK is ahead in confirmed patents. 

https://preview.redd.it/0m0suzawnwd61.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&s=635e3eeb409ada0404f6caae272b77066224c523

&#x200B;

The discussion about the patent leaders are diffuse. TwoBirds said that Ericsson was leading, with Huawei questioned as to if their numbers were legit. Qualcomm is also a major player. 

**My point though is that NOK’s stock is still flat,** while Qualcomm and the others significantly gained. (Except Huawei, political risk)

9/28/20 Finland Grows Nokia Stake In Response to US Interest. The state’s equity-asset manager Solidium Oy recently crossed the 5% threshold in Nokia shares, and now has about €1 billion (US$1.2 billion) worth of stock.

**Conclusion:**

NOK is worth a buy IMO. Traffic of tomorrow will rely heavily on secure 5G infrastructure. NOK’s basic revenue is solid, cash flow positive. They will pay dividends, and are a big competitor in a growing sector. They will need their time though, they wont skyrocket next month. 

This is not a YOLO play. As u/ST_McD pointed out, NOK is not the next GME. I see good upside on this stock though, around 100% until next year. 

For 2 other good DD's on this, check u/ST_McD and u/zepherance. Special thanks to u/zepherance, I used some info from ur DD. 

&#x200B;

Position: long 4000 @ 3.85 Eur. Looking to get calls soon - 8c Jan 22. 

This is not financial advise, I'm not a bot and this is not distortion of GME - im holding.

This was during the ""dot com boom"" -- money was flying everywhere.

I hung out with a bunch of traders in one group who once paid my friend $150 just to watch him lick capsaicin off a spoon (the concentrated liquid part of hot peppers) and then all laugh as he had to chug milk. There was money flying everywhere. I was 17. For Christmas that year, I made $1800 in cash in tips from the guys that I worked for.

I would watch these degenerates come in early in the morning after going out all night, doing blow, shit their brains out from drinking, sometimes pass out in a chair, go stand on the trading floors, get in fist fights (I've definitely been knocked in the head in the Dow futures pit), and generally just act like animals.

These are the ""financial markets"" that everyone praises and bails out with our tax dollars. Everyone talks about their ""401k"" and our ""economy is so great"", the ""stock market is at an all time high"" -- let me tell you: none of it means shit, and everyone here figured it out. We finally have a means of communicating en masse, to take back the financial power from these dopes. I saw guys with barely a high school diploma, come in and get rich, just because it's all loaded and manipulated.

Our entire financial market is literally based on the whims of ex-frat boy cokeheads. They deserve everything that's coming to them.

I'm proud of all of you, I'm here for it."|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163912.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']|[]

Reddit accounts are bought and sold all the time.  **DO NOT BE DISTRACTED.  DOWNVOTE THESE POSTS.  UPVOTE GME.**  This is how you know they are truly desperate.  It is literally a last ditch effort on all fronts to defeat us.  None of the accounts spamming NOK or any of the other tickers has a history of posting here, or anywhere recently, if they have any other posts at all.

All options are in the money.  Short interest has not fallen.  Do not give in.  Do not sell.  Do not be distracted.  Together we will win.  **Survive today, and witness the gamma squeeze force a short squeeze the world has never seen. APE TOGETHER STRONG.**

Do not let these destroyers of memes ruin our chances, they can reduce our ability to focus our energy onto $GME.

Don't forget about our lord and saviour who will buy Melvin's home and open a gamestop within it. Let our memes live, make this Coronavirus be remembered for something other than death and suffering that it has already caused but instead have the end of it be remembered the time when retail investors banded together, donated to charity with the funds they earned, wiped student debt off a lot of people's minds, in some cases secure a home, in others the next pay cheque that keeps them afloat or allows them to pay rent (for you true yolo players)

Together, and only together can we overcome the financial power infront of us, the line is wavering, don't let it break.

It's still under $15, less than half its ATH of $35.

GME hit $380 today, up *six times* its all time high of $63. That ridiculous price jump is going to scare away non-autist retail investors, and at that price, new buyers will be expending multiples more capital for the same upward pressure. I'm willing to bet that most of the diamond hang gang are in GME up to their tits and now going through their mothers' purse for more capital.

Also, #saveAMC is already trending, while people are *actively looking* for a new GME they feel they missed the boat on.

Despite how low the price already was, it has a record number of shorts - over 38 million, meaning another short squeeze is on the menu.

AMC has raised a billion dollars to weather out coronavirus, they have a ""Safe & Clean"" push, and they are going to be throwing out deals to everyone for them to come see the blockbusters that Hollywood has been sitting on after watching Tenet and WW1984 eat shit on streaming:

Coronavirus, the main cause for AMC's big downturn, is on the way out as vaccines will be available to all by spring, just ahead of summer blockbuster season.

Brick and mortar game stores *will* have less of a future, with or without coronavirus. There is no way to mount a 20 foot screen in your house. Unless, of course, you buy AMC stock now.

Here's the 200 shares I bought *yesterday* for the pittance of under a grand. I'm buying *a lot* more today.

Not much different than hedge funds getting together for sharing info dinners and playing momentum. Big cats on wall street have screwed retail for years. This time, retail (US, the little guys) are playing the 138 percent mass over-shorted position of GME and retail is winning. The little people are winning on this one. Chamath donated his $500K profit to the Barstool fund that is helping small business hit by Covid.

Video link below.

Host was often combative with him, Chamath kept coming back making sense. He's brilliant and I'm so glad his voice was heard today.

It's been a 30+ minute interview and is incredible. Host asked him if he can come back after the break. Someone needs to post it asap for all to see.

(quotes are as accurate as I could type...they're a close approximation)

edit: The 2nd half of the interview included talking with Jon Najarian who shorted GME yesterday and tweeted at Chamath. Chamath (referring to WSB / Reddit and similar groups/forums) ""These kids are catching up fast...they know what they're doing...we are leveling the playing field...there are a lot of smart people behind the screen name.""

Host Scott might not understand or agree with this movement and is arguing against it...Chamath argues we need more transparency...""force \[the large hedge funds\] to show you what they're doing under the covers. Some of these funds are taking 50B and running it like 500B. That's the REAL risk in the room.""

Chamath to host Scott at the end: ""Be on the right side of this.""

It ended at 12:51pm eastern time. WOW. Someone will likely have the ability to capture the interview and post it somewhere later today.

Alright fellow Autists and Autits - here's the nitty gritty: **Wall Street is scared SHITLESS** today with all the retail buying in **NOK**. This may very well be GME 2.0 - *not* because of the short interest, but because of the blatant manipulation attempts by using Halts. Here is why they are scared...

**530 MILLION shares traded**

As of the time of this post, 530 MILLION shares have traded today compared to a meager 65 million shares traded daily on average. That's nearly 10x the usual daily volume!!! This volume shows our WSB army is strong and they are scrambling in fear!!!! (Hope they wore their brown pants)

**NOK making new highs at $8.81**

At the time of this post, NOK is currently trading at $6.67, down from the ATH of $8.81! It would be trading higher if it weren't for the volatility halts - MM's attempts at keeping price low. But we will not relent!!!

**Gamma Squeeze Incoming!**

\- Here's where things get extra extra spicy!!! Jan 29 Call Options only go up to a $8 strike. This morning, Open Interest was a staggering 150,345 contracts - of which 127,301 contracts are currently ITM!!!!

\- In ADDITION to the Open Interest, 278,065 moar contracts have traded today!!

\- As of right now, it is estimated that if price hits $7 by Friday, 408,777 contracts will be IN THE FUCKING MONEY which translates to an additional **408,777,000 SHARES that will need to be bought for option holders this FRIDAY**.

**tl;dr NOK looks very very ripe and tasty for a Gamma Squeeze this Friday which may drive shares up even further!**

If we allow our sub to be co-opted or manipulated by those with ulterior motives we risk seeing the subreddit turned into a bot/shill battleground, and I don’t think any of us want that. I’m making this post to ask the mods to take action and limit the ability to make posts to those who have either been members of the sub for more than a month or who have accounts older than a month.

I've been here since 2016 and I've seen some fucked up shit. I have even been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stonk Disorder (PTSD).

Some of you are up 200, 300, 400% on your GME positions right now, and still holding. I commend you for your diamond sacks, but lets not underestimate how evil, greedy, and cunning, big money can be.

Short interest is around 98% last I looked at the Ortex data a few hours ago.

#NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH OF THE CURRENT SHORT POSITIONS WERE OPENED AT THESE NEW LEVELS

At this point, all of the original shorts who were deeply underwater, have covered and gotten out. There is no doubt about that. Why does it matter?

These new shorts which were opened at current levels ARE NOT GOING TO MATTER AS MUCH UNLESS WE GET ANOTHER HUGE MOVEMENT UPWARD. And at this point, honestly ask yourself, what is the catalyst? Every retail investor has already heard about this and bought in, if they were going to. It's not like millions of normies are going to be pouring in to help push the price up to fuck the next level of shorts and cause another squeeze. 

I hate to break it to everyone, but the squeeze people were talking about 2 weeks ago ***HAS ALREADY HAPPENED***.

Is it possible another squeeze on these new short positions could happen? ***ABSOFUCKINGLUTELY***, However..

At this point, what is going to set this thing off? The Ryan Cohen news combined with a swarm of retards on here going all in is what triggered the first squeeze. Then we had news coverage, Elon and Chamath tweeting as the cherry on top. Is it possible that Ryan Cohen drops some big news within the next week or so to pop off short squeeze round 2? Sure. Is it possible some big whale comes along and decides to pump it and fuck the next round of shorts? Sure. But what im saying is, we already got a round of catalysts that were highly unlikely. It is not likely to get any better than we already got. 

#IF YOU ARE UP OVER 100% IT MAY BE TIME TO CALL IT. THERE IS A VERY GOOD CHANCE THAT WE WILL NOT GET ANOTHER BIG CATALYST TO SET OFF SHORT SQUEEZE ROUND TWO. Big money is doing shady shit, there is all sorts of manipulations going on, and just like we saw with the VW squeeze, this will come back down to earth, eventually. If you think GME is still going to be over 300 in a few weeks, you are fucking high. 

I don't know what else to say at this point. There's almost no DD going on here at this point. Every normie and their mother knows whats going on with GME. It's no longer a secret, you aren't getting in early at this point, and some of you are going to be surprised when it comes out that this big short squeeze you hoped for isnt coming because MM, big banks, and big money hedge funds LIED and did shady shit behind the scenes to prevent it.

I guarantee you Chamath closed out his small position already. Michael Burry also has and he even tweeted yesterday about how current levels are concerning. Last but not least, some of you seem to be under the impression that u/DeepFuckingValue is still holding because he thinks it's going to keep going up to 10k. ***He's holding still because it's been his baby for over a year now, he already pulled out a life changing amount of money so he probably doesn't care if it goes back down to 60, and lastly, he's holding as a fuck you to Melvin and company.*** This guy has balls of steel, I wouldn't be surprised if he held until expiration just to prove a point. I don't think this is about money to him anymore, and I don't think its wise or appropriate to interpret his refusal to sell as a sign of conviction in the current price levels, let alone a future price level of $1000.

Lastly, for those of you who have made 100+% returns in just a few days, do you really want to risk it? You realize this is a once in a lifetime event. You will never get this chance again, and if something happens and this thing comes back to earth, you will ***NEVER FORGIVE YOURSELF FOR NOT WALKING AWAY WHEN YOU WERE UP 300% on fucking SHARES ALONE***. ***YOU WILL HATE YOURSELF FOR BEING GREEDY, JUST LIKE MELVIN GOT GREEDY.***.

#SOME OF YOU HAVE WON THE GAME! YOU WON! NOW YOURE JUST TRYING TO RUB DIRT IN THE LOSING TEAMS FACE. EVEN IF THEY DESERVE IT, (WHICH THEY DO) WE NEED TO CONSIDER THAT THIS ISNT GOING TO LAST FOREVER, AND IT MIGHT BE TIME TO CALL IT IF YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO MAKE A 100, 200, 300% RETURN IN 2 FUCKING DAYS.

#No, I am not a bot you fucking idiot, look at my post history.

#Yes, I got out of my GME position earlier today. My total return on GME since last week is 460%. I am happy with that and I am not going to be DUPED into holding by bots and 500k new traders who have no experience and are just bandwagoning space ship emojis. I know better. When the normies flow in, I flow out.

This is crayon markings on drool-soaked construction paper. This is not investment advice. I am not a financial advisor. This is pure fiction.*

**LADDER ATTACK** - from this morning

- Begin 9:30 AM at $351.94
- End 10:15 AM at $249.72

**SHORT POSITIONS CLOSING**

- Short interest as % of float, 10:15 AM: 140.53%
- Short interest as % of float, 11:00 AM: 140.31%

**RESULT**

- Closing 0.22% of short interest compared to float, share price at 11:00 AM - $372.74

**ARBITRARY HYPOTHESIS**

- Short squeeze lasts until, say, ""only"" 70% of float is shorted. Let's assume the big boys have to get out of only half their positions by late [February](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ws97/friday_12921_gme_expiry_date_means_nothing_dont/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), and are finding capital and big grace to worry about the other 70% after Match.
- If 0.22% closure of shorts required +$123 in share price, then an autistic naive ratio means that closing 70% (318 units of 0.22% increments) of open short positions may increase the share price by ($123 x 317 =)  **$39,136.36** above the baseline, wherever that may be.

HOLD THE ROCKET 🚀 .

&#x200B;

# DID Papa Elon approved AMC? NO

# DOES AMC has Papa Ryan Cohen? NO

# First of all, FFL is just 68, not even close to GME 100+.

# Secondly, it is really really cheap to borrow. It is just so cheap to borrow that big boys can hold them like forever without even think about covering...

# Last, the SI dropped significantly, so buy at your own risk, yes you are holding long. But without shorts compete with you, you are just playing offline.

&#x200B;

# Then again, we are creating history, we are saying NO to this rigged system only works for manipulators. Do not get distracted by shitty posts and DDs.

Either way, GME is what started all of this and will be the biggest. I really don’t understand all this AMC and NOK nonsense . I’m long on both tickers, but they’re just not the perfect storm that is GME 

It’s a war, not a battle. You buy your shares in GME now. It sucks you missed the runup to $50, it sucks you missed the runup to $100, and it really sucks to miss the runup to $300. But you know what will feel good? When you unload your shares onto Melvin’s backside

What the hell is going on:

* FUCK AMC
* FUCK BB
* FUCK NOKIA

Let me tell y'all a lil something about GME that none of the other tickers have --- the market makers (Citadel, Jane Street...) are on our side. 

Every single time one of us buys a call, they make a huge $70+ profit on every security. THEY WANT US TO BUY MORE AND ARE HELPING US PUMP. 

When we buy an ATM Call with 53 delta, they sell us a Call and purchase 53 shares for themselves to hedge their risk. As the 🚀 🚀 🚀  flies, they buy more and more stock up to a maximum of 100 shares for every call they sold to us. 

Every time we buy a call, they are forced to purchase shares. SO WHERE DO THEY BUY THEIR SHARES? They call up the big banks, tell their asses to margin call a hoarding hedgefund, who dare bet against 3.1m degenerates living the American dream. 

WE PUMP THEY PUMP WE PUMP THEY PUMP ------ DONT LET THE MUSIC STOP BECAUSE WE ARE THE MUSIC. If your calls have 100 delta already cash out, keep some for charity and buy some more. If your calls are expiring this friday cash out, send some to your beloved mother, and then buy some more. 

AMC  Popped and fizzled today like Caitlyn Jenners estrogen-filled cock after 5 viagras. That ain't r/wsb that's the pussies at r/Stock_Picks. 

GME IS THE SQUEEZE OF ALL SQUEEZES

l6b9av|673.0|We are making history. In 2008, American families were in ruins because Wall Street got too greedy.|t3_l6b9av|0.96|51|51|hot|2021-01-27 21:32:52.000000|ButtFarm69|4|Discussion|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6b9av/we_are_making_history_in_2008_american_families/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6b9av/we_are_making_history_in_2008_american_families/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6b9av/we_are_making_history_in_2008_american_families/|"They made extremely risky trades with astronomical leverage (not unlike what the retail investors are doing right now with GME) and eventually the house of cards fell down. Instead of sending the guys responsible to jail, they got government bailouts and those same execs who started the entire catastrophe ended up with bonus checks and continued to live comfortably in their mansions. In the end, it was the regular American who paid the price, not the guys who caused it. (Don't argue with me about how the regular people were buying multiple houses and being financially irresponsible because it was the venomous snakes in Wall Street that allowed and preyed upon them to do it.)

But this time is different. With the power of the internet, regular Joes like me and you have been able to learn about markets and make our own conclusions about which companies to buy into. And this time, one of us was able to see that something was terribly wrong. Like Michael Burry in The Big Short, what we are witnessing is the reversal of the market exploitation that took place from all of the shorts on Gamestop. How are hedge funds allowed to short a stock past 100%? This is clearly an exploitative practice that was able to happen from the hedge funds trying to bankrupt Gamestop, and one of us caught them with their pants down and then told all of us about it, and now WE, the retail investor, are making them pay.

What we are witnessing is a ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME financial storm. This is 2008 again, except this time, the losers are going to be the hedge funds and the financial fuckers who tried to exploit the system for their own gain. When all this is done, it will be remembered as once of the greatest re-distributions of wealth that this country will EVER see. Billions of dollars in total will be paid out to those of us who followed the GME train, and all of it will be taken from the pockets of the hedge funds like Melvin Capital.

The talking heads on CNBC are worried that the retail investors who are piling into this phenomenon will end up getting hurt because the stock market is a zero-sum game (meaning that there is always a loser when there's a winner). What they don't realize is that this run is not based on fundamentals. No, it is the retail investor capitalizing on catching Melvin with their pants down. And you bet we're gonna grab 'em by the balls and make them scream.

This is not about fundamentals about Gamestop and it is not about free money. This is about us, the underdogs, finally grabbing a piece of the pie that's been hidden from us for all these decades. And guess what...the guys who've eaten well for so long are scared shitless...as they should be. I find it extremely appropriate that the company behind this remarkable event has this slogan: ""Power to the Player.""

For those of you who are interested in why Gamestop is rocketing up, this is the video that started it all for many of the early adopters on this train. It's a 1 hour video explaining in great detail about the FUNDAMENTAL bull case for GME and why it was severely undervalued at around $4 a share at its lowest last year. It was made from /u/DeepFuckingValue, who started this all (who as of yesterday turned his initial 55K investment into over 25mil). [https://youtu.be/GZTr1-Gp74U](https://youtu.be/GZTr1-Gp74U)

There’s a few contenders here, the criteria for all of which is a high % short position. 

Top contenders: Virgin Galactic, Bed Bad and Beyond, AMC, BlackBerry, Palantir

The next short squeeze coming is AMC. AMC is only $.75c away from hitting a gamma squeeze level and we all know that this is what started the original rally in GameStop. It’s already up over 200% today, but don’t be fooled, if we see similar action, this stock can easily go above $50 and even beyond. 🚀🚀🌙🌙🌙

Of course brokers like TD and the CNBC reporters are trying to discourage us from getting into these positions, but who are they to tell us to stop? 🚀🚀

Congrats! But there's something critically important you need to know.

After the dust settles from these squeezes, after GME comes back down from 1000, after the retail sector stabilizes a bit--you need to either hold onto your profits, or LEARN about stock trading!!!

I'm seeing so many people say ""well if I was interested in stocks before I could've done this earlier, clearly it's been going up the entire year, this is easy.""
And seeing those posts makes me sad, because those people are later going to take all of their GME winnings and put it on the trusty weekly OTM calls that have given them success....and then the money will go straight back to the hedge funds writing options.


TL;DR: If you're a first-time investor, LEARN about options and trading BEFORE buying options/shares after the short squeezes end. GME at 350 is nice. But it took a long time, many red days, frustration, and disappointment to get here. HOLD ON TO THE PROFITS after this all finishes, and DO NOT RUSH to make other plays afterwards thinking you're going to multiply the money easily and be a millionaire.

Edit: also, if you're 18-early 20's stop with this bullshit ""I'm rEtIrInG aFtEr tHiS.""

If you like the company hold, if not, sell.


I, like many of you, really like this stock.  I’m thrilled to see the future for GameStop and think Cohen is going to do amazing things.  I grew up in the generation that bought their games from GameStop so it’s a bit of nostalgia for me.  I want to see GME do big amazing things as a company.
I’m a Machiavellian so I immediately recognize manipulation when it’s happening around me.  As if it isn’t obvious, the money is opening doing everything they can to manipulate this stock downward.  It’s so obvious that my 93 year old grandma, who has fallen for the fake virus popups, can see its being manipulated.  

Recap for those of you who have missed it:

-Brokerages restricting trades to reduce volume and upward momentum
-Major talking heads trashing the company with DD that would fail a high school economics class
-those same talking heads accusing retail traders, most who are lower to middle class individuals, as somehow magically being capable of manipulating the market
-Major taking heads trying to bully retail traders by threatening SEC action and new regulations
-Major news organizations pushing potential lies about shorters closing their position with no obvious proof and serious lacking of volume
-Etc, etc

The questions you need to be asking yourself right now if you’re considering abandoning ship, is why are they fighting so hard?  The answer is they believe there is still room for GME to grow.  If this was it, if this is the top, if GME is so stupidly overvalued and we’re all about to become massive bag holders, they would just let it go., laughing their rich fat asses off as we plummet.  The market would fix itself in time and it wouldn’t be a big deal.  But there is room to go and that’s why they have to stop it in its tracks.  The market manipulators can only manipulate for so long.  Hold through and let’s see where this goes in a few days.

The solution is simple: if you like the company hold, if not abandon ship.

This is merely my opinion on the GameStock bull case.

TLDR: Don't be fooled by the media claiming there is no fundamentals involved here. THESE ARE THE FUNDAMENTALS of short squeezes and stock trading. THE STOCK WILL RISE.

DD: The current GameStop infinity squeeze may seem to be ""irrational"", but that is why it is a successful ""to 4200.69"" infinity trade.  All infinity squeezes are the result of heavy over-shorting of shares which then become difficult or impossible to cover - this aggressive over-shorting only occurs when the bear thesis against the fundamentals is conclusively **strong** and very well **disseminated**. In other words, stocks which appear to be the “best short ideas” are also the ones which often end up being most likely to see the most violent short squeezes. The concept that GameStop is an outdated model with a strong ""near zero"" thesis is why our trade is so successful and will continue to be successful.

The more press and losses the hedge fund shorters receive and suffer, respectively, will force more covering of short positions at high prices. The high price is also encouraging more shorts to enter and short, being covered by the older, lower priced shorts but also reducing the shares available to cover the new short. Combined with the holding by longs, this will continue to create shorts. Those who have to cover options writing will have to cover or purchase shares to meet Friday options requirements (this is the GME ""hold til Friday, minimum"" argument).

The more GME rises and the more announcement that the stock is ""dissaociated from fundamentals"" will continue to drive panic of short sellers who will be stepping over each other for the exits. The longer they wait, the higher the squeeze will go.

**FUNDAMENTALLY:** GameStops underlying business model cannot affect its share price as a matter of stock fundamentals. THAT IS THE ENTIRE THEORY OF WSB. **When the number of shares shorted exceeds the tradeable float, the squeeze is a potent, unstoppable force. FUNDAMENTALS OF GAMESTOP'S BUSINESS HAVE NO BEARING ON A SQUEEZE. THE VALUE OF THE STOCK IS IN THE SCARCITY OF SHARES COMBINED WITH DEMAND FROM SHORT SELLERS TO COVER THEIR POSITIONS AND CLOSE OUT THEIR SHORTS.**

***FUNDAMENTALS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND ARE IN PLAY. THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL RULE IN ALL PRICING AND INVESTMENT MODELS.***"|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163910.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['THESE', 'ARE', 'THE', 'NTALS', 'THE', 'STOCK', 'WILL', 'RISE', 'GME', 'GME', 'THAT', 'IS', 'THE', 'NTIRE', 'HEORY', 'OF', 'WSB', 'NTALS', 'OF', 'S', 'INESS', 'HAVE', 'NO', 'ARING', 'ON', 'A', 'UEEZE', 'THE', 'VALUE', 'OF', 'THE', 'STOCK', 'IS', 'IN', 'THE', 'RCITY', 'OF', 'HARES', 'BINED', 'WITH', 'EMAND', 'FROM', 'SHORT', 'LLERS', 'TO', 'COVER', 'THEIR', 'TIONS', 'AND', 'CLOSE', 'OUT', 'THEIR', 'HORTS', 'NTALS', 'OF', 'UPPLY', 'AND', 'EMAND', 'ARE', 'IN', 'PLAY', 'THE', 'MOST', 'ENTAL', 'RULE', 'IN', 'ALL', 'ICING', 'AND', 'TMENT', 'ODELS']|['ARE', 'GME', 'GME', 'S', 'A', 'OUT', 'ARE', 'PLAY', 'ALL']

2) Ongoing discussions over market regulations are happening behind closed doors between lawmakers, the SEC, and top brokerage firms/money managers

3) The current narrative is that GME is a story about ordinary Joe Retail taking on Wall Street greed and corruption- the Chamath interview solidified that. The public is on the side of Retail at this moment. Any attempts to introduce regulations to limit the activities of retail traders would receive significant public backlash.

4) An effort between top lawmakers and mainstream media is fomenting to change the narrative. 

5) Mainstream media outlets will begin solely blaming wsb for the GME debacle, they will begin to paint us as a “fringe group”, they will dig up whatever posts they can to try and portray us as radical, alt-right, racist, etc. They will accuse us of coordinating an effort to deliberately destroy hedge funds, although they will not say the word hedge fund, they will say we have caused major losses in the pension and retirement portfolios of retirees, veterans, police and firefighters, teachers, etc Public perception will flip on wsb. 

6) regulations will be introduced. The general public will accept these regulations and blame wsb for them. 

7) Wall Street greed and corruption thrives while our meme stock gainz languish 

Please pass the message! If you have ever posted anything on WSb That can be used by the media to falsely paint us as a group of radicals or undesirables, delete it!

We all need to continue this fight. GME is a company that has a plan and a new face in Ryan Cohen. If GME can make it out of this, this share price is here to stay. Look at the valuations of other retail companies with significant e-commerce revenue, GME has significant room to go up from here! Hold strong.

AMC’s issues are 100% the result of COVID. They were at peak revenue in 2019. The vaccines are here, the movies are coming out, the people can’t wait to go outside and socialize again.

Motley fool literally DOES THE SAME EXACT FUCKING THING. Analyst on fucking robinhood tell you whether to buy sell or hold. At the end of the day however it is up to each and every one of us to decide whether to yolo or not yolo. If the SEC or one of these hedge funds sues reddit to take down WSB we need to fight back.

Do you guys not like money and selling ads? Are you going to die on a hill thinking the hedge funds will rescue you?

(Case in point, FOX news in the last few months when they drove away a large part of their viewing base. Anyone for a wsb channel? No wait, that's just the REEEEEE on the discord.)

Do you know what you sound like CNBC? You sound like the literal fucks who overleveraged and got everyone into the subprime crisis. You are sounding more and more like the elite, up to the point where you attacked our Gigachad Chamath and every small investor. As GME has shown, this is now beyond making money. This is every small investor now taking a stand. We have been front run, priced out and pushed around since time immemorial.

On yeah, who watches your channel? The little guys. Maybe even the guys who just hold SPY and hope for 10% a year to retire on. They watch CNBC because it's entertaining, but certainly called ""losers"" and ""uneducated"" does not make anyone feel happy. (Does this sound like something that happened around 8 years ago? A certain person called a certain group ""deplorables"")?

We are the ratings and bring in the ads, and keep Kramer still on the air even though >80% of his calls are trash and 5% of those are account blowing trash.

Just shut up and enjoy the ride. Provide analysis and be unbiased. Be quiet even. You think by siding with the funds will keep bringing in revenue? No. Once they don't need you anymore, they will throw you in the trash like their former employees.

But that means the hedge fun guys were bleeding and they had to be protected by the system, since they *are* interwoven into the system. 

But we got fucked over by the system, and now here we are, with WSB once again making tendies and these same dickheads are saying ""SEC/CONGRESS"" protect us!!! Well the Fed can't really bail them out of this mess so gov must act. 

My point is, they don't like it when you make money, it is only when their bottom line is hit when they united, collude to protect their selves."|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163914.csv|StockTicker|['WSB']|[]|['WSB', 'WSB']|[]

GME isn’t going up because of a pump and dump manipulation scheme. GME is not proof that all stocks are a scam.

Institutional investors bet so hard against GME that they became short more than the *total value* of all shares available. It’s like if you’re a hooker and you take $50 from five people to give them a blowie at 5:00 on Friday night. You might think that you’re a shitty hooker and that all five of them are gonna sober up and cancel, but if all your Jons are horny as fuck and wanna keep going, you only got one mouth. You’re fucked, and it’s your own damn fault. You get to suffer the fucking consequences.

All these fucking hedge funds are used to being able to remain solvent for longer than the market can remain rational because they’re playing with so much cash. But, at some point, the king is mother fucking supply and demand, the most powerful fucking force in the universe. 

Supply and demand is why GME is going up. There’s guaranteed demand that’s greater than supply. That’s it. That’s why the stock is raising in price. 

Fuck this “but it’s unfair!” bullshit. America has a remedy for when you fuck your self with debt: declare bankruptcy. Stop crying on CNBC.

This company took a completely unwarranted nosedive from $6 to $3 in the 12 months prior to my purchase. Why? They halted their (very nice) dividend to conserve cash. This was not a bad thing but US boomer investors are pussies. Nokia wants to run the business like an actual business not like a ponzi scheme like Tesla. They accrued a lot of debt in the 2010s - they are Finnish, they hate debt. Why do they have debt? Massive investment in 5G infrastructure all over the world. Nokia is now positioned to be an absolute goldmine for the next generation of mobile networks. 

[https://investorplace.com/2019/11/nokia-stock-dividend-cut/](https://investorplace.com/2019/11/nokia-stock-dividend-cut/)

Since March, NOK has crept up nicely, touching $5 in Summer (no pump needed). It's currently < $7, which is basically FMV for this company going by traditional standards. Forget about the little run-up it had this week so far, that doesn't even scratch the surface of the potential here. 

So here is the deal: You want to go back in time and invest in GME at $5? Now is your chance. Nokia is at a new floor and the short squeeze has not even begun. There is no reason NOK can't get to $15+ on the basis of modern market fundamentals alone. Apply retard logic, and you can even see it hitting $100+ if the entire short bus that is WSB goes full-GME on it.

This is not an anti-GME post or some attempt to distract. Fucking diversify you idiots.

We have just began. As the Autistic Alpha commander in charge, I command we go all in and with full force. We can't stop because we just got started.

The Scum bags are trying to fiddle with their pathetic minds and figuring out all the illegal and dirty ways of manipulating us in ways which we will never understand. But they don't understand that we are autistic af and we don't have to understand. We fight to see loss porn. We don't stop until we see bloods on the wall streets of these short selling fucks.

How come these hedge funds can get a cushion and also get bail outs when we have been loosing for the entirety of our lives. These hedge funds and MM can manipulate the market up and down in their favors and no one bets an eye. When legit retail investors and autistic people get involved TD ameritrade bans trade for us. Do you see a problem because I do.

Wall Street is ran by the people and for the people. We must keep it that way, they have been man handling us for way too long and its about time we show them. We must prove them that the hand that feeds them is actually more powerful their screwed up selves, dirty digging, analysts (Fuck you Melvin and Citron).

GME, BB, ACM, PLTR all the way to the moon.

We need to turn dust into moon dust and show these MM and fucked up dirty corporations that we are autists we don't settle for less. We are weak alone, but together we are strong. We can't be manipulated and mishandled and poked with just like that. GME to $1000 or nothing. Let go all in and show them we don't fear, even fear comes to us and asks us forgiveness. We all are poor compared to these fucks but together we are strong and rich as ever. We might be birthed into poor families but atleast we can live with pride and as warriors. Its time to live the rest of our lives as honored autists veterans.

Unlike these scumbags we are here to fight and make a statement that will resonate with them for ages to come. At any cost possible, we are not going go down easy. THIS IS WAR, we are in it to win it.

This is a DOG EAT DOG WORLD.  if you don't eat then you will get eaten. SO my dear friends and very humbled autists I COMMAND YOU TO EAT. LETS HAVE A FEATS OF OUR LIVES. JOIN ME AND EAT WITH ME. LETS EAT BIG. WE WILL EAT THEM ALL UP. Eat them like we eat snacks and are still hungry for more. They may see this as a dog fight and get full. But we see this as our meal for fun.

Recently I’ve seen a LOT of folks in the comments talking about which stock should be pumped next. You’d have to be beyond retarded to think it’s a coincidence that this is happening at the same time WSB is experiencing a massive influx of new investors. 

So for the new guys: Contrary to what recent events may lead many to believe this sub is not for pumping and/or dumping unless we’re talking about our respective wives and boyfriends. Go back even just a month and you’ll see, among other things, detailed discussions about the pros and cons of various stocks. You’ll even find some of the catalyst GME DDs that fully explain the logic behind the investment on a fundamental level (I encourage you to read those so you understand the mechanisms behind why we’re at where we’re at). What you WON’T find is the single mob mentality currently propelling GME into the stratosphere. This is important to note because...

A lot of you are already or will soon be looking for your next fix. It doesn’t exist. This is likely a once in a lifetime event. That’s not to say that there aren’t solid gains to be found here, but they aren’t found by banding together to pump a stock for no reason beyond it being the next mob mentality pick. In fact trying to pump a stock as a group is a terrible idea for two main reasons: 

1. It’s way more legally dubious than what’s happening with GME and if we’re too flagrant about it it could potentially get people in trouble and/or trigger restrictive legislative action. We’ve seen many many times before that the financial bodies of this country LOVE to go after the little guys, so don’t give them justification. 

2. GME is a special case where a very autistic person tipped off retail investors to a very retarded move by a hedge fund. Normally retail investors don’t have an advantage over the big boys. If you try to attack them or play them or game the system you’re more than likely going to get stomped into the dirt. 

As you start to consider beyond GME and into the future please first take the time to look back at some posts from months/years past to get a better idea of what WSB is when we aren’t crushing shitrons balls. If this sub turns into a pump and dump forum it’ll be shut down, which would be sad :’(

As a still inexperienced retard myself I PROMISE you the best way you can help this sub and yourself is to sit down, shut up, read DDs from people much more autistic than yourself, and gain knowledge so that one day you can be the autist rather than the retard.

Mods I know you’ve more than got your hands full rn, but I think it could be smart to at least temporarily ban anyone who talks about pumping a stock in order to protect this sub from entities that would use that as evidence to shut WSB down.

Some major brokerage houses have begun to respond to a frenetic surge in the price of shares of companies that has been attributed to rabid buying by individual investors on social-media platforms.

On Wednesday, TD Ameritrade said it was restricting trading for GameStop(GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings(AMC), as well as other names, amid a triple-digit percentage surge in the price of those companies in recent days.

""In the interest of mitigating risk for our company and clients, we have put in place several restrictions on some transactions in $GME, $AMC and other securities,"" a spokeswoman for TD Ameritrade told MarketWatch, referring to the ticker symbols of the companies.

""We made these decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors,"" she said.

Charles Schwab, which bought TD Ameritrade but is still operating as an independent retail brokerage platform, said that it has tightened margin requirements in some of those trading names, including GameStop.

A Schwab spokeswoman said that the platform changed its margin requirements, or how much an investor can borrow, on Jan. 13 and said it has placed ""restrictions in place on certain transactions in GME and other securities.""

The restrictive moves come as shares of videogame retailer GameStock have shot up 1,600% in January, as traders gathered in online chat forums to take large bets on the stock using options, often out-of-the-money calls that pay off only if the stock rises in value over a set period.

Traders on sites like Reddit's WallStreetBets, and using trading platforms like Robinhood, have clashed with hedge- fund investors, sparking a battle between prominent Wall Street short sellers and individual investors in GameStop shares.

A Robinhood spokeswoman said that officials at the popular trading platform ""continuously monitor the markets and adjust as we feel necessary for the benefit of our customers.""

Robinhood said it also moved raised requirements for GME and AMC to 100%, emphasizing that Robinhood doesn't allow shorting of equities or allow customers to trade naked options.

However, the recent run-up in GameStop has been spilling over into other areas of the market, with shares of companies like AMC Entertainment also surging in price on Wednesday, along with shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)and retailer Express Inc. (EXPR). whose shares were up 250%.

For all of you retards who did  exactly what you were told to do in life and still got financially  fucked by these clowns, THIS IS FOR YOU. We'll get you your fair share.  We'll make this right where these rich fucks won't.

I  just put another 100k in at the top. Don't let them stop you at the  brokerages. Get around them. Keep finding ways to buy. They can't stop  us from investing just because it's now against their best interests.  They were perfectly content siphoning off of us after 2008. They didn't  want to regulate after that shitshow, so fuck 'em!

They're trying to push out the settle dates so the stock doesn't look like it's going up to try to slow the momentum. **DO NOT FALL FOR IT. It's still going up but they're hiding it by pushing out the settle dates hoping that we slow our momentum.**

We'll get you there together. Never give up, NEVER SURRENDER. Don't let them trick you at the brokerages.

&#x200B;

Edit: here's proof of their settle date foolery. it wasn't doing this yesterday! Taking my money and buying the stock **BUT NOT SHOWING IT IN THE MARKET. Fuck these guys keep buying!**

Exit strategy is important, so listen very closely and do exactly what I say.

Do not ever sell GME.If you sell, the price will go down.. like maybe even all the way down to 300.

Instead - hold it forever, and use it as collateral for margin. You can make WAY more money using all that margin, and have a nice steady income to get tendies any time you want.

&#x200B;

This is not financial advice, idk what I'm doing.

&#x200B;

Don't sell GME - if you sell, they win - that means you lose.

That little $100 boost is going to make sure my family has enough to eat after rent is paid.

We are seeing an influx of users attempting to promote a stock without posting their positions, due diligence, or anything to verify their play.  


I believe this rule should apply to comments as well.  


Mods, if you need assistance writing a bot that can detect a position screenshot let me know.

https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2021/01/22/margin-debt-and-the-market-up-7-7-in-december-another-record-high

With the GME short squeeze causing billion dollar losses for firms, they will have to liquidate positions to cover their margin calls. This could cause a market drop and further selling to cover margin loss as we spiral into a selling cycle. 

If we see further dropping of the S&P I think it’s time to commit.

This is pure speculation but I think it’s possible. 

Edit: spy is falling and VXX ripping. The White House is monitoring GME now. There has to be market risk involved at this point. 

Edit 2: up 80% on the position, guessing when puts expire on Friday and there is forced short selling on GME and other small caps we will see a further decline.

So far, the following have worked out quite well (in order):

1. AMC  - Bought at around $5 (currently at around 17)
2. NOK - Also bought at around $5 (currently at around 7.5)
3. HIBB - Bought at 53 (currently at around 55.5)
4. BB - Bought at \~20 (Currently at 27)
5. NAKD: Bought at \~0.6 (currently at around 0.9)
6. EXPR: Bought at \~6 (currently at 10)

**Just bought 5000 SNDL stocks at 60 cents,** just based on a random unverified tweet that said it's among the top traded stocks today. Cheap stock, given the past trends, I don't think there's too much downside. Who knows if it gets pulled into the current trend and goes to double digits. Every dollar gained will mean $5K profit (I am not a seasoned investor, so just random logics)

Other longer term bets: Twtr, GM, Uber (currently losing), Salesforce (bought at 220), CPLP, Zoom, SCU

I do believe Nokia and BB can bounce back as businesses too, the rest I've invested mostly based on the chatter. AMC turned out to be a good decision. High hopes on NAKD and EXPR because I've bought a decent amount (by my own standards).

Any other stocks would you recommend, or any of the above you'd recommend exiting?

I'm asking us to stay united on these 2 fronts. DO NOT SELL ANY OF THEM. Simply buy more GME and BB. Do not let the bots divide us. We can work together and make big profits. The plan has always been GME -> BB.

Disproportionately selling any one of these 2 can cause one of the shares to suddenly collapse and can lead to an influx in the other one. This can lead to a lot of innocent WSBers losing out on gains during the pandemic. We need this rise to be stable. If you want to buy either of these shares, DO NOT SELL THE OTHER ONE.

Smoking only reduced 2-3% versus an estimated 4-6% for 2020, and there was a large increase in smokeless tobacco products, specifically oral tobacco non-vaporizer. They also have a large holding in canopy which is going to be pushed in their forward looking guidance due to current administration. 

Premiums are cheap for very small increases. I only have about $500 in the 2/5 $43c but I think this might be an under looked quick earnings play.

I am not a great financial analyst but if you look at what happened with and Tilary, I believe we are just in the initial phases. Mervin and Citron might be two common names but there are several others fund short on the stock.

Retail, as well as a desire to milk other short stocks, might have accelerated the process. But it took almost 2 months (mid Aug - mid Oct)  for TLRY to rise and shorts were paying an interest of 500-600% at one time. Even with dilution as rightly pointed out by someone in another post we have a chance of significant upside if insiders do not sell. Ultimately, I believe there are other players (big funds) in the field who will also try to make money at the expense of the shorts... we are small fish but everyone's appetite is different

TLDR: I think this just a beginning; there will be multiple gamma and short squeeze. To us, it looks like big numbers but maybe it is not for people making trillions and billion over so many years.

Moleculin Biotech is a great opportunity to get a good return on investment. They are currently developing a solution against coronavirus which inhibited coronavirus replication by 100% in vitro. They are waiting for in-vivo results and when they report results the stock will surge. Moreover their lead compound is called Annamycin who is tested right now against AML in a phase 3 clinical trial to be a replacement for the current standard of care for that disease. They have more others under development. The most attractive thing is the price only $1 at 60 mil market cap. This is nothing and presents a huge opportunity to make a lot of money when the covid results are out. At least $10 with covid results out plus other great medicines!|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163947.csv|StockTicker|['WALL', 'TREET', 'GREAT', 'EWARD']|[]|['AML']|[]

At this point with the spreads so wide and MM Fuckery, ive lost like 50 bucks on the trade even though im DEEP Itm and the short calls are essentially ATM. There anyway to realize a nice gain on this other than waiting til june, or did i fuck up by not using FDs.

I get that options are calibrating a pullback but you'd think an 1100 ITM spread would be worth more than $100 and change ea.

Have had a few nice trades with my shares and now back in with $10k. The remaining $5k is waiting to be deployed at a lower price under 220 that will hopefully hit on Thursday before the rally I expect to see on Friday.

Pull money out of the bank. It's not like the interest they scrape off helps anyways, bit our deposits make them unbelievable sums. Hold some funds in metals and take the rest to a respectable local credit union. Imagine millions of withdrawals happening simultaneously. Bleeding the banks dry and causing a financial collapse. 

For many of us trading is the difference between being a wage slave and opportunity, the only true opportunity. Why should I wait for a 401k to return 10% this year when I do more than that weekly. Sure some of us will lose funds bit we accept that possibility. Hell I took a 18% hit just a few weeks ago. Believe me no SEC came to my rescue trying to ""protect me,"" and I'm okay with that.

But now they now see us earning while the old establishment is losing, so they will try to take this from us.

I read lots of good news on GM in the past 2-3 months and watched a video interview from 2019 with  Steve Eisman  (Big Short) who praises the company for very positive future outlook etc.. In a nutshell if GM does good job (and its team seems to be doing great) essentially it can become a major player in pushing forward the EV revolution ( 30 models by 2025 by their words). They've also teamed with Honda (and few other famous companies lately), which by my standards it probably the most reliable cars on the market. Anyway do you think that GM could skyrocket as Tesla in the next 3-5 years? 

Just a 35 yr old engineer looking into value investing

Be Safe!

Our February Goal should be to get Gamestop and AMC above the $2.4 trillion market cap of Apple. Once we take out the short sellers, our next momentum driver will be forcing the formulaic indices to add Gamestop and AMC and drive them to the moon!

If we can get Gamestop up to $2.5 trillion market cap, there is still a 119x fold increase to be had. So your $10,000 investment will be worth $1,190,000. As for doing the same thing to AMC, that would be a 416x fold increase so a $10,000 investment will grow to $4,160,000. Still, Gamestop will always be my favorite tendie.

I am a man of the people; I have 14,000 Karma and have been active on this sub for well over 1 year. 

\*\* BEGIN BIG DICK DILIGENCE\*\*

This is prime buying szn for Castor Maritime and I would absolutely hate to miss the next goddamn 🚀 to paying off my mounting law school debt. For this reason, I’m going long on 20,000 shares to start. This summer, I’m looking to sink another 40,000 shares in them. 2021 is going to be a big year for maritime shipping.

Why is it a good buy, you might ask? Let me fucking tell you. The maritime shipping industry hemorrhaged during COVID and lost 4.1%. It is on track for at least a 4% gain industry-wide this year. The industry itself is gearing to boom. Freight prices are increasing and importers have signaled their willingness to pay the increased rate. CTRM is going to have unprecedented growth in the next two quarters as a result.

With Biden’s clean energy agenda coming down the pike, reformation of transportation emissions guidelines are to be expected. CTRM operates six dry bulk carriers with one capsize carrier being acquired just last week. The dry bulk carriers are among the lowest carbon-emitting vessels available for maritime transport.  CTRM is already positioned well for this environmental leap.

It’s also stupid fucking cheap at $.45 per share. Most analysts with more than feces in their skull will see the $3+ one year target potential organically. If WSB gets behind them, anything is possible. Look at the lucky fuckers who got in at $.19 a few months ago. I bet life sucks from their sheep's wool jump seat window in their Gulfstream G650.

As in, whenever a huge upswing in GME occurs and trips a circuit breaker, the NASDAQ dips significantly?

I have been in and out of GME (currently have 35 shares, plus two call options totaling about $35k) but it is clear to me that as hedge funds move to cover the shorts they have laid, they are liquidating other assets, including their holdings in stalwarts like AMZN, AAPL, GOOGL, and the like. Just something to keep in mind if you are playing both GME AND FAANG earnings. Until the squeeze fully plays out, we can expect occasional sell-offs of the FAANGs and others that might impact the rest of your portfolio, assuming it isn't just GME.

&#x200B;

Considering the fact that you are in French Revolution mode, would you consider starting shorts in a wrecked journalistic outlet from the Spanish extreme left? It's name is [PRISA](https://www.investing.com/equities/prisa-financial-summary) (""Promotora de Informaciones, S.A.) (Investor Relations [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=PRISA+INVESTOR+RELATIONS&rlz=1C1CHBD_esES860ES860&oq=PRISA+INVESTOR+RELATIONS&aqs=chrome..69i57.3295j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8))

&#x200B;

Points:

\-FINANCIALS: it's an absolute ruin of business, it only survives thanaks to the fact that Spanish banks have become shareholders. Check their financials [here](https://www.investing.com/equities/prisa-financial-summary)

&#x200B;

\-[SHAREHOLDERS](http://www.cnmv.es/Portal/Consultas/DerechosVoto/Notificaciones-Participaciones.aspx?qS={c63f29c7-4140-4e6c-b4ef-e4b4d3547688}): most are former creditors (mostly Spanish banks\*) or corporate investors caught in past investments made at the heat of the financial and real estate bubble that Spain experienced a decade ago. 

So it's not very likely that they will expand their positions to safeguard the share price. The [news](https://www.vozpopuli.com/medios/amber-elpais-cadenaser-prisa_0_1411359754.html) highlighting their intentions to want to get out of PRISA are common. In fact if you google PRISA + X shareholders you will find a handful of news about each of them.

There is also a Qatari sheikh linked to corruption in Spanish football,  International Media Group (Al Jazeera Dubai Media and CNBC) and a couple of British hedge funds. 

&#x200B;

\-VOLUME: guys, it's a microcap from a small country like Spain... There are days when it has a volumen less than €50.000...

&#x200B;

P.S. vol\_I Those same Spanish banks are known (and hated) here for having carried out an aggressive and cruel policy of evictions on unemployed people who could not pay their mortgages when the financial and real estate crisis broke out

P.S. vol\_II Spanish governemnt/bank subsidied media conglomerate hates you american guys. They have spent the last four years making documentaries about how stupid you were because of your political vicissitudes."|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163920.csv|StockTicker|['SHORT', 'PRISA', 'STOCK', 'A']|['A']|['S', 'A', 'PRISA', 'PRISA', 'X', 'P', 'S', 'I', 'P', 'S', 'II']|['S', 'A', 'X', 'P', 'S', 'P', 'S']

My fam moved to a new city for my dad's job and 6 months later (after they bought a new condo) he was laid off. His company blamed the flu but the CEO got a 300k bonus.

I threw my life savings into this yesterday and thankfully I can help my parents for a few months till they can sell their condo and move in with me. I bought at a 114$ and I am up 20k and sold at 330$. I told my parents that we should be ok for sometime and my fellow autists - there is nothing like seeing your parents say thank you with tears in their eyes.

I haven't been the best son to them but you guys help reduce some of the guilt I carry for being a crappy son to great parents.

They have to find a way to regulate that so that big money can rig the markets again, and they seem to be pretending that they are losing control.

Yet several big funds are not writing options are are buying in the order the options are made. What I mean by that is the last 5 jumps the GME stock has jumped to or right next to the highest available option available. Nobody rights far enough, yet for other stocks that have shot up people are pushing out more otm option.

Something is fishy.

I bet if someone wrote a $500 option or higher the patters would continue and GME would jump to those numbers, because it seems like there's some kind of game being played. I think they are taking retail for the fool.

I have been thanked by people who followed me and incidentally, that post was also how I got my flair.

The other day, one of my students brought to my attention a potential opportunity in SHAK. I’ve thought a lot about it and I’m increasingly believing in his convictions. Here are some facts:

1. From 2015 to now, the annual geometric return of SHAK was only about 10%/year. Over that same period, their sales/share has been growing at over 20%/year. The most recent quarter’s report implies a sales/share of 26% in the last year. I believe the market is slow to realize a lot of idiosyncratic factors when we have large macro events like the pandemic going on. 

2. Bright short-term outlook. Vaccine rates are going up. California lifted its stay-at-home order and allowed for outdoor dining. Hospitalization and Covid rates are going down. 

3. Have you ever had their fucking burgers? If you don’t like their burgers, you aren’t human. There was a line going around the store for pickup only when I went and it was similar to the iPhone craze when they were first released.

With what has happened the past week I have been brainstorming ways we can turn this into long-term change in the finance field. Last night I read a tweet from the one and only Chamath Palihapitiya in which he states that there was some interest in investing in a small disruptive Fund where 100 autists would be selected to trade 100k each. At first, I really liked the raw idea, but then I started thinking about what makes r/wsb a disruptive force in the financial world. I came to the conclusion that wsb has always been successful because of our numbers. We crowdsource our research through DD posts and release it to the masses. What makes us a force to be reckoned with is the fact that all 2.6 million members have instant access to this research that historically has been blocked by ridiculous paywalls and obscured by complex lingo to deter the average person. After thinking back on this I felt that giving 100k to 100 individuals would not accurately represent the reason we are successful. I do believe these 100 people would certainly be successful, however, our growing community will fail to be represented. Surprisingly, under all of the memes and names, this community is one of the biggest supporters of groundbreaking tech. We collectively agree not to value companies like TESLA based on boomer fundamentals, instead, we create value through how a company or CEO can change the world. Think about it, without all of us, TSLA would be unable to break through the ceiling of old school hedge funds shorts. Giving 100 individuals money to trade would not accurately transfer our power and influence to a legitimate fund and therefore be unable to disrupt the financial sector in a meaningful way.

&#x200B;

**Thesis**

In my opinion, the only way we can forge our path into the future is through organizing and crowdsourcing our wealth of knowledge into a fund and allow all long-term wsb users (think one year of activity) vote on how invested money should be allocated based on  DD posts. The DD posts that would be voted on would be selected directly off of wsb by a small group of selected, popular, individuals (i.e u/DeepFuckingValue). We would be seen by most as a young group of investors changing the way the average person invests. It should go without saying that all of our trades would be posted along with the DD to support the trade by the startup. This gives the average autist an organized place to view and learn about high-level trades that are deemed reputable by intelligent site regulars.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Honestly, this idea was just a brainstorming project for me. I'm only a college student, so even though I think I know everything, the reality is, I don't. I'm not sure if this idea will be feasible or if it's even legal according to SEC regulations. If it is against SEC law I would love to hear ways we could transform the idea to comply. My main goal is to have this foster future discussion on the future of wsb and finance. As a history buff, I know that democracy is the product of human innovation and I see a democratic hedge fund as the natural progression of the financial world.

**Note From OP**

Might end up being a dogshit idea, if you think it is, roast me in the comments, please. Just also add why it's a bad idea to foster discussion. Thanks!"|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163944.csv|StockTicker|['A']|['A']|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'TESLA', 'CEO', 'TSLA', 'DD', 'DD', 'DD', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['DD', 'CEO', 'TSLA', 'DD', 'DD', 'DD']

What a time to be alive. 

 *""Bulls make money, bears make money,* ***pigs get slaughtered****""* 

How ironic, that one of the most iconic sayings in investing, was coined by Wall Street itself. Right now, pigs are getting slaughtered, and crying for someone to blame.

**I want you guys to really think about this:**

Every investment you make, comes with inherit risks and rewards. These hedge funds, who shorted 130%+ of the GME float, took a MASSIVE FUCKING RISK. They beat this stock down to a pulp, and instead of taking out their profits (like bears), they got greedy (like fucking pigs) and continued to increase their short.

They are literally affecting peoples lives. Those who work at Gamestop. They wanted this to go completely bankrupt. Oh, and who's going to bail out the average joe? Who bails out Jim, who works behind the counter at Gamestop?

NO ONE.

But who bails out these hedge funds? Fucking think about it. Melvin Capital gets a 3bn bailout, because they took a HUGE FUCKING RISK, and got caught on the losing end. 

Also, lets talk about risk for a second.

These hedge fund and institutions took a big risk that didnt pan out. Okay, not a big deal. they can just take the L and move on. But no. They doubled down, and you get articles now BLAMING THE RETAIL INVESTOR FOR MANIPULATION. 

So let me ask you this:

1. they took a huge risk on a bet
2. they are losing the bet
3. instead of being on the receiving end of the loss, they blame others for the situation that they're in

If you take a huge risk, and you KNOW that there is a chance of a loss, and that loss occurs, the only reason why you would start blaming others and finding excuses, is because there is an inherit FLAW in the system.

Melvin and other shorts knew, that there was no way something like this could happen. Why? Because they have the instruments to manipulate you and your emotions, through BS articles, analysts, and mass media.

TLDR:

1. Shorts shorted 130%, took a huge risk and lost
2. instead of taking the L, they're blaming YOU for manipulating the market"|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163910.csv|StockTicker|['GME', 'GTFO']|['GME']|['I', 'GME', 'SSIVE', 'CKING', 'RISK', 'NO', 'ONE', 'HUGE', 'CKING', 'RISK', 'L', 'AMING', 'THE', 'ETAIL', 'ESTOR', 'FOR', 'ATION', 'KNOW', 'FLAW', 'BS', 'L', 'YOU']|['GME', 'ONE', 'L', 'FOR', 'L']

Additionally, all the news sites are listing GME and AMC not BB which is by far the bigger move on this sub.

My argument is, why not!

This is clearly either a stupid attempt to divert energy away from GME or an attempt to rapidly make money by raising the price. That being said, DON'T SELL YOUR GME. I'll repeat for those in the back.

**🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 DONT SELL YOUR GME Until at least Friday 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Please wait until the hedge fund lads are forced to buy your shares for whatever you offer them up for.

But not everyone is balls deep in GME right now and for good reason. The risk/price ratio is getting a bit lean. While I have NO DOUBT GME will likely continue up, I think more money is to be made elsewhere.

What we know about AMC:

\-Someone is desperately trying to increase the price

\-Its 69% shorted (I mean COMEEEE ON that's nice) **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Will there be a short squeeze like GME - meh...

But there will be upwards movement if the funds have to cover, it will not be the near guaranteed Mars mission of GME but we might have a moonshot here **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Im expecting It to hit about 25ish to be honest but there's still good money to be made. Dont sell shit until Friday lads. Set a stop loss so we dont get played like fools.

I hope I used enough rockets to convince everyone. Tell your wife to start cuddling her boyfriend because shits about to get real in the market this week.

I sold GME at 37, i'm not salty (yes I am) and have none left

I have a small amount of shares in AMC <1k might get more (options are too damn high right now)

It won’t work. Let me explain why. 

I grew up poor. I grew up on the poor side of town. I remember my parents struggling with money for years. Shitty cars. Shitty clothes. Never owned any video game consoles because not only did my parents not approve of them, they couldn’t afford them. Ramen was a staple at home. I still eat it to this day. Pro tip you can have for the future - a slice of cheese and a whisked egg in your ramen make it way better than just with seasoning alone. 

I’ve been broke almost my entire life. I’ve never had more than $9,000 liquid at one time. I’ve been nearly homeless too many times to count. I’m an expert at thrift store shopping. I’ve worked 50, 60, 70, 80, even 90 hour weeks at shit jobs since I started working at 18. I’ve never stolen. My parents raised me to be honest and a good person and a hard worker and that’s just who I am. 

I have struggled and have always dealt with debt and I have lived basically paycheck to paycheck for my entire adult life. 

**If you think the prospect of losing the few hundred dollars I have in GME is going to scare me into selling before Friday, you couldn’t be more wrong.**

When you only ever average like $1,000 in your checking account, what’s the difference when it’s $100 or $10? Do you have any idea how many times I’ve been there before? You know what I do when I’m completely fucking broke? I literally shrug my shoulders and play some video games or music until my next paycheck. And I’ll do it again. I’m not here to get rich overnight. I don’t have enough to invest to make that happen. I’m here to say fuck you and to be a part of this moment, this movement. I will never sell. Never. I don’t even care about the money at this point. If I never see it again it makes no difference to me. I have to go right back to work tomorrow and the next day and next week and next month and next year. 

There isn’t a single thing you can say or do to change my position. I risk my money happily. I am not the least bit scared or worried. You might be a financial expert, I am a survival master. 

Power to the people. 

I will not sell."|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163907.csv|StockTicker|['A']|['A']|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']|['GME']

The media is the problem with these stocks going parabolical...

$GME was a technicality that occurred because the SEC sucks out their job. They would be fired at any normal business because they were too busy jerking off in the copy room to actually investigate any of the hedge funds. Therefore, hedge funds run rampant in the market making retarded trades like.... a 140%+ SHORT ON GAMESTOP!

Gamestop wasn't dead but was dying. We all knew it had a chance to turn it around and needed Cohen and u/DeepFuckingValue and his amazing DD helped show us this. Therefore, folks started to see some value, then Cohen rumblings, THEN we caught the retards red-handed and went for the almighty, all mega short squeeze that would make your grandma wet again.

Anywho.. I digress. $GME was running with just the original sub and for the most part, it was just $GME. Then the hedge funds cried to mom and dad which resulted in crazy media coverage and then it brought out Daddy Chamath and Papa Musk (bless thee) NOW!!! Look at the market and all of the people on here. We have companies skyrocketing on THE HOPES for a short squeeze that in most cases don't exist (Honestly, I haven't checked). Additionally, they've caused additional autists to pile into $GME like clowns into a car. The end result will be more bagholders..

So media if you're reading this...  
1) Quit being stupid and get your facts straight... we're pushing for the short squeeze not just randomly driving up the price because we're bored  
2) Stop talking about it if you don't want more people to do it.... dumbasses.  
3) AGAIN! Stop talking about it... we don't want these retards in our sub. Take me back!!!

With AI tech growing and expanding Big Data business company started to invest in AI technologies and in 2018 acquired Silicon Valley IT solutions company [Cornerstone](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/09/25/1575568/0/en/Sonasoft-Corp-Announces-Completion-of-Cornerstone-Technologies-Acquisition-and-Discusses-eDiscovery-and-Artificial-Intelligence.html) and and [AI company Hotify](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/09/25/1575568/0/en/Sonasoft-Corp-Announces-Completion-of-Cornerstone-Technologies-Acquisition-and-Discusses-eDiscovery-and-Artificial-Intelligence.html) thus became an A to Z, IT, Big Data, AI company offering a unique expertise.

**Last reported financials 09/30/2020** (click on Quarterly) [SSFT - Sonasoft Corp. | Financials | OTC Markets](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SSFT/financials)

On December 30th 2020, company released a year in review PR outlining these developments. You **MUST** read it.

[Sonasoft 2020 Year in Review | SSFT - Sonasoft Corp. | News | OTC Markets](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SSFT/news/Sonasoft-2020-Year-in-Review?id=284772)

One thing i'd like to point out in the release is this part;

>2020 saw Sonasoft sign some key strategic partnerships. The biggest of these will see Sonasoft building AI bots for one of the world’s largest financial services companies. This will place AI analytics at the very center of the financial data ecosystem.

Guess who is one of that largest financial services company.  
**$FIS Fidelity Investment Services.** An 80 billion USD financial services behemoth.

And in june they dropped the biggest bomb that was completely overlooked.

FFING streaming revenues from **Fidelity and Google!!!** Could there be a better reference for an AI company?

Furthermore, Sonasoft owns important IPs related to Artificial Intelligence that are either patented or patent pending, those alone are this company's biggest asset for the future.Also in 2019 company created a new management team along with the new direction. Co-founder Mike Khanna(and I assume Andy's son) became the new CEO representing the new generational direction.

Fuck you.

Now, that said - even the most retarded of us has some glimmer of the concept of ""paying taxes.""  That's a good start.

Now, make sure you're eating from the bottle of unexpired Ritalin or Adderall before continuing.

&#x200B;

For those retards that  have gotten their booger-encrusted fingers on an absolute mountain of fuckloads of tendie-coupons, you may need to file a 13H.

[https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2011/2011-154.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2011/2011-154.htm)

[https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/large-trader-faqs.htm](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/large-trader-faqs.htm)

Here are some of the simpler big words that your wife's boyfriend might be able to read to you that might not confuse you too much:

""Traders who engage in a substantial level of trading activity will be  required to identify themselves to the SEC by filing a form, Form 13H,  with the Commission. A 'large trader' will be defined as a person whose  transactions in exchange-listed securities equal or exceed:

1. During a calendar day, either two million shares or shares with a fair market value of $20 million; or
2. During a calendar month, either twenty million shares or shares with a fair market value of $200 million.""

It's much more complicated than this, but this is a starting point.

Get your mom or your wife's boyfriend to find you a good tax consultant who can either help you with the above as well as all the other boring shit you'll now have to do, or point you in the right direction of a person who can.

Or, read the links above, and do it yourself.  Maybe you won't fuck it up too much, and will only lose all of your gains and spend just a minimal time in prison giving blowjobs in the boiler room.

&#x200B;

Finally, related - using your best indoor voice, go over to [https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/) and politely explain to the adults in there your situation, and ask them for some advice.  They tend to be very, very nice, probably won't take all your new tendies, and won't yell at you.  Much.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

1. **Don't spam stocks.** People love to find undervalued/overvalued stocks but spamming them is not going to do shit. Instead, do a well-researched opinion document and post it online so people can discuss/check what YOU saw that made the stock valuable in the first place.
2. **We are not a pump and dump**. For the past days, r/wallstreetbets has been painted as a pump and dump group which explicitly is forbidden in this subreddit. These past days mods have been working tirelessly to remove all content that violate the subreddit rules.
3. **We are not an educational center**. We get it-you're new and don't know where to start, but creating a thread asking for help is not the way. If threads asking for basic understanding were allowed this subreddit would be clogged with questions. You can easily google all your questions, and watch countless YouTube tutorials to learn.

Most people short GME are from professional institutions. Melvin Capital most obviously.

What they can do is buy themselves time. That's what happened Monday with the 2B received from Point72 and Citadel. This cash influx acts as collateral for the brokers that have lent them the shares to short. It also is used to cover their borrowing fees. These fees are calculated daily based on a percentage of their total borrowed shares and the underlying principle. That 2B only lasted them about four hours due to the price spiking.

At $175.00, Melvin is essentially insolvent. The only reason covering and the squeeze hasn't occurred yet is because through various theories or unpublicized new cash access they've convinced lenders the price cannot or will not remain at these levels. We simply need to hold our positions until Melvin cannot afford their borrow prices, or the brokers and MMs call it start covering for them. I'm guessing Friday afternoon is that time.

This isn't to say price isn't important, it is. However HOLDING THE FUCKING LINE is crucial.

This also doesn't even account for the stupid illiquidity and tiny float:borrow ratio on the stock.

TLDR; Don't fucking sell."|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163912.csv|StockTicker|[]|[]|['GME', 'B', 'B', 'LDING', 'THE', 'CKING', 'LINE']|['GME', 'B', 'B', 'LINE']

We know Tesla is the best Large Cap Company. They have the cars. They have the electricity. They gave us hope before and during the VID hit. I like this stock.

When I like two stocks, I like them. And I like them a lot. So I want them to join together.

Elon is a rich man. In fact, if my calculations are correct, he is very rich. Rich enough to buy gamestonk outright. So while this squeeze is going down he should hop in, fuck the shorts on the way up, and take majority shareholder ownership at the same time. 

* Once he has ownership, he can use gamestop locations as Tesla showrooms, complete with charging stations, cafes, and game rooms. He sell games. Tesla game exclusives. Good games, as a matter of fact. How about a game system rivaling the PS4? A Tesla Game system exclusive to Tesla showrooms and Tesla cars?

Bought a Tesla? Get gamestonk the more data you help provide to their AI. Have Tesla stock or Gamestonks? Save on Gamestonk exclusive meme merchandise. This is a no brainer and I hope we can garner his support.

> Newspapers bearing the alarm headlines: *Racketeers Are Taking Over Banks* are particularly amusing in view af the fact that the conspirators, the top rank racketeers, took over our entire financial and banking system more than half a century ago through their “Federal” Reserve fraud. Operating within the laws that they dictate, or in contempt of the law, through their agents, they steadily victimize the nation through brigandage and racketeering.” (p.180)

And to an extent, they are right. Imagine a year from now, this level of memes and money is impossible to maintain. But they forgot one thing. We are an army of retards and GME is the short bus. Bring it to 5k, once is pulls back, we hop right back on this roller coaster. This is a low float stock we have already proven can go ballistic. There is no reason we can’t do this again and again, and once they realize that this isn’t a one time thing, that GME is the special Olympic stadium for the retards here, they will be forced to cover in mass, they can hold and double down for a week, they can’t for 6 months. Their original thesis was it was going bankrupt, they were wrong. They’re new short thesis is that the hype will die.

I’m here to clear the air on why that isn’t the case. 

The key difference between the two is the short positions. Whilst it’s true that AMC also has a large short interest it is nothing compared to GME. 

What separates GME is the percentage of shorts against the float which is approximately 130%-140%. This meant that short sellers had no where to go when things started to go south for them (I will explain why later).

AMC has a large short interest however it’s approximately 70%, which gives the short sellers a large position to exit (which given the hype surrounding GME is very likely after today). 

Why does this difference matter?

Well with GME, the short sellers have already borrowed shares and are required to buy back those shares at market value when one of the following triggers activates:-

1. They close their position
2. Their margin gets called and they are forced to
3. Their short positions expire

When a trigger activates the amount of shares they borrowed is then purchased at market rate. If the shares aren’t available then price goes up (rapidly) trading is suspended (usually) and this gives time for investors to set a sell price. Rinse and repeat until all shares owed are paid back. 

With GME having more than 100% short interest this means that stock is going to have to change hands numerous times to pay back the investors. During this period the stock price will be huge and there will be many trading stops. All of the money for this price increase will be coming from the short sellers and htere can be no bag holders (unless you really are retarded) because the stock is being returned to the original investor and they were paid interest by the short sellers anyway so they can’t complain. 


With AMC, there is a large window for short sellers to exit and therefore cannot be squeezed as hard. Smart short sellers will be closing their positions today or after today causing a pump (because they are buying shares to close their positions). The recirculated GME hype investment will also cause a pump and with no end game squeeze in sight the stock will be left floating in a bubble. Which will eventually pop leaving many retail investors as bag holders. 

You cannot squeeze every short position in the market. GME is special because the institutions taunted us and exposed themselves by being reckless. It won’t happen again. You aren’t squeezing anyone but yourselves in AMC. Be at your own risk. 

TLDR: GME squeeze is real, AMC squeeze is fictional."|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163912.csv|StockTicker|['AMC', 'GME']|['AMC', 'GME']|['A', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'AMC']|['A', 'AMC', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'GME', 'AMC']

So IF WE REMAIN OVER $200, then shorts will be forced to close all of these within the next few days. They will need to obtain over 15 MILLION SHARES for this to happen.

2.

THESE ARE FUDDERS TRYING TO GET IN CHEAPER OR EXIT POSITIONS. THE HYPE IS REAL**

Nokia is now a market leader in networking and enterprise level technology, essentially providing infrastructure for all types of networks. They also manufacture telecommunications equipment and engage in licensing. The most exciting opportunity in their current business model is 5G, which could be the main catalyst for this seemingly boring stock to finally break through resistance and become a valuable asset in portfolios. I'll give some key updates and price targets below. 


Partnerships and beneficiary of 5G rollouts


For starters, it's been a common thesis that 5G will be the greatest investing opportunity of the decade, yet Nokia remains in a flat/downward pattern on the chart. They've recently earned several contracts that will give them a stronger moat in the 5G domain as well as steady revenues and growth opportunities. Recent contracts come from a very diverse group of partners, including: 

-A 5 year deal with T-Mobile, in which T-Mobile will power it's 2.5GHz mid-band spectrum using Nokia's AirScale Radio platform. In addition, Nokia will facilitate T-Mobile to upgrade it's mid-band LTE network to a 5G network. 

-Secured a government contract via the National Cybersecurity Center for Excellence. Nokia was selected as the tech provider and collaborator for the 5G Cybersecurity Project. The federal agency plans to utilize Nokia's technology for the transition to 5G from 4G. The project intends to identify 5G use cases to highlight the efficacy of the components of 5G architecture against security threats as part of a government initiative to beef up it's cyber security and anti-spying tools.

-Partnership with Google Cloud in which the 2 firms will work in unison on businesses' digital transformation at the network edge through both 5G connectivity and cloud-native applications and capabilities. The partnership's purpose is to develop solutions for communication service providers to modernize network infrastructure and ensure smooth transitions to cloud-native 5G-core. This will likely build an ecosystem of services that deployable anywhere, from network edge, to public clouds, private clouds, and carrier networks. 

-Nokia has also recently announced partnerships with M1 for 5G solutions in Singarpore, as well as TeleZ to deploy key infrastructure solutions for TeleZ subsribers in Sweden, Lativa, Lithuania, and Estonia. They were also awarded a contract by NASA for $14.1 million to build 4G infrastructure on the moon. 


Nokia has more than 220 large enterprise customers across industries worldwide, of which at least 30 have deployed 5G. They were also in a geopolitical battle in which the U.S. expressed interest in owning a piece of the company, and in response Finland built it's stake in Nokia via Solidium Oy, the state's equity-asset manager, to 1 billion euros($1.2b usd). Nokia also intends to repurchase 500 million shares in the coming months, so demand for the stock is picking up on all levels. 


In addition to infrastructure, licensing is a huge part of Nokia's business model that will benefit from 5G. The ""Nokia Technologies"" Arm handles patent licensing, technology licensing, and brand licensing. This includes an industry-leading patent portfolio including ~20,000 patent families including ~3500 5G standard essential patent families. 


So why is a company with so many valuable assets and recently announced deals/partnerships still trading flat and so seemingly undervalued? The short answer is the former CEO made several bad choices which gave Nokia's competitors an upper hand on the current 5G landscape and put NOK share price in a long term downtrend which has gave it a reputation as a boring stock with an ugly chart. However, with new CEO Pekka Lundmark's expertise in driving returns to shareholders, as well as the scrutiny and subsequent bans of Huawei opening the door for competition, Nokia now has a much needed breath of life and a chance to gain market share to become the biggest beneficiary of the 5G revolution. The new CEO is determined to get Nokia to the top and pull in solid returns to shareholders, as evidenced by the slew of recent contracts/partnerships along with his plans for spending aggressively on R&D, as well as developing a leaner business model by cutting unnecessary expenses and unprofitable endeavors. 


Nokia is primed for growth as they plan into several emerging, high growth markets including 5G, IoT, Edge computing, Network Encryption, Cloud Radio Access, Software Defined Infrastructure(SDI), Cloud Managed LAN, Optical Communications and Networking, as well as established high growth markets such as Smart Wearables, Defense/Security, and LTE. 



Despite the slew of positive news surrounding Nokia and their partnerships/contracts, the stock is still very undervalued, even at today's price surge. 

That may soon change, as the stock's chart is beginning to signal incoming volatility. The implied volatility(IV) and volume for NOK call options are indicating big moves in the coming months. Open interest is on the rise as well. 




NOK is trading at a Price/Book ratio of 1.3x, compared to it's peers average of 4.0x and the sector average 2.2x 

NOK is also undervalued in terms of Price/LTM sales. It has a ratio of 0.9x, it's peers trade at an average of 3.9x, and the sector average of 1.8x

To establish the Fair Value Estimate, we'll use 2 models taking input from previous NOK financials, as well as data from competitors. (Competitors include: CSCO, ERIC, MSI, MSFT, and AAPL.

P/E Multiples: $14.94 target 

Earnings Power Value: $15.64 target 

The average for the 2 models imply a Fair Value Estimate of $15.29 




These estimates are based on historical data, therefore are fair values for the current price and past performance, not taking into account the market share and recurring revenue recently secured. I believe over the 3 months ad beyond the fair value will be much higher as earnings begin to reflect the value and growth from 5G contracts and recurring revenues. 


Even currently, those estimates are a bit low as Nokia's closest competitor, Ericsson, has a market cap that is nearly 70% higher than Nokia, despite the two having very similar financials and even trailing Nokia in several key metrics. 



At NOK's current share price of, it remains undervalued as ERIC is only ahead of NOK in 2 key categories, EBITDA and Profit Margin, and ERIC is only outperforming NOK by a slim margin in these categories. I believe NOK should be valued much higher, than ERIC since they are gaining contracts MUCH faster than ERIC and also Huawei, which would imply a share price of $7.11 before any buybacks place shares into the treasury, which would increase the price even further. 


Nokias Fair value is over $25

This is based on competitor ERIC who is valued 68.4% higher despite having trailing NOK in almost every key metric for valuation, and the valuation of Huawei who is losing tons of revenue and contracts in favor of Nokia"|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163941.csv|StockTicker|['$NOK', 'A']|['NOK', 'A']|['DO', 'NOT', 'ISTEN', 'TO', 'EOPLE', 'AYING', 'NOK', 'HYPE', 'ARE', 'BOTS', 'THESE', 'ARE', 'DDERS', 'RYING', 'TO', 'GET', 'IN', 'EAPER', 'OR', 'EXIT', 'TIONS', 'THE', 'HYPE', 'IS', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'A', 'LTE', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'Z', 'Z', 'NASA', 'G', 'G', 'U', 'S', 'G', 'G', 'CEO', 'G', 'NOK', 'CEO', 'G', 'CEO', 'D', 'G', 'T', 'LAN', 'LTE', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'LTM', 'NOK', 'CSCO', 'ERIC', 'MSI', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'E', 'I', 'G', 'ERIC', 'NOK', 'BITDA', 'ERIC', 'NOK', 'I', 'NOK', 'ERIC', 'MUCH', 'ERIC', 'ERIC', 'NOK']|['DO', 'NOK', 'ARE', 'ARE', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'A', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'Z', 'Z', 'G', 'G', 'S', 'G', 'G', 'CEO', 'G', 'NOK', 'CEO', 'G', 'CEO', 'D', 'G', 'T', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'LTM', 'NOK', 'CSCO', 'ERIC', 'MSI', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'E', 'G', 'ERIC', 'NOK', 'ERIC', 'NOK', 'NOK', 'ERIC', 'ERIC', 'ERIC', 'NOK']

\-The short interest is higher than previous squeezes and INCREASED.

\-The internet and retail gives bulls a massive edge. The media coverage only helps; everyone knows and everyone will get in.

\-Our market is much more volatile, liquid, and bullish than in 2008.

\-The lawsuit against Porsche for the VW squeeze was dismissed even though they were 1 actor that benefitted immensely (rather than just individuals): the precendent is set-- regulators can't do anything about it. The never even did anything to stop/punish Martin Shkreli, everyone's boogieman, from squeezing. Powell just spoke and said ANDROMEDA.

\-Volkswagen became the most valuable company in the world-- to reach this level GME would need go beyond 33,000 a share.

They should have gone bankrupt earlier this week, but instead they [received a $2.75B bailout from two other hedge funds, Point72 and Citadel](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340). **Citadel has a direct financial interest in helping shorters like Melvin Capital by minimizing GME's price increase.**

Back in 2018, [Bloomberg found that Robinhood received almost half of its profits from a process called ""payment-for-order-flow""](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-15/robinhood-gets-almost-half-its-revenue-in-controversial-bargain-with-high-speed-traders) which is when brokers pay Robinhood for the ability to act as a middleman between them and the stock market.

WSB isn’t about market manipulation, pumping stocks, or making gains; it’s about losing money with your friends and being gay with your dad. This is a very unique situation, and the best thing to do is just enjoy it. Fuck all the naysayers who claim WSB will never be the same again- things will be back to normal when normies lose their kid’s college fund and have to move into their wife’s boyfriend’s basement because some retard told them to buy puts on Amazon right before JPow steps down from the fed and Bezos is announced as his successor.

The media will get bored, as they always do, and we will go back to being a zoo. Thank you to the mods for their awesome work this week. If this place ever gets shut down (doubt it), I will immediately join the website that takes its place. This community cannot be replaced. Our shared culture is eternal. The eyes of the media, and even the fucking government, need to just let us be please. I want to see 18 year olds go from 5k to 500k, then back down to 0, and we all get to shout at them. I want to get banned for using one of the 3 c-words. I want auto mod to call me a retard. I want to see charity donations. I just wanna lose some money in peace, throwing it on a dream.

The logic that WSB is an organised community is a retroactive reassembling of the narrative. We have a healthy balance of bears and bulls, and plenty of people who call each other retarded for doing very detailed DD on stocks. Whether or not people agree with the DD or not is on them. 

Memes aside: I like this stock. I want to buy it. I have read the DDs and made an informed, individual decision. Do I want people to sell it? Of course not. I want them to make money. This does not amount to collusion any more than wishing well to a stranger on the street. Lazy media commentators can’t understand the DD? Blame it on a pump. People want to throw a political spin on it? Redistribution of wealth! 

Anyone who has been here more than a week knows that we redistribute our tendies into the pockets of Wall Street. That is it. Now, members of this sub get one win (okay, maybe TSLA could be considered a win too) and there suddenly needs to be a collective effort? No. Individuals made high quality posts, I liked the posts, I bought. Repeat this several times over. 

Any long-timers want to share their favourite historic losses on this sub? To show the media that at the end of the day, again, we are here to lose money gambling on a dream, and support the gay mods.

TLDR: the media suck. None of them are brave enough to break from the current narrative. I like you guys. Our shared memories are great.

One argument that will be made is that it's not fair that we made so much money by recognizing that a group of hedge funds and institutions were in over their heads. It hurts the market and we should feel bad for exploiting them.

The total market cap of $GME is around $12B as I'm writing this. **The total market cap of Wall Street is around $50T.** That means we've currently displaced about .025% of the total value of the US stock market. I will type that out to reiterate: we have displaced approximately one quarter of one tenth of one percent of the total market cap. To claim that we are doing anything which is tremendously harmful to the whole market is absolutely pants-on-fire lies. Is this going to change some elements of the market moving into the future? Almost certainly. But even if this stock goes to $1000 per share, we are still only talking about less than one tenth of one percent of the total market cap that's out there. 

If you're looking at your RH balance right now  and thinking ""wow, that's a lot of money, am I doing something wrong? Illegal, even?"" the answer is **ABSOLUTELY NOT.** What you are beginning to notice is that the wealth gap in this country is absolutely massive. Thousands upon thousands of people could make year changing or life changing money out of this squeeze and it'll hardly be a blip on Wall Street's radar. Greed is absolutely out of control at the top and this funny little news story is tangible proof of that. Do not let them gaslight you into thinking that it's wrong for you to get a slightly larger sliver of the pie. 

Good luck to everyone playing this. I've got 100 shares at a cost basis of $103.95. I might not make millions, but I might be able to make a dent in my student loans, or pay off my car, or something that makes me just a little more hopeful that I'll be able to live some sort of ""American Dream"" before I'm old and wrinkled."|2021-01-27 16:39:03.735317|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_163914.csv|StockTicker|['$GME']|['GME']|['$GME', '$GME', 'B', 'T', 'US', 'I', 'RH', 'I', 'UTELY', 'NOT', 'I', 'I']|['GME', 'GME', 'B', 'T', 'RH']

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g8VPDB6qZA



You heard that right. The Macro Fundamentals are going to shoot GME up. u/DeepFuckingValue is a God and all the other DD is mostly legit, but there’s something no one is talking about: **Money Multipliers.** If you don’t know what it is, it doesn’t matter, but you might as well know why this ship ain’t stopping.

What is a Money Multiplier? Money Makers, Banks, and Institutional Investors create value in the economy that normies like us can’t. They take your money and stocks and instead of letting them sit, those greedy fucks re-invest to turn a quick buck on money that isn’t theirs. But it doesn’t stop there, the next Big Boy that gets their hand on that money/stock re-invests that too. So at the end of the day that $1.00 you invested can become $10.00, even though you get returns on only $1.00 and take legitimate risk.

Now, is this illegal? No. Does this create value in the Market? Yes. It’s called a **Money Multiplier.** Now you know.

For the Normies: this action multiplies the value of money in the Market. 

For the Apes: your 1 dollar becomes 3. They take your 1 dollar and turn it into 3, give you back your dollar at the end, give another dollar to the CEO of COCKHEAD Hedge Fund, and then profit that third dollar. If you don’t understand that, that’s okay, we still accept you.

But Daddy? I want tendies! Strap that belt and listen before I pull mine out.

**All major investment institutions** engage in these practices. It is standard. The degree is variable, but the practice is standard. This means, that all institutions are connected. Why? Because all these institutions are creating value from point of value that traces through all the institutions involved. 

* You invest 1 dollar. 

* Your Broker reinvests that 1 dollar into another security.

* Hedge Fund Dickweed invests that dollar to another Fund.

* Sister Fucker Fund invests that dollar to Melvin.

* Melvin is broke like my dad after we got fucked in 2009 and can’t do shit with it LOL (how’s it feel?).

But what happens when you pull that dollar out? It’s gone. No one gets that value. So in general, there are millions upon millions of investments predicated on Money Multipliers. This creates a giant web, where all banks and Hedge Funds are connected, because if a few big boys go out, so do their values, which decrease the value of the Market and decrease the value of the entire economy. 

If a major player who acts as a Money Multiplier goes out, this means the chain is altered and the total amount of value in the economy drops. I.e. prices go down because there is less value in the economy, which lowers prices everywhere, and finally lowers a Private Institution’s buying power. 

Look at it this way. If 10% of all money got taken out of the Stock Market, what would happen? The fall in prices would be much bigger than 10% because 1 dollar can be used to create the value 5. This would lead to a fall bigger than 10% of value, and people would be spooked, pulling out EVEN MORE real dollars, which would lead to a decrease greater than the cash they pull out because the Money Multiplier effect is also taken away. And guess what that leads to? No. Not tendies, dipshit. That causes more people to pull out and that is a self fulfilling prophecy. This is what it means to be **too big to fail.**

Understood? I know, I know, how do we make tendies off of this? Just wait.

**This isn’t new information.** This is basic Undergraduate Economic shit. The **Big Chunkers,** and I mean **BIG CHUNKERS** (think of your major banks and Investment institutions) know not to get fucked in these webs after 2008. **They know** how fucked everyone would be if they got caught bagholding this because it would reverberate everywhere because they really influence the economy. But they don’t care about you. They know that if they are fucked it’ll affect their values and they don’t want that.

What does this mean? They’ll act like they can continually extend credit and try to salvage their Friends’ shorts, but they can’t. They know that even if they want to, they can’t come to help their poor fallen rich friends because if they do, they’re screwed even more and they’re going to screw all of their other rich friends too if they end up getting caught. We caught them.
The big boys know they can’t come in and bag hold. If they have diamond hands, they’ll have loss porn greater than anything we’ve seen and so will the entire economy. They know they have to **GTFO or stay out.** 

So what happens now? The DD from all the others reign true. The squeeze will come. We can outlast them. What else are we going to do in goddamn Pandemic? I’m here to tell you that Prince John and his chronies can’t come in to save his guards from Robinhood, Little John, and WSB. This is why the squeeze will come, there’s no out. But wait, there’s more information you need to know.

The Big Lie

If you haven’t seen it already, they’re running smear campaigns saying everything from Foreign interference to a new bubble. No. We have to launch our own counter campaign and educate the people around us IRL what is happening. That’s the only way we fight the misinformation. We’re in our echo chamber and we know the truth, but to stop from being regulated into oblivion we have to let people know the truth. 

If you don’t tell your friends and family, then who is CNBC? Usually the first piece of information someone hears dictates their perception of the issue. Please, as much as it is your duty to HOLD it is your duty to EDUCATE. If everyone knows the truth, then what happens when everyone floods their representatives and social media arguing for the little guys? 

We’ve seen the power of the MAGA mob to try and overturn an election. They had the whole Republican Party in their grasp. We’re stronger, we’re retarded and we have the tendies to prove it. We did this. We can do anything.

Don’t forget! Everyone got fucked in 2008. If they know the truth, they won’t bend over and accept this BS from shills like CNBC and the Big Boys. The people have to stand up and make the biggest stink in the world, and that’s how we top this off in the history book. We don’t let them get the last laugh. We don’t let them screw us over in the lawbooks too.

I don’t know about you boys, but I’m going to buy my mom that house we lost 12 in 2009.

625 shares of GME. I’m going interstellar, I don't know about you.


SEC here too? Maybe you can learn something from us and target the people who actually manipulate markets and ruin lives? These people cause generational trauma and incalculable suffering by ridding people who actually add value into the economy into the ground. Please do your job.

Daddy must came clutch last night to give us a much needed boost after hours, and today was a blow out. You guys are freaking diamond handed kings! 

&#x200B;

To the point, how would you guys feel about a joint collaborative effort to create legal resistance to hedge fund groups and the sec? A joint funded attorney, or firm, to represent the interest of retail traders. Specifically this group. Its obvious that Melvin Capital is very upset by the multi billion $$ loss they are about to eat. But they created the rules that we are all forced to play under. I don't think its fair for them to get to move the goal post every time they have a major loss. 

&#x200B;

There is already tremendous amounts of evidence of market manipulation from major hedge funds in an attempt to keep GME prices down. On top of their allegedly false claims to have closed their short positions this morning. 

&#x200B;

I for one am proud of the tremendous effort this sub has made to bring us together and allow us to see opportunities as a whole. But we need protection to ensure that we are not lumped in with the firms and hedge funds. We obviously have done nothing wrong. 

&#x200B;

I think we should also push to get rid of rules that make it difficult for retail traders to get in the game in the first place. Like the $25,000.00 account requirement for day trading.

There is only one thing everyone needs to know: we are in a situation where profit is theoretically infinite. It’s just dependent on the psychology of the bag holders. Remember the hedge funds have to buy ALL shares after Friday, no matter the price, because that's what they agreed to.

The more everyone holds, and the more people buy, the higher the price will go, and the more money everyone will get. But that's where collective psychology comes into play: ""What if people start selling before $1000 and I don't make it in time?"" ""What if I sell my bags for a nice profit right now?""

This is known as the [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) , where one person betrays another to make a small profit instead of working with the other person to make a bigger profit for both, only because he's afraid the other person might betray him first.

In this case, if we all hold, we make as much as we want to make. Again, theoretically infinite. If we start betraying each other, we only hurt ourselves, and make less.

The picture is clear, buy and hold until their deadline is up, and sell it to THEM. Not to fellow squeezers.

Before you autists get all frothy at me, I'm not telling anyone to give up their 💎🙌. The beauty of stocks is that you can own more than one.

AMC opened today at 4x the price, after trending up for days. It bounced around half its ATH of $35, before closing at 300% gain for the day.

GME hit $380 today, up six times its all time high of $63. The current GME price scares away non-autist retail investors, and at that price, new buyers will be expending multiples more capital for the same upward pressure.

If you don't believe me, look at the numbers. As GME is hitting mainstream and is the big hotness on this sub, AMC also outperformed GME by 165% by close today.

Also, #saveAMC is already trending as it gains traction across social media. People are actively looking for a new GME they feel they missed the boat on.

Despite how low the price already was, it has a record number of shorts: over 38 million. This means another short squeeze isn't just on the menu - it's already starting. This doesn't distract from GME's slaughter of hedge funds because it's the next wave of their an hero.

AMC has raised a billion dollars to weather out coronavirus, amid an ongoing ""Safe & Clean"" push. Some studios like WB are moving to parallel releases on HBO Max, but AMC is already throwing out deals to get people in the door.

Keep holding and you'll never have to worry about money again. Diamond hand all the way, don't sell, just buy and hold.

B = short sellers price they executed at   
   
**MOST IMPORTANT FACT**:
**HOLD THE LINE - CANT STOP - WONT STOP - GAMESTOP** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
   
DISCLAIMER:    
IM RETARDED ... this is not financial advice, do your own due diligence    
   
While on this rocket ride up, when one buys and holds a stock, it is not available to short sellers to either buy and close their position or short sell again to increase their overall position   
   
Retard Facts:    

* ~70+ million shares went short in December around an avg price of $18. Most of these short positions are still opened along with millions of new short positions at $40, $60 and $90. There are only ~50 million shares available to the public to trade with, so there are more shares short than shares made available to trade with. The more is bought and held, the less are available to the shorts        

* When A > B over time, owners of A pay interest rate, usually on a monthly basis, to keep and hold A until A becomes less than B and they close their position     

* When the difference between A and B increases over time, the owners of A interest rate can increase, this can be exacerbated when the difference between A and B is huge, as well when there are no shares to 'buy to cover' or 'short to continue increasing their overall position'    

* At some in the future (days, weeks, months) and A > B continues, owners of A can be forced to close their position. This means at some point the ~70million shares will be forced to close and almost everyone of the ~50 million shares that are held and not made available to buy, the small amount of shares that are available to buy will increase dramatically in price as this becomes a simple supply and demand play, which increases all ~50 million shares value.    

   
   
**WHAT IS POSSIBLE**    
Possible exit strategy for everyone, watch how the last bullet point plays out, by watching the volume of stock traded and avail shares at that time. For the short sellers being forced to buy are the ones taking the loss when the stock is sold at a price of $9000, $10k, $50k, etc. until all ~70+ million short positions are closed. Who knows how long this can take, minutes, hours, days, but since we hold, this will happen

That may or may not be true, but it is clear now that **it is more than just one whale short selling**. And based on what I see, **short sellers are being squeezed HARD**.

Why?

* Prime brokers typically use the closing price of the stock to determine whether to issue margin calls and/or liquidation takeovers. These demands must be met before market open the next day.
* Today, $GME *opened* \~+108%. That means there was so much buying open interest prior/at the market open. This didn't always happen (see last few days). I think **the huge open interest** ***at the open*** **is from short sellers (from yesterday) being forced to buy back**.

**TL;DR**

Likely:

* If the stock opens flat, and trickles up throughout the day - that is from real buying and not short squeeze.
* If the stock opens with a significant gap up - that may be indicative some short squeeze, significant overnight news, etc. (**was the case today**)."|2021-01-27 16:42:28.000827|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_164304.csv|StockTicker|['$GME', 'HARD', '$GME', 'I']|['GME', 'GME']|['CNBC', 'I', '$GME', 'I']|['GME']

GME and AMC.

Wanna know why the price can go up by a lot? Because there are Hedge Funds that are heavily short into these stocks. Today's trending hashtag on Twitter was #SaveAMC because it nearly bankrupted, so you can bet that Wall Street is shorting this, in fact, there are currently $38 MILLION USD worth of shorts on [$AMC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMC&src=cashtag_click).

So when these short-sellers don't hit their price target, they have to come out of pocket to COVER the shorts or buy the shares.

And as you can guess this causes the price to rise... to the moon!

GME is 350 USD so buy this one if you have at least >350$.

If you have a smaller capital and want to get almost the same profits, go for AMC which is 19.90$.

Oh btw the SEC is viewing these posts, so let them feel welcomed!

One would have thought that the subsequent bank bailouts [heads I win, tails you (taxpayers) lose] would have taught Wall St. a lesson in moral hazard, but WSBs, with GME, has done more to teach Wall St. that lesson than all the lip service given to moral hazard by our government and financial oversight agencies and regulators that are supposed to regulate Wall St.

Telling the CNBC guy to publicly attack and humiliate Chamath and force him to spread bad opinions about GME?

""Gamestop cannot trade above 40 MAX because of fundamentals???"" Your MOM cannot trade above Ryah Cohen's 40 inch rod penetrating her face.

Telling people to ask JPOW questions about GME and having others FOLLOW-UP with more stupid questions about GME, when he's responsible for talking about monetary and public policy? WTF? How low can you boomers get?

I hope you wall street losers come here and read how gay you sound.

I know there are tons of whale lurkers in here. My money is PEANUTS compared to lord DFV but I'm finally ready to fight and 💎🤚 this. It's no longer about the money now. It's about sending a message. WE LIKE THE STOCK.

Positions: 370 shares bought at the top. Watched it plummet to 200 and back to 350 and ZERO FKS were given. Will likely shove 300-700k more tomorrow. 

Pro tip: put a limit sell at something high like 10000 so brokers can't lend your shares out.

this is just my opinion but I believe in abiding by the law and just spreading my opinion.  No facts are presented Thereof of this post.

Here is the strategy in my opinion 

1.  Raid High Short interest stocks.  Stop shouting over each other and plan plan plan out your investments 

2.  Keep keep holding, give the hedge funds aids.  Give em aides and don’t pay for the bill.

3.  Unite each other.  GME in my opinion is a good stock.  Let’s fuckin go you fuckin retards.

I saw what y’all were doing here, saw it all on Twitter and thought I’d give it a go. 

I have about $50 to mess around with (I can afford to lose this if it happens, It was probably gonna get spent on UberEats anyways lol) and I wanted to know what would best to see any type of gain?

I already bought 1 stock in AMC but I also see NOK is prettt low right now so I wanted to know should I buy $50 worth of it or split it between it and AMC?

I’m not looking to get rich but learn more about how this all works I guess.

As a community, we have been a beacon of hope, glimmering in the distance as a guide for hedge funds around the world to navigate the tumultuous ocean of investing. As of recent, the hedge funds that we have long guided have strayed from their paths and began sinking amid the ocean currents. That is why I am here today. I believe it is our time to help our brothers in investing. It is time for us to help these struggling hedge funds to learn how to properly invest and manage risk tolerance.

Today, I present to you the opportunity to give back to Melvin Capital and all other hedge funds that have lost so much in this turbulent time. I have found [a great book](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51RsIdKQJML.jpg) that you may choose to send as a gift to their offices if you so desire. This book seeks to teach introductory-level financial risk management in managing a portfolio--a lesson seemingly forgotten by our friends at these poor, poor hedge funds. I believe it is our duty as a community to take the high ground and teach hedge fund managers how to properly manage risk within their portfolios. Alternatively, if reading proves too hard for the hedge fund managers, I propose sending them your best crayon drawing depicting proper risk management.

TL;DR: Send [Financial Risk Management for Dummies](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51RsIdKQJML.jpg) or a crayon drawing showing how to properly manage risk to Melvin Capital and Citron so they can learn from us how to be better, more responsible investors."|2021-01-27 16:44:17.256772|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_164457.csv|StockTicker|['I']|[]|['WSB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'KQJML', 'I', 'I', 'KQJML']|[]

I’m in the Midwest and am trading in the NYSE. GME options. I have contacted two lawyers that deal with securities fraud and there is a CHANCE they will take us up.

WE COULD MAKE THIS A CLASS ACTION!

My biggest concerns right now is the BLATANT FRAUD Melvin Capital committed this morning at market open with the help on CNBC. Because of their lies about closing their position, after previously saying they do not disclose their holdings to media, the stock dropped more than 9% and triggered a circuit breaker giving large hedge funds and investors the opportunity to collude or use their super fast computers to make money.

My BIGGEST potential worry though is the SEC halting trading and 2+MM autists not being able to close or exercise their options, losing out on MILLIONS in FAILRY made gains. I believe this would be illegal.

We have a decent chance of being a class action suit against MELVIN SHITRON POINT72 (AND THE SEC IF THEY FUCK WITH US).

Please let me know if you’re interested in being apart of a class action lawsuit.

Of course may DADDY Elon bless you, may all your STONKS touch the moon.

This may not be a popular post or opinion, but I am curious about some things.. why haven't the shorters been margin called yet? 

There's speculation or rather fake news that Melvin had closed their positions. Citron said they did. And I know if that had been the case, the price would've shot up if you reference the VW squeeze but what if they were really telling the truth, and exiting their positions all along? The price has been pretty stagnant after opening each day, with most action in AH and PM. 

The shorts are rumored to still be over 100% but if that's the case and there was no margin call, and Melvin did exit, that would mean they exited slowly over time and NEW shorters are entering the market. It's a lot easier to short a price of $350 than it is of $3, just in regard to the actual floor. Could it be that the old shorters exited and took their losses, while new shorters have now come in waiting us all out? Which could mean that there is no actual short squeeze because at this point, the volume traded every day is extremely high, which means they could have washed their hands of the imminent squeeze, and the new shorters are banking that the boredom will reign and GME will go down on it's own. 

Just wanna hear everyone's opinions... and rocket rocket rocket lol."|2021-01-27 16:54:49.574586|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_165529.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['I', 'I', 'VW', 'AH', 'PM', 'NEW', 'GME']|['PM', 'GME']

Single stock equity options are American style. You can exercise them at any time. Generally you should never exercise an option prior to expiry. The exception is when a (call) option is deeply in the money and the cost to borrow the stock is high. In which case, you can be better off exercising the option, and taking delivery of the underlying so you can earn money from lending the security. But it varies on a contract to contract basis. If you don't, you're effectively giving your counter-party free money.

I don't feel comfortable making recommendations about specific contracts. But a lot of you have very ITM calls you should take a look at. Your ability to receive the interest earned from security lending depends on the rules your broker has. So rolling your position may make more sense depending on your particular situation."|2021-01-27 16:54:49.574586|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_165529.csv|StockTicker|['ITM', 'A']|['A']|['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'ITM']|[]

You guys gotta understand why its up so high. everyone here is holding until its at 1k or even 10k, not until ""friday"" if your stuff expires for Friday and it isn't at 1k yet then reset. The reason this is working is because the firms that are shorting the stock have to buy the stock back later to pay for the stock they borrowed. As long as we all stay in (or just most) then the stock price we set has to be payed. It's simple, we own all the stock and we only sell for 1k, that is final. It is insane how many short positions there are right now. guarantied that when the shorts interest gets to high they will have to pay our price for the stock which is 1k! NOT WHATEVER ITS GONNA BE FRIDAY.

PT calculation for GME


All 3 are from premarket from a 3 minute candle setup. Times for each candle are 9:15, 9:18, 9:27. Why these candles? They are completely green with no wicks.


9:15 Low 248 High 268 Volume 336k Price Range is 20$ 1$ per 16.8k Volume

9:18 Low 267.77 High 327 Volume 948k Price Range is 60$ 1$ per 15.8k Volume

9:27 Low 324 High 354.8 Volume 564k Price Range is 30$ 1$ per 18.8k Volume


My reasons for using these candles is because there was no resistance on em when I was watching, they just went up indicating institutional buying. Assuming I am correct we have 1$ move per average 17.13k Volume. We have ~70M shares shorted on GME, which accounts to ~4k$ price move. We are currently trading at 330$. If they outright cover all the shares, which they won't we will arrive at a PT of 4.3k$ for 0 Short Interest on GME. This PT also doesn't include the gamma squeezes from MM, and the bullish buying from investors. So I would say the most conservative PT for GME would be the most unlikely scenario which is 4.3k$ if the shorts just cover the entire SI. Otherwise this can keep going higher for completely different reasons as I mentioned."|2021-01-27 16:54:49.574586|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_165529.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['DD', 'I', 'PT', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'M', 'GME', 'PT', 'GME', 'PT', 'MM', 'I', 'PT', 'GME', 'SI', 'I']|['DD', 'PT', 'GME', 'M', 'GME', 'PT', 'GME', 'PT', 'MM', 'PT', 'GME']

l6fgbn||The other post about SLV is absolutely correct. Silver is by far the most manipulated market in the world. JPM just paid $1 billion fine for their manipulation and they brushed it off and kept doing it. The other post didn’t say how to cause the squeeze, here’s how to play it|t3_l6fgbn|0.69|6|6|new|2021-01-28 00:55:29.000000|TheHappyHawaiian|2|DD|/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6fgbn/the_other_post_about_slv_is_absolutely_correct/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6fgbn/the_other_post_about_slv_is_absolutely_correct/|https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6fgbn/the_other_post_about_slv_is_absolutely_correct/|"First here is the other post https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l68ill/the_biggest_short_squeeze_in_the_world_slv_silver/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Second, everyone buy and hold GME through at least $1000 before buying silver because the shorts are still at 139% of the float so there is a technical reason to stay long until they really cover.

Third, the other post said to buy miners, but that won’t cause a silver squeeze. The miners will benefit from the squeeze, but buying miners alone does nothing to actually beat the manipulating banks at their own game in silver.

So here’s how you do it:

Buy SLV directly.  No options.  This is a very old and slightly slower moving market than equities so unless you are buying leaps, SLV shares are the way to go anyways.  Alternatively, buy silver physically or even force delivery through purchasing futures if you are rich and can store it.  Physical silver purchases carry a premium over spot price though so you end up causing more physical silver to be purchased by simply buying SLV.

By purchasing SLV, more shares will be created and SLV will have to purchase massive amounts of physical silver to hold in their vaults because the etf has to remain backed by physical silver.  

Silver is a much larger market than GME, but the paper traded gold market is 100x the physical market.  If we force more physical purchase and delivery of silver, the paper traders will be required to buy it in real life and deliver it. Creating a positive feedback loop just like a short squeeze.

Lastly, the fundamental case is that government stimulus combined with fed money and reopening economy will cause inflation, and that government debt loads mean dollar debasement. Lest someone say we are manipulating the market (as big banks have literally been doing for decades). We like the stock!

Let’s get GME to the moon and then park all of the winnings in SLV. Could take a couple of months to fully moon as delivery of silver takes time but it really could go to $1000 from $25.  If GME took down a single hedge fund, this would take down JPM. 

Power and tendies to people! 

TLDR: don’t sell GME till over $1000 and then move it all to SLV and hold for 3+ months"|2021-01-27 17:02:02.093741|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_170243.csv|StockTicker|['SLV', 'JPM']|['JPM']|['GME', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'SLV', 'GME', 'GME', 'SLV', 'GME', 'JPM', 'GME', 'SLV']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'JPM', 'GME']

One of the stated goals you guys have allready achieved by crushing Malvin Capital beneath your boot.

Historically, doing this was the game of big capital investors, the world bank and western 'development' funds like the IWF. These caste of leeches to the productive capabilities of regular working people have mostly not even done this for the gains of the western industrialised nations, but themselves and their cronies.

The story of how George Soros bet against the pound and forced the Europeans to give up the price binding of the british currency is legion and taught in basic economics classes today.

Those kinds of schemes have only been possible with the combined effort of few big investors that would then not just cash in on their heists, but force the peoples of the world to do their bidding.

What if...

the peoples would bet against the dollar to take away the financial capacity of Wall Street to scam the whole world, while providing the american workers a devalued currency that makes it more attractive to actually produce goods and services in the US for the international market?

the peoples would bet on bonds of nations that got screwed over by huge investment banks and literally got forced to sell their assets for a fraction of their worth?

the peoples would keep on betting against rich institutional investors, just because?

the peoples don't like the face of a new national leader and bet against his country with the expressed purpose of pushing him or her out of office?

With GME the memes are great, but there is still one institutional investor that wins big. That is Black Rock.

Chamath, it is time you set up the /r/wallstreetbets SPAC and lead us and our small $ accounts to greatness. Day in and day out /r/wallstreetbets posts about starting our own hedge fund, or having their own investing group to make hella tendies, but time in and time out, we fucking lose them on FD's. Fuck Melvin Capital. 

This is where you come in Chamath. We need you to form, design, and lead the charge for the /r/wallstreetbets SPAC, where anyone whose a member of /r/wallstreetbets (for over a year cuz fuck you bot ass fucks), can partake in the SPAC with a minimum buy-in, say $10,000.

Given 99% of /r/wallstreetbets are poor fucks living in their mom's basement (mom if you see this, thanks for the internet and pop-tart), we will never be accredited investors and able to invest in traditional private equity deals. We are left to deal with lemon fuckers of Citron. Fuck u/realAndrewLeft. 

**Game Plan:** 

1. Chamath set's up the SPAC and opens it for participants. Let's say we start the initial SPAC at a $100M. It'd only take 5,000 of us to invest $20,000. Sure, it's a shitty logistical nightmare for whichever poor fuck as to dish out our K-1 tendies, but Chamath is helping the good people. 

2. We use our SPAC to buy some fucking tendie producing Company, turn our $100M into $500M in 3-years, rinse and repeat. 

3. After the first SPAC goes live, we start another. 

4. Buy Melvin Capital's shitty fund, write a hit piece on Citron, and shit Citron out of business. 

5. Splash tendies and video games for everyone as we can finally own GameStop and go broke.

It will work at first, when things are great, but t's very likely most of you will experience your first pump and dump. You can expect this for GME once DFV shares with us he has exited his positions entirely. 

Here's what I recommend some of you new guys do to stay ahead of this. It wasn't too long ago when the most loved tickers were ARK etfs, TSLA, ICLN, any FAANG, PLTR, PTON, TDOC, SQ, PLUG, ZM, DKNG and so on. You can go back a few weeks to see this for yourself. I have good news for you. Many of these much loved tickers are experiencing a dip that us autist only wished for a few weeks ago. When things go back to normal, and the next memes are being thrown around, one thing will always stay the same. WE LOVE TECH. WE LOVE ELON. AND WE LOVE AUNT CATHIE. Yes, we love bald bezo too  and all these tickers I mentioned earlier. 

Of course always do your own DD, and understand short plays from long plays. Ask around. What LEAPS do you have? This 1990s party wont last forever. Always stay one-step ahead, and buy the fucking dip."|2021-01-27 17:02:02.093741|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_170220.csv|StockTicker|['WSB', 'GME', 'GME', 'BB', 'AMC', 'NOK']|['GME', 'GME', 'AMC', 'NOK']|['I', 'WSB', 'DD', 'GME', 'DFV', 'I', 'ARK', 'TSLA', 'ICLN', 'FAANG', 'PLTR', 'PTON', 'TDOC', 'SQ', 'PLUG', 'ZM', 'DKNG', 'I', 'WE', 'LOVE', 'TECH', 'WE', 'LOVE', 'ELON', 'AND', 'WE', 'LOVE', 'AUNT', 'ATHIE', 'I', 'DD', 'LEAPS']|['DD', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'ICLN', 'PLUG', 'TECH', 'ELON', 'DD']

At the same time my mother's retirement got eviscerated by the recession and it NEVER recovered yet somehow the company that managed her portfolio came out ahead and awarded bonuses.  Gee I wonder how that fuck happened.

Today I called her and I got to tell her that her prescription costs are covered from here on out, because that has been a legitimate concern for her.  She's my fucking hero and she was a school teacher for the last 30 years because she just loves kids.  My mother has chosen between heating her house and her prescriptions before and prior to this shes refused to take anything from her children because she doesn't want our lives to be harder.  I've got a decent career but she still wouldn't take anything believing it would make life harder for us.  Unbelievable.

I got to show her the earning potential on this and she accepted.  Whether it goes tits up or not is irrelevant at this point as she knows I'm retarded and there's no helping me once she's gone.  She cried.  I sobbed.  I can't think of anything I'd rather do with this gain other than go to the elementary schools in my area like the ones she taught in and get them supplies they need.

Ya know why? Not because I need a bunch of cash, not because I want memes, but because we need to stand up. I remember how scared my parents were in 2008, when speculation tanked my family's savings and my grandparent's retirements. I watched Chamath on CNBC today. He gets it. It's inspiring to see people wake up to the inequality in our economy. Everyday folks are **ALWAYS** the ones who suffer from the wild speculation our financial institutions engage in. The pre-covid insider trading ALONE, was audacious. The pandemic, downplayed as thousands died. In a way, it's so similar to how the housing bubble led people to lose their pensions, their jobs, their homes. It's time we recoup the wealth that was stolen in 2008. This is our stand.

This is simply a friendly reminder that STONKS ONLY GO UP is only a fucking joke by other retards that gain/lose money here.  Do not invest money you cannot afford to lose.


**GME**

If you are not already in on this stock, you probably aren't too late but your ability to time the squeeze is going to be much more perfect than most of the people on this sub that got in earlier this month. The stock needed to force this squeeze are most likely already owned and it could take days/weeks before the actual ""top"" is reached and if you don't pay attention YOU could lose money buying in now.


GME is happening because after it starting going up the short sellers had to eventually cover these naked calls.  This is an AMAZING thing to witness, but it is NOT going to happen to every other stock.  What you are feeling is FOMO (fear of missing out), and it is why MOST of this sub loses money every week (me included).



**After GME**

If you do nail the timing or bought in below $200.  DO NOT FUCKING DO THIS AGAIN.  The last short squeeze like this was in 2008!  Wake the fuck up.  Waste your money on weeklies like a normal retard, don't go buying up shares of companies that are failing.  This subreddit is full of LOSS porn, and for every good DD that ends up successful there are 5 more that tanked.

**Shorting is when you think a company is going to do badly so you borrow that company stock from a broker and promise to pay them back later.**

Here is a Non-Stock Example:

Imagine that you thought **apples were going to go down in value** and they currently cost **$1.**

You go to a shop keeper and ask if you can borrow an apple which you will give back later.

You borrow the apple from him and sell it someone for $1 and then wait for the price to change. If the price goes down to 50 cents then you can buy 2 apples for a dollar. You go back to the shopkeeper and give him back the apple. 

**He has an apple back and you have an extra 50 cents.** 

**In stock market terms you have shorted them apples**. Now replace the apples with stocks and you hopefully get the idea.

2 other things worth mentioning about short positions f**irst you have to pay an interest rate** **on your short positions** because you're borrowing something.

Secondly, **short positions can be greater than 100% of stock.**

**Let’s get to GME**

GME is a brick and mortar video game company, after Covid hit Gamestop **unsurprisingly** has a couple of bad months and revenue falls. GME falls to about $4 per share.

Largely because of this many **big international investors essentially thought Gamestop was going to go bust and therefore shorted GME.** 

Hoping to see it collapse, they didn’t see that there was some good news coming Gamestop’s way.

Firstly in **Mid August our saviour Ryan Cohen started buying GME shares.** By December Cohens company had bought about 9 million share (13% GME). 

Then in January Cohen and some other CEOs were appointed to Gamestop’s board.

This gave Gamestop a huge advantage as **now they’ve got a billionaire investor who’s experienced with running ecommerce companies** which is exactly the business model Gamestop needs to shift to. 

Secondly in **November PS5 and Xbox series X was released starting a new console cycle** which is good news for Gamestop.

Thirdly Gamestop **signed a deal with Microsoft which gave them a share of all of Xbox’s digital revenues** 

So, what happened to the stock?

Firstly, the institutions that were shorting GME bought more short positions to try to supress the stock price.

This chart shows that for example on January 11th **there are massive 4 million short positions** taken despite the fact that this was the day Cohens board appointments were announced.

&#x200B;

*Processing img 1f15o9e96yd61...*

In total 71 million short positions were taken even though Gamestop only had a float of 69.75 million shares. Remember you can have more short positions that actual shares.

This gets crazier because about 20% of Gamestop shares is held by insiders like Cohen. Insiders can’t sell easily because of regulations.

&#x200B;

There is the same amount again owned by big institutions who don’t normally trade either. 

&#x200B;

*Processing img 7lb9az0d6yd61...*

**So that leaves between 20 to 30 million actively traded stocks and 71 million short positions who all need to buy stock**

That is a lot of demand and not much supply. Wallstreet Bets realized this and determined that if they bought the stock and **held** they could force the price up which triggers a **short squeeze.** 

Where people with short positions desperately buy into a stock and try to cover before the price gets too high. These people are losing money but covering now prevents them from bigger losses.

**However because there isn’t enough stocks to go around the price of each stock jumps spectacularly**.

Remember it costs money to shorter position forever because of interest **so they want to act fast** which is exactly what happened to Volkswagen in 2008. Where it breifly became the most expensive stock in history. **Which is exactly what is happening with GME right now!**

&#x200B;

*Processing img c5wx45mg6yd61...*

Ulitmatly Redditors made big money and **if you hold for longer you will make more.** 

The 2 big short sellers who lost big money is **Melvin Capital and Citeron Resarch.**

**You can tell that they are panicking because 2 days ago Melvin Capital had to be bailed out by 2 big insitutions which isnt good for them.**

**There is a lot of short postions to be covered if you hold for longer the price for each stock will increase.**

Secondly if you've seen anything about this in the news it's often spun as mental reddit investors ruin the market **there's three things worth saying here**:

Firstly, wall street bets doesn't actually **hold much sway over the market itself as WSB is an internet forum not an institution**.

Secondly, it's not as if the market was rational **beforehand it's just that only hedge funds used to be able to manipulate** it and this wasn't even clear manipulation obviously some of GME's rise is a function of speculation but there's a good argument that it was undervalued and over shorted to begin with.

Thirdly it's fundamentally a good thing that people are able to get into the stock market and make **money off GME as it might make things more volatile and harder for hedge funds.**

But fuck Wall Street.

tl;dr: Melvin Capital and other big short shellers were caught with their dick in the cookie jar when they overshorted GME making GME shares go to the fucking moon. If you hold GME you could be able to go to fucking Alpha Centuri and bankrupt big short shellers"|2021-01-27 17:02:02.093741|../output/raw/2021/01/27/StockTicker_170242.csv|StockTicker|['GME']|['GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'X', 'GME', 'GME', 'WSB', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']|['GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'X', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME']

I am now 37, and of my favorite things to do with my son is grab a JUICY BURGER (that's what he calls fast food) and hit up our local gamestop. There's nothing more rewarding than letting him pick out 2 or 3 games/toys/magazines that he can pick up, examine, smell, or read.

My son would be absolutely devastated if these greedy investment firms were able to manipulate the market and push GME out of business for their own personal game. I genuinely believe something will be lost if we lose SPECIALIZED retail stores. I KNOW I can buy games from [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com/). I KNOW that it's probably $2 cheaper at Walmart. But it's just not the same.

Not only do I believe in GameStop, but I believe they have the ability to become the Williams-Sonoma of gaming. This whole GME experience has awakened something in me. I fully intend to support more specialized/boutique stores in the future. THANKS WALLSTREETBETS!

The problem aren't the hedge funds, they are only playing the fiat game, the central banks are the real scammers at the end of the day, they are the ones forcing manipulation from part of hedge funds and the stock market with a system of infinite money.

Negative interest rates are their ACE card, those hedge funds can and probably will do something to fuck up all this situation.

Between pre and post market, haltings new positions, and other toold they will try to flip this shitshow the proves how broken and corrupt all the legacy financial system it.

I sincerely hope all of you win, and not those fucking scammers in suits.

I have a recommendation about the future of finaces, currencies, store of value, etc... in the new digital era, but you dont want to hear it, i guess to will have to discover it for yourself, and i know you will, because you are so retarded that you have gone over the limit and become geniuses.

Please correct me if i write something wrong. but to recap the whole situation:

Melvin Capital shorts GME, potentially driving Gamestop to bancrupcy and the wonderfull degenerates on reddit decided to strike back against the evil billionare corporates by buying GamesStocks. is that right?
