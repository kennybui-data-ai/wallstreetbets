I think the large players are starting to realize they need to take the retards on reddit seriously. I think they're attempting to astroturf the investing subreddits by giving awards to tickers they have a vested interest in. And at this moment, that's anything that isn't GME. They know that once the prevailing enthusiasm subsides they'll have the opportunity to close.

Stay wary and stay vigilant my comrades. This is a war of attrition.

DISTRACT AND DIVERT

PUSH PROFIT TAKING

There are people on these forums right now who work for the short sellers who's only goal is to divert your attention away from GME and into other stocks such as $BB. It is their hope that if they can push the narrative 'take some or all of your profits and jump onto the next big thing"" that the stock will hold steady and stem the bleeding long enough to lose momentum. 

DO NOT BELIEVE these posts. They aren't investment advice, we are being attacked by outsiders that want to drive us out of GME at any cost.

Beware of any advice like ""Wow, that is a lot of money you made, you could just withdraw and pay off your house!"". It is a TRAP. 

They have until Friday, if this run-up continues they will have no choice but to close their short positions causing a massive blow-up of the stock price. IF THEIR STRATEGY DOESN'T SUCCEED BY FRIDAY - THERE WILL BE A RACE TO CLOSE SHORT POSITIONS AND THE STOCK WILL MOON.

Wow - what a week. This is an extension of my DD series on GME. If you haven’t read them and have time, they will provide some background on my previous predictions, some of which have already come true. 

# Previous Important Posts

* [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) (DTC Infinity) covered the short positions, the float, and potential snowball impacts of increasing prices, and argued that part of the reason that shorts haven’t closed was that it was pretty much impossible for shorts to close 
* [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) covered Cohen, fair market cap analysis, and potential investors, in which I talked about the amazing mid-to-long term potential for GME. 
* After the Citron tweet, I shared this [fan fiction on what looked like blatant market manipulation by shorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) on the day of the tweet, and offered some education on strengthening your position. This one got buried and is worth reading. 

# What’s happened thus far

### Why did GME go up on Friday? 

The story here is more complex than paid media articles would like you to believe. GME has been driven up by 3 different forces: 

* Organic buying
   * There is a mixture of growing positive sentiment in the investor world (not just WSB) about GME’s future
   * There’s been a lot of good due diligence shared not just on WSB but even outside (for example, see gmedd.com)
   * The Citron Backfire
      * Shorts were on the ropes and kept looking for hail mary’s. They went to Citron and [coordinated a dump](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) to try to bring the price down.
      * However, this backfired. Citron is so disliked in the industry that new wealth poured into GME in the face of Andrew Left’s pleas. Even when Benzinga brought Andrew Left on air, **minutes after he left** [they bought shares live on their show](https://youtu.be/mFiFWBrE5DE?t=5104)**.** 
      * The next day, our very on u/Uberkikz11 [was on Benzinga](https://youtu.be/GLzTU87MJMM?t=837) and more shares were bought. 
   * Larger investors piling in
      * In my [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/), I hypothesized that we’d soon see larger investors pile in. Then, on WSB, we saw posts from a [venture capitalist](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/) as well as a [hedge fund investor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/)
* Gamma squeeze
   * Once the organic buying started, we rolled into a gamma squeeze. Many people written about the gamma squeeze so I won’t repeat, see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/) for an example. 
* Ultra low liquidity - In EndGame part 1, I talked about how the actual actively traded shares are much lower than the reported float, and **share availability has been reducing** driven by lots of diamond hands, not just among smaller guys like us but the larger folks too. 
* I believe there were some short covers on Friday, but Ortex was still estimating 71M shares short at the eod. 

However, not many people have talked about why it **went down**

### Why did GME come down? 

Here’s where things got interesting for me, and something I think happened again today (Monday) when GME climbed up over 100% but then had a rapid reversal, closing 20% above yesterday but closing below open. 

So Friday looked like a slam dunk - gamma squeeze, no shorts available to short, puts were getting exceedingly expensive as a short tactic. What happened?

This is my fan fiction, based on what I saw.

**I believe** [**market-makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) **took a non-neutral stance and began actively shorting the stock after the second halt.** 

Market-makers are responsible for maintaining liquidity and functioning in the stock market, but they also have abilities that others don’t - for example they are legally allowed to naked short for “liquidity purposes”. They also have the ability to halt trading. 

There were two halts in the day on Friday: First, when GME was up 69% (heh heh), and then a few minutes later when it kept climbing after the first halt was relaxed. Note that at the time of the first halt, the **bid-ask spread was $10 on the underlying** a huge signal that there just were not enough shares to buy.

However, after the second halt, something strange happened. Whereas a few minutes prior, there were no sellers willing to sell their shares below $75, **within 15 minutes** after the halt there were sellers at 70, 65, 60, and 56. Where did these sellers come from? 

&#x200B;

[Incredible momentum reversal on Friday 1\/22 to push the price not too far above the 60c strike price. ](https://preview.redd.it/tt5zodp6pkd61.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa22980543213227bf5b3d17166129ac6cb65a65)

My speculation? This was a coordinated **naked short ladder attack**. In this type of attack, short seller A sells to short seller B, who then turns around to short seller A at a lower price, etc. and with a **very small amount of capital** you can wreck the momentum of a stock and make people think that others are running for the exits.

Notice how the stock dropped from a high of $75 on Friday to below 60 - the highest expiring SP for the 1/22 options, and stayed tight in range for the rest of the day. Now, for compliance reasons, MM are required to be neutral by EOD, so 20 minutes before close, MMs had to buy back all their short positions, which led to the strong close above 60.

All this led me to believe that the **real fair market price for GME was above $65.** Without the market makers interference, GME would have closed higher. 

### A repeat on Monday

The short ladder attack repeated on Monday. 

GME opened strong above $90, and quickly climbed to **a high above $155** before it was halted, immediately after the halt, a **short ladder attack again** drove the price down 

&#x200B;

[Dejavu - Incredible Momentum Reversal after trading halts. ](https://preview.redd.it/qm81rd0dpkd61.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b4563e7dd2e626fb09dca69668c24631932e707)

Both days, there **were rapid and significant reversals in momentum.** 

Now, I kept wondering - why would MM’s take the side of the shorts? What’s in it for them? One theory was that they were not adequately hedged, with the low liquidity of the stock meaning that the price was moving up too fast for them to acquire the shares they needed to. 

But then the news hit today: 

# A new opponent enters the ring:

&#x200B;

That’s right, the **same Citadel** [**listed by the NYSE as one of their designated market makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) is now invested in Melvin’s hedge fund and has a financial interest in the direction of GME’s share price. 

**Hey media - you want a manipulation story? You’re missing the big one.** 

# Now what? 

Shorts have pulled new dirty tactics each time they’ve been pushed to the edge. Paid media attacks, Citron’s fluff tweet + coordinated shorting, and now they’ve got the **actual people who get all the order flow on their side.** 

On the other hand, GME is still up over 20% and now trading at $88.00 after hours, which is well above the previous day’s high. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rr5qet4ipkd61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=96d28bf446a714906712503726f5903a681d5368

What this tells me is that GME’s **true price is still being suppressed**. They are using every tactic possible, even changing the [bid-ask spread rules](https://thefly.com/permalinks/entry.php/id3233043/GME;IRBT-NYSE-changes-bidask-differentials-on-options-for-GameStop-iRobot) on options to specifically target retail’s buying of options. 

We’re now playing the game against the folks who write the rules of the game. 

Some shorts may have covered today - with prices below $60 at one point they had some great opportunities to. However, there is **no way all of the shorts who need to exit covered today.** 

The short position still lost 20% from yesterday. They’ve got more fingers in the dam, but it’s definitely cracking. Also, **every call option purchased prior to 1/25 is ITM and profitable,** while **every put option purchased prior to 1/25 is OTM.**

And, for some reason, the SEC still doesn’t want to enforce the threshold securities list for GME, where it’s now **been on for more than 30 days in a highly covered “short squeeze”.**

&#x200B;

# Margin impacts:

Note that at this point, most brokers have increased margin on GME. This means that people that are long or short on margin will need to put up capital to hold their positions. 

This also means **puts will get more expensive** as people who sell puts will have to maintain 100% of the notional in their accounts to secure the put, so MMs will have fewer retail sellers of puts to absorb the demand. 

That means it’s not a bad idea to sell puts to acquire shares if you’re aiming for the long-term and not the squeeze, but keep in mind you’ll need the exact same capital as if you’d bought the shares, so it’s up to you on this. 

For shorts, a margin increase while the price is moving against you (even with retracements) is no good. 

# My speculation

* Cohen and the GME board have been strangely silent this entire run. It’s possible they can’t say anything at all during the pre-earnings quiet period, but I’m sure they can see what’s happening. 
* MMs will continue to play dirty, but at the same time they will need to continue to need to buy GME shares to delta hedge 1/29 and later ITM options as we get closer to expiry. 

# Things to be careful about

As you can see, this is no easy win. I've been in GME for a few months but I've seen almost every trick in the book. In addition to the [suggestions I wrote about in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/), here’s some things to be careful about. 

* **Be careful about swapping ITM calls for OTM calls:** it can be tempting to trade-up your options for higher return, but be mindful of the delta impact. You may actually be driving the sale of shares by MMs when you don’t mean to. For example, if you sell a .5 delta call for 2 .2 delta calls, that’s net reduction of 10 shares that MMs have to hold long as leverage. 
* **Be careful about being short any calls this week:** Not only do you limit your upside (which is dumb in the prospect of a squeeze), you could end up in a nightmare scenario. A call that ends OTM on Friday could end up ITM after hours if you didn’t sell it, and you may get assigned while the underlying continues to go up. 
* **There are a few other dirty tactics shorts can play.** I’m not specifically going to share them here because I don’t want to give the ideas circulation, but 
   * **Choose your own limit sells based on personal sell points.** Don’t copy others and don’t try to be memey. Make your own decisions. 
   * **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it’s an **attack vector** for you. 
* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn’t resume for the rest of the day? **All your 1/29 calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you’re taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration. 
* **Be careful about buying on margin.** Brokers are rapidly increasing margins. If you bought on margin with 2:1 leverage, and the stock went up 100%, you’d be in margin call even without a margin change. If the broker moves margin against you, you’ll get to margin call faster. 
* **Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose.** I’ve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing (remember last Monday with the short sale restriction?), you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I’ve held through multiple 30-40% drawdowns in the underlying; and **held through a 50% drawdown today**, so you need to be ready for the volatility. 
* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It’s common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you’ve set a stop loss, be really sure about it. 

This is not financial advice; do your own DD. I’m holding over $1M in shares and calls."|2021-01-26 16:27:08.822090|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_162708.csv|StockTicker|['GME', 'A']|['GME', 'A']|['DD', 'GME', 'DTC', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'WSB', 'GME', 'DE', 'MJMM', 'I', 'WSB', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'M', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'SP', 'MM', 'EOD', 'GME', 'GME', 'A', 'GME', 'I', 'A', 'NYSE', 'GME', 'ITM', 'OTM', 'SEC', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'ITM', 'GME', 'I', 'ITM', 'OTM', 'A', 'OTM', 'ITM', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'ITM', 'GME', 'DD', 'M']|['DD', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'DE', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'M', 'GME', 'I', 'GME', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'SP', 'MM', 'EOD', 'GME', 'GME', 'A', 'GME', 'I', 'A', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'GME', 'I', 'A', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'GME', 'GME', 'DD', 'M']

I keep thinking about these funds that are short GME like your boys at Melvin Capital / your coverage of this subreddit and I’m getting madder and madder. 

These funds can manipulate the market via your network and if they screw up big because they don’t even know the basics of portfolio risk 101 and using position sizing, they just get a bailout from their billionaire friends at Citadel. Then they have the nerve to turn us into public enemy #1 just because we believe in an underdog company getting a second chance. 

We don’t have billionaires to bail us out when we mess up our portfolio risk and a position goes against us. We can’t go on TV and make attempts to manipulate millions to take our side of the trade. If we mess up as bad as they did, we’re wiped out, have to start from scratch and are back to giving handjobs behind the dumpster at Wendy’s.

(before reading, note that they are reporting earnings on the morning of the 26th, I will be taking advantage of the IV crush to open a LEAP position)

To start, I see an awful amount of praise for ETF's when playing this sector. However, while ETF's offer greater security in individual investments, the true risk and reward of playing this sector becomes apparent through the lens of comparison. The three ETF's I concentrated on for this DD are:

* **ICLN**
* **TAN**
* **FAN**

While these are all popular, none of them have weighted NEE anywhere near its capitalization potential. Just the next two years alone will nearly certainly double the stock's market cap. They have over $50B in infrastructure investments planned through 2022, and you can be assured that they will have an advantage to this [in the form of tax credits and subsidies.](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/nee-stock-is-ready-to-soar-under-green-biden-administration/)

That's right, Uncle Sam is going to skullfuck this company with tax credits and subsidies to the point that this thing could have a TSLA-esque potential. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, how does this company look when lined up among some competition?

The particular interest with NEE is that they seemingly do it all. This shit is like the Chic-Fil-A of the energy sector. It could honestly not give less of a shit about saving the world, its only focus is cash flow, which in terms that WSB is accustomed to, is just fuel reserves for its inevitable moon mission. I analyzed 3 different companies in the renewable energy sector, and those were

1. Plug Power
   1. slowing of net income in Q/Q growth.
2. Enphase
   1. already boomed. the party for this one got busted pretty fast. imo just a shitty boomer pick
3. First Solar
   1. This one is a legitimate competitor in my view. 
   2. I would honestly invest in this if its revenue sources were more diverse.

So taking these into account, NEE seems as if its obligatory duty is to take the throne of the renewable market (if you're for some reason doubting it even slightly)

# TLDR: EZ CASHFLOW, ECO-CONSCIOUS, and *bigly* expansion with tax credits incoming to help assist.

# Prelude

I own 100 shares. This is no advice to invest. Do your own DD.

*ignore the +100%. f´ing boomers sold this shit in premarket.*

# TLDR:

Company established a groundbreaking drug, Voclosporin. It has many benefits (more efficent, orally given, less side affects). They have the patent until 2037(!). The company expects 65K$ per patient - at least 200K patients in the US \* how many are actually treated = 1.3B $. They have 400M $ cash on hand + an aggreement for licensing the drug in Japan + EU for 100M $ + various milestone payments + 10-20% of revenue.

In total:

1.8B $ alone for the first year in the US, 1.3B $ is recurring revenue + 10-20% of revenue once EU/Japan approve the drug. Market cap? Only 2.3B $ Buyout? CEO and Chairman are open for it + have created comps which were bought out in the past by major pharm players.

enough DD was posted before, however the development of the share price shows the market does not evaluate this company at a fair price.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

# Establishing Voclosporin

SLE ( Systemic Lupus Ery. ) is an autoimmune disease. Various stages, various form. One of the worst is Lupus Nephrithis. In this form the functional units of the kidney, the nephrons, are attack by the bodies own immune system. The functions of the kidney fall off a cliff. Untreated the diagnosis is death.

[pretty shit to suffer from this](https://preview.redd.it/fgxut51hfmd61.png?width=1595&format=png&auto=webp&s=34e84cdf5ae2653cb1053711f60794d68bded1fe)

Current SoC / standard of care is the major use of steroids and using drugs to depress the immunesystem. This SoC is pretty shit as it is suboptimal and only helps few ppl improve. The target according to guidelines is:

*TLDR: decrease the secretion of protein*

Enter Voclosporin / Le blockbuster

It is a member of the Cyclosporin fam - so called calcineurin inhibitors. As I had to suffer through human physiology in this semster: they inhibite this molecule which turns on various immunological pathways.

[Major improvement over SoC](https://preview.redd.it/brjsgsd4hmd61.png?width=1589&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcac22951f0aa7192b12a03708876f93555a5aba)

3x as many patients benefit from this drug. But how good is it?

Very f´ing good fellow retard

With Voclosporin they are faster (only need 50% of the time), better, can be used on more classes of LN, can cut down on steroids and all it takes is a pill.

[Summary](https://preview.redd.it/pv3bwk6simd61.png?width=1591&format=png&auto=webp&s=eca3b153dc28f53de9c6a12f41fcfe3a7a609953)

Real nice - but how do they launch this thing in a pandemic?

They have been prepared for the liftoff. They boost a variety of people to influence all parameters of the equation: physicians, patients and insurance

# Tendies

The company owns the IP until 2037. This is incredibly bullish. Only one competitor exists: Benelysta by GSK (actually GSK bought the comp and did not develop it themself). They are inferior in every aspect + it´s not an orally given pill but and injection - yikes.

The *CEO was kinda retetarded* during the webcast yesterday. Well he had to be. So this part is a bit hard.

As LN is a rare disease the number of ppl affected is only roughly known. Therefore yesterday was kinda shit with the analysts as they were expecting a precise number on the revenue. The CEO was only able to provide the lower bound on the revenue.

https://preview.redd.it/brsuo5yrmmd61.png?width=1586&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cc001092a8a0c5e773f683b42169b4eeabe3503

AUPH provides patients with the pills package - called a wallet. This wallet contains around 60 pills. The patient takes 6 pills daily - i.e. this package lasts 10 days. Now here I´m a bit retarded BUT the CEO said they price the wallet to be 65K $ meaning a patient will receive the drug for 30 days will net the comp around 3x 65K. However the slides say 65K $ so I´ll leave it at that. => 65K $ per patient

Now, conservative estimates for the number of ppl suffering from LN is 200K - 300K. In my TLDR section I already did some math to figure out that the combination of those low estimates yields around 1.3B $ in revenue. 65K \* 200K \* actually treated patients = 1.3B

Add the 400M $ cash on hand + the licensing agreements and we have around 1.9B $ while the market cap is only 2.3B $. Once the real numbers and not just the low estimates are starting to pile up they will improve the share price.

This disease affects women and people from ""minority populations"" more often. These groups are the prime target of political actions taken by the progressive politicans.

Having this disease be common in those populations the real number of patients to be treated may be higher. On a humanitarian note, ""minority populations"" suffering from a disease and society not giving a damn is pretty bad."|2021-01-26 16:27:08.822090|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_162708.csv|StockTicker|['A', 'GME']|['A', 'GME']|['TLDR', '$AUPH', 'I', 'DD', 'K', 'US', 'B', 'M', 'EU', 'M', 'B', 'US', 'B', 'B', 'CEO', 'D', 'ST', 'W', 'DD', 'SLE', 'C', 'C', 'I', 'LN', 'IP', 'GSK', 'GSK', 'CEO', 'LN', 'CEO', 'AUPH', 'BUT', 'CEO', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'LN', 'K', 'K', 'TLDR', 'I', 'B', 'K', 'K', 'B', 'M', 'B', 'B']|['AUPH', 'I', 'DD', 'K', 'B', 'M', 'M', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'CEO', 'D', 'ST', 'W', 'DD', 'C', 'C', 'I', 'IP', 'GSK', 'GSK', 'CEO', 'CEO', 'AUPH', 'CEO', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'K', 'I', 'B', 'K', 'K', 'B', 'M', 'B', 'B']

First off Chamath Palipitiya has meme god status coming to him. We all know it.

Earlier this month renowned billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya brought Clover Health public through a SPAC. This was part of his SPAC series which he plans to revolutionize funding to companies. Clover Health is poised to change the way we see healthcare because of their use of Artificial Intelligence. They plan to use AI to discover high risk patients before complications arise to provide them with the best care possible. Sort of like Precogs from the minority report.

Father Chamath believes there are many things that make CLOV special. The main one being that it is undervalues Chamath has said that he believes the valuation to lie between 20-30 billion dollars while it is currently in the few billion stage. He likened it to Virgin Galactics SPCE. This is because people weren't able to grasp the concept of space travel going mainstream, he says the same realization is bound to hit Clover Health. This company is more of a technology company which allows it gain a great amount of investor support and funding. One of these investors which backed the startup was Alphabet - ""Google"".

Financials wise CLOV is still kicking ass. Clover was able to increase their revenue to close to 50%  in the past year. The IPO has only given it more money to increase infrastructure across America. They are currently located in 7 states of which 34 counties are effectively taken over. This allows the company a huge rate and area of growth to flesh into. 

As always do your own DD before hoping aboard.
