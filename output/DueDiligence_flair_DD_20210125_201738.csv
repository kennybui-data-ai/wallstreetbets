# The new BlackBerry

When suddenly the BlackBerry and Amazon partnership was announced on December 1st, 2020, most people were shocked (other than those who have been following the story), to learn that BlackBerry “the Phone Company” was still around. Soon they all realized that the phone company from back in the day has now transformed itself into a Software Security Company using AI and Machine Learning.

Once a pioneer in smartphone technology, is now pioneering the technology of the future. AI, ML, EV, AV, 5G, WFH, UEM, UES, EPP, MTD, EDR, UEBA, Zero Trust, Zero Touch, Crisis Communications, Cloud and more.

Remember even though BlackBerry has transformed from a hardware company to a software company the technology it developed is still in use today on mobile phones. BlackBerry owns a ton of patents due to being a pioneer in the smartphone business. Some of us don’t realize this but the work email you get on your iPhone, Android Phone, laptop or desktop (Mac or Windows) is secured by BlackBerry.

# 2021 Catalysts for Blackberry

One catalyst is that a deal was made with BlackBerry and Amazon's Web Services which will develop and market BlackBerry’s intelligent-vehicle-data platform – called Ivy – to help automakers create in-vehicle services.

The first BlackBerry device, the 850, was introduced in 1999 as a two-way pager in Munich. 

Blackberry also has partnership deals with Zoom, OnwardMobility and Huawei.

* Blackberry and Amazon: On Dec. 1, Blackberry announced it had partnered with Amazon Web Services to develop and bring to market BlackBerry’s Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. Automakers [will be able to use the software for the smart and autonomous electric vehicles](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/12/aws-and-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform) being developed.
* Blackberry and Zoom: On Oct. 16, Blackberry announced it was partnering with Zoom. Zoom will be using Blackberry’s [Blackberry Dynamics cybersecurity software](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-and-zoom-together-secure-your-virtual-enterprise-meetings) in its mobile platform to protect companies from cyberattacks and data breaches. Blackberry Dynamics software also provides secure video conferencing, which Blackberry says will become more necessary as companies move away from in-person meetings.  
* Blackberry and Huawei: Earlier this month,[ it was reported ](https://www.androidheadlines.com/2021/01/blackberry-key-smartphone-patents-huawei.html)that Blackberry had sold 90 patents to Chinese telecommunications company Huawei. Blackberry holds more patents than any other company in Canada, many that are applicable to smartphones that Blackberry no longer will concentrate on. 
* Blackberry and OnwardMobility: Despite Blackberry moving away from smartphones, last August Blackberry announced it would be partnering with OnwardMobility to help the tech startup produce Blackberry-branded smartphones with 5G technology. The phones are set to be released in[ the first half of this year](https://www.onwardmobility.com/about/).

# Blackberry,  SpaceX, and Blade Urban Air Mobility (ARK Investments)

SpaceX is using Blackberry QNX technology. It’s also expected that Blade Urban Air Mobility (EXPC) is also using Blackberry QNX technology in their flying machines. I expect by the year 2025 there will be over 75 billion devices with QNX worldwide.

One should also note that Cathie Wood's Ark Invest started a position in Blade Urban Air Mobility's SPAC called Experience Investment (EXPC).

\**Can't post pic because retard bot will delete it, go check ARKQ yourself*.

# My reason to believe Blackberry goes back to $65 or even $100+

Space sector is getting hot every day, Elon Musk is looking to take Starlink public, I see Blackberry playing a role in this since SpaceX already uses Blackberry's QNC technology. The same thing can be said about Blade Urban Air Mobility.

Blackberry QNC will become Space's real time operating system, this is just the beginning just like how Blackberry engineered Mobile devices, they will be the leader (the glue) in IoT and real time analytics.

TLDR: BUY, moon soon!
