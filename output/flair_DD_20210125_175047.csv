0,Why Iâ€™m Holding GME and why you should too.,0.96,5740,5740,Mon Jan 25 21:20:06 2021,SuperCoolHoolaPool,1032,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4tu4r/why_im_holding_gme_and_why_you_should_too/,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4tu4r/why_im_holding_gme_and_why_you_should_too/,"Listen up retards youâ€™ve heard it over and over, If GME is at a price of $115 or above by this Friday (IMO very likely as the amount of bullish volume keeps increasing) then it triggers the Gamma short squeeze. This ticker will go up 1000% and thatâ€™s the truth of the matter. Do you really wanna be the paper handed bitch that sells for a -10,-20,-30%+ loss right before it launches? Well good, step aside and let the men trade. While your portfolioâ€™s bleeding out from all those paper cuts the real men will hold the bag with 
ðŸ’ŽðŸ¤š raking in those 1000+% gains. 

Positions: 15 shares @ 72.55, 8 shares @ 89.5"
