(before reading, note that they are reporting earnings on the morning of the 26th, I will be taking advantage of the IV crush to open a LEAP position)

To start, I see an awful amount of praise for ETF's when playing this sector. However, while ETF's offer greater security in individual investments, the true risk and reward of playing this sector becomes apparent through the lens of comparison. The three ETF's I concentrated on for this DD are:

* **ICLN**
* **TAN**
* **FAN**

While these are all popular, none of them have weighted NEE anywhere near its capitalization potential. Just the next two years alone will nearly certainly double the stock's market cap. They have over $50B in infrastructure investments planned through 2022, and you can be assured that they will have an advantage to this [in the form of tax credits and subsidies.](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/nee-stock-is-ready-to-soar-under-green-biden-administration/)

That's right, Uncle Sam is going to skullfuck this company with tax credits and subsidies to the point that this thing could have a TSLA-esque potential. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, how does this company look when lined up among some competition?

The particular interest with NEE is that they seemingly do it all. This shit is like the Chic-Fil-A of the energy sector. It could honestly not give less of a shit about saving the world, its only focus is cash flow, which in terms that WSB is accustomed to, is just fuel reserves for its inevitable moon mission. I analyzed 3 different companies in the renewable energy sector, and those were

1. Plug Power
   1. slowing of net income in Q/Q growth.
2. Enphase
   1. already boomed. the party for this one got busted pretty fast. imo just a shitty boomer pick
3. First Solar
   1. This one is a legitimate competitor in my view. 
   2. I would honestly invest in this if its revenue sources were more diverse.

So taking these into account, NEE seems as if its obligatory duty is to take the throne of the renewable market (if you're for some reason doubting it even slightly)

# TLDR: EZ CASHFLOW, ECO-CONSCIOUS, and *bigly* expansion with tax credits incoming to help assist.

# Prelude

I own 100 shares. This is no advice to invest. Do your own DD.

https://preview.redd.it/4hz60wztpmd61.png?width=1205&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8ef4ae2922b744416796b67d4b3a3093a37e3f7

*ignore the +100%. fÂ´ing boomers sold this shit in premarket.*

# TLDR:

Company established a groundbreaking drug, Voclosporin. It has many benefits (more efficent, orally given, less side affects). They have the patent until 2037(!). The company expects 65K$ per patient - at least 200K patients in the US \* how many are actually treated = 1.3B $. They have 400M $ cash on hand + an aggreement for licensing the drug in Japan + EU for 100M $ + various milestone payments + 10-20% of revenue.

In total:

1.8B $ alone for the first year in the US, 1.3B $ is recurring revenue + 10-20% of revenue once EU/Japan approve the drug. Market cap? Only 2.3B $ Buyout? CEO and Chairman are open for it + have created comps which were bought out in the past by major pharm players.

enough DD was posted before, however the development of the share price shows the market does not evaluate this company at a fair price.

ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

# Establishing Voclosporin

SLE ( Systemic Lupus Ery. ) is an autoimmune disease. Various stages, various form. One of the worst is Lupus Nephrithis. In this form the functional units of the kidney, the nephrons, are attack by the bodies own immune system. The functions of the kidney fall off a cliff. Untreated the diagnosis is death.

[pretty shit to suffer from this](https://preview.redd.it/fgxut51hfmd61.png?width=1595&format=png&auto=webp&s=34e84cdf5ae2653cb1053711f60794d68bded1fe)

Current SoC / standard of care is the major use of steroids and using drugs to depress the immunesystem. This SoC is pretty shit as it is suboptimal and only helps few ppl improve. The target according to guidelines is:

*TLDR: decrease the secretion of protein*

Enter Voclosporin / Le blockbuster

It is a member of the Cyclosporin fam - so called calcineurin inhibitors. As I had to suffer through human physiology in this semster: they inhibite this molecule which turns on various immunological pathways.

[Major improvement over SoC](https://preview.redd.it/brjsgsd4hmd61.png?width=1589&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcac22951f0aa7192b12a03708876f93555a5aba)

3x as many patients benefit from this drug. But how good is it?

Very fÂ´ing good fellow retard

With Voclosporin they are faster (only need 50% of the time), better, can be used on more classes of LN, can cut down on steroids and all it takes is a pill.

Real nice - but how do they launch this thing in a pandemic?

They have been prepared for the liftoff. They boost a variety of people to influence all parameters of the equation: physicians, patients and insurance

# Tendies

The company owns the IP until 2037. This is incredibly bullish. Only one competitor exists: Benelysta by GSK (actually GSK bought the comp and did not develop it themself). They are inferior in every aspect + itÂ´s not an orally given pill but and injection - yikes.

The *CEO was kinda retetarded* during the webcast yesterday. Well he had to be. So this part is a bit hard.

As LN is a rare disease the number of ppl affected is only roughly known. Therefore yesterday was kinda shit with the analysts as they were expecting a precise number on the revenue. The CEO was only able to provide the lower bound on the revenue.

https://preview.redd.it/brsuo5yrmmd61.png?width=1586&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cc001092a8a0c5e773f683b42169b4eeabe3503

AUPH provides patients with the pills package - called a wallet. This wallet contains around 60 pills. The patient takes 6 pills daily - i.e. this package lasts 10 days. Now here IÂ´m a bit retarded BUT the CEO said they price the wallet to be 65K $ meaning a patient will receive the drug for 30 days will net the comp around 3x 65K. However the slides say 65K $ so IÂ´ll leave it at that. => 65K $ per patient

Now, conservative estimates for the number of ppl suffering from LN is 200K - 300K. In my TLDR section I already did some math to figure out that the combination of those low estimates yields around 1.3B $ in revenue. 65K \* 200K \* actually treated patients = 1.3B

Add the 400M $ cash on hand + the licensing agreements and we have around 1.9B $ while the market cap is only 2.3B $. Once the real numbers and not just the low estimates are starting to pile up they will improve the share price.

This disease affects women and people from ""minority populations"" more often. These groups are the prime target of political actions taken by the progressive politicans.

Having this disease be common in those populations the real number of patients to be treated may be higher. On a humanitarian note, ""minority populations"" suffering from a disease and society not giving a damn is pretty bad."|2021-01-26 16:27:08.822090|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_162708.csv|StockTicker

First off Chamath Palipitiya has meme god status coming to him. We all know it.

Earlier this month renowned billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya brought Clover Health public through a SPAC. This was part of his SPAC series which he plans to revolutionize funding to companies. Clover Health is poised to change the way we see healthcare because of their use of Artificial Intelligence. They plan to use AI to discover high risk patients before complications arise to provide them with the best care possible. Sort of like Precogs from the minority report.

Father Chamath believes there are many things that make CLOV special. The main one being that it is undervalues Chamath has said that he believes the valuation to lie between 20-30 billion dollars while it is currently in the few billion stage. He likened it to Virgin Galactics SPCE. This is because people weren't able to grasp the concept of space travel going mainstream, he says the same realization is bound to hit Clover Health. This company is more of a technology company which allows it gain a great amount of investor support and funding. One of these investors which backed the startup was Alphabet - ""Google"".

Financials wise CLOV is still kicking ass. Clover was able to increase their revenue to close to 50%  in the past year. The IPO has only given it more money to increase infrastructure across America. They are currently located in 7 states of which 34 counties are effectively taken over. This allows the company a huge rate and area of growth to flesh into. 

As always do your own DD before hoping aboard.

Positions: OTM Calls into next year."|2021-01-26 16:27:08.822090|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_162708.csv|StockTicker
