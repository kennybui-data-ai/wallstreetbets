We all remember when he complained that shorting should be illegal, and when he released ‚Äúshort shorts‚Äù when he finally defeated them. 

But guess who used to brag about shorting Tesla? Gabe üåàüêª Plotkin. 

From [Bloomberg:](https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2019-07-19/cohen-cub-gabriel-plotkin-sees-fund-surge-about-44-this-year)

Plotkin described Melvin as ‚Äúa very human-intensive place. We have a lot of analysts, we require a lot out of them.‚Äù The team has modeled more than 500 companies in ‚Äúsignificant detail,‚Äù while a data science group reads into trends.
He added that the firm has an ‚Äúintense focus‚Äù on the short side, with about 70% of profits in Melvin‚Äôs first year coming from bearish bets. Plotkin expressed skepticism about mall real estate investment trusts, as well as electric-car maker Tesla Inc.

$GME to the üåö, then profits back to a safe store of value: $TSLA.

Not only did they not account for the tsunami of smooth-brains YOLOing FD's, (spearheaded by big dick big brain ape kings like DFV) they're going bankrupt for it.

From this day forth, every hedgefund (especially ones that short) will have to account for the Retard Factor ‚Ñ¢. There will always be the risk of the Robinhood Autists taking their Little Johns to tendietown!

This is a big moment. A tug of war between tradition and the future.

Hedge fund managers live in the past, and continue to look down upon the retail investors. They truly believe that we, the average retail investors, don't know anything about finances or the market (which may be true), and we're just gambling our money away.

We don't know any better. WE NEED HEDGE FUND MANAGERS TO TELL US WHAT TO DO! SAVE US!

This is the world they want to live in. This was the past.

Remember that scene from the Sopranos, where Tony's wife calls to buy 5000 shares of Webonics, after she was manipulated emotionally to so?  Institutions and hedge funds want us to be stuck in that world.

They're scared of the future.

They're scared because, so much information is available for free now. THere's no more fees for trading. We have large communities that discuss stocks and trading openly.

We can think and make decisions for ourselves, which scares the FUCK out of old school institutions and hedge funds.

Fuck them all. This affects every single one of you, whether or not you're holding $GME.

TLDR: Fuck hedge funds. This is a crosspoint into the future.

* During this time, GME increased $46.95 (from $17.9 to $64.85). **AKA for every $11.95 increase in GME price, Melvin loses $1bn.**

GME price as I am writing this is $103.46. That means:

Some didn't make it at all. My friend's husband passed away due to covid, she lost her job and now she's alone with two kids and swimming in debt. 

I've tried to help everyone as much as possible but it just wasn't enough. My own business died during the lockdown as well but I was able to save up some cash.

Most of it is now I'm GME. I've bought shares for 20k at 120 average. If this rocket will fly over $1000 I'll be able to help these families get back on their feet (and the kids will be able to go back to dancing classes!).

Listen retards, I just wanted to let you know that by doing your part and holding, you're not just helping the whales get more yachts and mansions but you're also saving lives. Literally. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to do some good. 

Yours truly,

**Retail does not want to be manipulated anymore.**

For decades Wall Street was manipulating securities, getting away with it, and blaming it on others. Through the media, bullshit target prices, naked short selling, or other forms of manipulation mentioned [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_manipulation) (Kenneth, [this one](https://www.ft.com/content/16cee174-3b7f-11ea-b232-000f4477fbca)'s for you). Citadel and many other MMs - don't misinterpret with Market Makers, we're talking about Market Manipulators here - got away with their dirty tactics to make shitload of money and screw people over. They finally got caught in their own game and tried everything to turn it around, but Shitron didn't work, the media didn't work, more aggressive selling didn't work. Now they're calling through some random crooks for regulations.

**BULLSHIT.** Regulation for what? Exchange of ideas? Our own Due Diligence? Winning against you in your own game? Yeah, in most cases your buddies at the SEC would gladly do so if you tell them anyway. This time though? People finally came to the realisation what the fuck you guys are doing over there. It was known by many since 2008 but people forgot quickly, and now is the time to remind them that you are no one else's friend but your crooked buddies.

I never thought I'd say this, but this community showed more leadership and guidance than any other media network. Providing knowledge, research, answers, many of you proven that **you are better people** than these fuckers with billions of dollars of AUM. You should be proud of yourselves as you are leading an unprecedented event in the history of finance. **Unprecedented.** This is why you should still guide others and be an example. Of course, we are not an entity and we will never be - just remember that you are a part of something great, maybe something that will change the way financial world operates, in a smaller or larger way. Remember that there are sharks among us who got pissed at the dirty games as well (shoutout to you Elon & Chamath). We are not alone.

They blame us? Let's blame them. They will lose all credibility sooner than later, not to mention this incoming generation. The media is here now, you still might convince my 80-year old grandpa that the internet is something out of Pandora's Box, but soon enough you won't be able to convince a single person. We are an important source of information for many people, and I'm not talking about WSB, but about the people that make it. Let's go there in the world and spread the facts.

Hence, dear Market Manipulators:

***Do not mislead again. Do not manipulate again. Get your facts straight. Retail matters, and you will see it.*** "|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224307.csv|StockTicker

I am risking making a GME post after being banned for 3 days for making a GME post! Idk if the following will get me banned but here it goes...

Too many accounts with less than 10 post karma asking to set a sell limit at $1000! These are Melvin shill bots who know they can cover at $1000 from that juicy 2.5 billion loan that Citadel gave! Which means they see this sht flying to the magnitude of $30,000 or more! 

Do not fall for that lame $1000 price! GME is increasing 100% everyday and $1000 will be in 2 trading days! This is nothing! They are scared of those 30k price target! I‚Äôm setting sell my limit to 30k+ so when Melvin fks get margin called this Friday, they have to pay what ever the fk I‚Äôm selling for! 

And ban those accounts that are shilling the $1000 limit sell comments! They are everywhere! 

To the moooooon we gooooo!!! üöÄüöÄüöÄ

TLDR: 1000 is nothing. I‚Äôm putting my sell limit to $69,420

Edit: a lot of comment regarding how Melvin will be liquidated at $175. I don‚Äôt give a flying fuk about Melvin. I just used their names as they are the most popular GME short. I want all the fkers to go bankrupt. Shitron and what not. All 139% current shorts to cover. 
Let the greatest wealth transfer begin!

Edit 2: why have that jacked up high 69420 sell limit??? I thought it was obvious but seems it‚Äôs not so as a fellow user _Hamilton_ explains in the comments:

‚ÄúThis is legit. The whole point of the sell limit is to prevent your broker from lending out your shares to the likes of Melvin. $69,420 is much better than the $5000 I previously advocated.

Keep buying more shares from people who lend out their shares for shorting, and deny them to borrow your shares for their short scam scheme.

This means they have to cover as their current borrowed shares is no longer available. Just set it so high that they can't afford to buy'em. GME is tits up to the moon. Melvin Shitron will both go bankrupt as we write history. Oh, and they where bankrupted by a bunch of internet retards, this is their worst nightmare‚Äù."|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224307.csv|StockTicker

I think the large players are starting to realize they need to take the retards on reddit seriously. I think they're attempting to astroturf the investing subreddits by giving awards to tickers they have a vested interest in. And at this moment, that's anything that isn't GME. They know that once the prevailing enthusiasm subsides they'll have the opportunity to close.

Stay wary and stay vigilant my comrades. This is a war of attrition.

I asked my professors what they thought about wsb and they basically laughed us off as a bunch of idiots.

I am more than confident to say that a series of Whales have come to battle alongside with us retail shareholders. The Amount of volume and the amount of capital that was thrown at this stock today was nothing short of remarkable. The battle started at 11:01am EST, when the first short attack began, and the stock was able to find the floor at about $97.02. What followed was absolutely mind blowing.

For the next nearly two hours there was a series of extremely systematic buying. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that the whales have come to our aid. If you look at the chart below you will see that every 45 minutes there is a short attack of some sort and that attack is was denied every single time. Now I am not doubting at all in the strenght of out community, but the only folks out there with this much capital are other insitututions that want in on this historical event.

That's right I beleive at this time the Rohirrim has arrived lead by a mass of insitutional investors that want a slice of that 2.75 Billion dollar bail out. And they are willing to shell out at premium prices to bleed Melvin Capital Dry. There is still 30 minutes left in this session, lets just see how this plays out.

This is just an observation with rough hypothesis based on today's oberserved trading activity and is not advice.

EDIT: Just a Quick Update

[The BALLS on the trade desks of these firms. They all must have custom Hagar Pants being made in a spare office on the daily.](https://preview.redd.it/3ekdo813rqd61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcc42e0badc92f6e84af4435805fdc7eebc1bea3)

Looks like according to Level two trading, there is a significant ""Sell Wall"" at $150 for about 54k shares. So there is going to need to be some significant volume to push through that level, which is completely possible at the open.

A bunch of Asperger's, WoW playing, poor ""kids"" managed to cause an epic squeeze in $GME. Make no mistake you have the attention of the big boys NOW.

&nbsp;

Now an absolute giant in the hedge fund world has gotten in, and it is against WSB. Ken Griffin (he has a camera in his office that shows his luxury car collection in the garage) may not be a name you know, but he is  a HUGE name in the hedge and quant fund world. After today and likely tomorrow, he is at risk of losing 2 Billion plus in his fund. I repeat he will NOT let this happen.

&nbsp;

These are the type of guys who do insider trading for fun at their country club. They front run clients, put out fake news stories, have direct links to the SEC board, and would literally murder everyone in here to increase their personal wealth.

&nbsp;


**What to expect  from them next:**


1. Convince (strongarm) the SEC to completely HALT trading on GME. They will make up a bullshit excuse, and force the exchange to stop allowing trades on the stock.

2. Hire big name attorneys, and force reddit to shut down WSB   
3. Pressure $GME executives to issue NEW shares at this price, and bail the shorts out. This is pretty easy for them to do. You have to understand almost all the people at this level of wealth know each other. Its a small club. 

&nbsp;



**What can you do to stop this:**

1. Bring attention to their tactics via going to the media (Twitter, NYT, Senator Elizabeth Warren or the like)

2. File SEC complaints that show that NAKED short selling is happening on GME, and is creating an actual organic move. There are more shares SHORT than their are FLOAT (traded in every day trading). This means if they covered their shorts they would have to buy every single share outstanding, and another 30% that are not actively traded.

And was asked to post this as a discussion.

The most important thing is actually **until Friday there** will be another **price** battle in which the short sellers will try to keep as many calls as possible outside the price so that they cannot be executed and the broker does not have to buy them on the market to cover them .  
It is particularly critical because **monthly and weekly calls** expire, as far as I know the highest monthly call was **60c 1/29** and **115c 1/29** (left out the new 200c).

The MM will try everything to push the course **below 60** , **our goal to get to 115** . Until then, **expect massive short attacks** , it will probably be even more blatant than yesterday. Since a price limit is harder to keep higher up, don't be surprised if there is a red tag up until then or the lower limit is 60-80.  
For those of you who don't know what is meant, 100xLimit orders at $ 60 are $ 6000 <$ 11500 100x at $ 115 and easier to hold or buy from autistic people.

And almost most importantly **, put your stop loss out** , the **shortsellers try** to trigger as many as possible with their short sales in order to trigger **a chain reaction of panic selling** .

Remember **yesterday we saw exactly that** , price dumping at its finest, although almost no short position was powered.

Should we be **able to hold the $ 115 by Friday** , the banks (! Not the shortsellers) would have to buy an additional 8 million shares to cover the demand for the calls. To achieve this there is really only the possibility üöÄ‚úãüèªüíéü§öüèª,

**Don't be a paper bitch!**

All figures relate to estimates and information or assumptions and observations from DD from here and the Angelsachen forum. Due to the high trading volume, it is not possible to say how the share is currently distributed !!

**This is not a financial advice, but an autistic one.** **Always invest wisely and make your own decisions.**

And now relax America won't open for another 4 hours anyway.

Keeping holding and relax.**

With a lot of chatter going around and some excellent DD being shared with lots of technical analysis there still seems to be doubt as to 1) If the squeeze is happening, and 2) How to capitalize on it.  Please spend a few minutes reading this so you're more informed as a trader (even if this is your first time being a trader).  This is not a technical analysis but more a plain English guide:

1. **Crazy price volatility:** I think this one is self-explanatory but if you're wondering what price volatility looks like go check out a Google chart from the past week or so.  A stock moving up 20%+ day after day after day is not typical.
2. **Those who stand to lose the most go on the offensive:** At this point it is fairly well established that WSB has many user accounts being used for a variety of purposes, but at the moment many of those accounts are trying to drum up emotional responses to counter the short squeeze.  People hyping new tickers with far less short-term upside, saying that the facts are not true (remember kids: you're entitled to opinions but not your own facts).
3. **Those who stand to lose are taking MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR life lines:** Again, this so self-explanatory but yet still not all of us believe that a squeeze is happening.  During the 2008/2009 crash there were MAJOR US BANKS that were getting $2-5BN in bailout money to prevent the entire economy from collapsing.  Yesterday a relatively small hedge fund posing ZERO systemic risk took a $2.75BN bailout that without it would have likely seen them disappear from the system with ZERO impact to our greater economy as a whole.
4. **Confusion:** Have you noticed that some of the ""smartest guys in the room"" can't seem to agree on television and in the media as to what is going on??  If you actually believe that there is some debate going on amongst the experienced and elite Wall Street types then there may be no hope for you in life.  Con artists prey on the gullible and you will be a slaughtered sheep soon.
5. **Just f-ing hold if you like money!!:** If the above four bullet points haven't convinced you then nothing will so just sit back, relax, and let the men do our work.  If your wrists get weak and your paper hands get so feeble that you sell at these low prices then we (the real men of this sub) are better off without you owning the stock anyway.  AND STOP BUYING OPTIONS YOU STUPID IDIOTS! Calls were great to have bought in 2019, even into mid-to-late 2020, but the price you're paying for them now is a rip-off.  AND, the volatility on the price means your chances of losing money have never been better!

Warren Buffett has famously said at multiple shareholder meetings that he doesn't want people owning Berkshire stock if they're the type of *investor* that trades in and out of positions.  He wants long-holders, people that believe in the mission of the company, believe in the management, and want to get wealthy, NOT RICH.

**You might be in the middle of something that will not happen to you again EVER in your investing life, or perhaps only a handful of times from now until you retire.  Don't screw it up by thinking that jumping off the fastest moving train, and one that is unique and a statistical anomaly, is going to happen again on some other ticker that has gotten the unfortunate meme status that the elite are trying to trick you into right now.**

NOK, BB, and others may all go up in the future and if you want to invest in them then you should wait.  How long??  Who knows.  And who cares?!?!?  You're probably in your 20's or even teens, you have plenty of time to invest in many good companies in your lifetime but quite likely NONE will go through this kind of movement over a period of a few weeks and if you sell now (you paper handed p-ssy) you will never forgive yourself.  HOLD, be patient, let the shorts bleed themselves to death, and in the meantime go focus on something other than Reddit!

Good luck to all.

***EDIT: I somehow forgot to add positions.  In keeping with the suggestion of others not to broadcast exact holdings (don't show the enemies your positions!) I will just say I have a high six-figure position of SHARES ONLY and I haven't even thought about selling for a moment.  This is not my biggest holding and my life won't be changed whether it eventually settles at $50/share or $500/share and YOURS WON'T EITHER SO BE STRONG.***

***EDIT II: Stop calling it a ""Loss"" if you bought at $X and it is now below $X.  An actual loss has not occurred until AFTER you sell, and if you don't sell then you won't lose.  It is not more complicated than that.  Seasoned investors (which are on the other side of every trade that you do) rely on you being emotional because they are using a computer with no emotion at all.  Don't be the sucker and don't actually lose money when instead you could actually have a gain!***"|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224307.csv|StockTicker

NOK sells for less than 5$, the cheap price appeals to retailers (retards) in the same way PLTR and GME's less than 30$ a share did for those who cant afford TSLA. I mean you can buy 100 stocks of NOK for less than 500$. think about that. the perfect distraction.

1:  NOK is an NEM. do you know who else is an NEM, Huawei, Ericsson, ZTE. hell even Samsung has aggressivly entered the market a couple of years ago and are strongly positioning themselves especially after Trump banned ZTE and Huawei.
these NEMs are called HENZ (Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia, ZTE) then changed to HENS as samsung grabbed ZTE by their banned balls. all these guys have been involved heavily in 5G. I know that from my 5G centric company.
EDIT: by centric I mean F500 at the heart of the 5G ecosystem.

2: most of the first world is almost done with 5G. yes infrastructure wise done. Im not talking about Zimbabwe (even though Huawei is clear winner in africa btw). 
btw for U.S smooth brains who cant think about the rest of the world, Verizon invested a lot in their 5G infrastructure and towers already, the best in NOT yet to come, it has already been done. AT&T are 90% done, they did a gay way in which all they need is a software update to switch to 5G from LTE. yes there is still a lot of money to be made in 5G market, but thats for full layer solutions, including application layer. I kid you not but people especially in the wireless infrastructure are looking at 6G now... *cough* samsung *cough*

3: NOK is a good company for INVESTING LONG TERM.  they have been early adapters for 5G in their strategy initiative and their execution plan. but that was just the necessarily of growth and survival. lol.of course they got in 5G! what else would they have done. it is the same way how they are going to get in 6G as well and 7G later... you smooth brains saying ""WoW 5G!"" is like looking at a house flipper guy by profession, who buys houses then flips them and sells them, and you retard say, this guy must be on the moon cause he keeps buying houses! well no shit idiots its what they do.

listen, I like NOK, great guys. but dont be fucking retards falling for the bots and implants by MM and melvin capital. NOK isnt going to moon. they are going to steadily grow so take that shit back to r/investing.

**April 2020** \- Long story short, I started in April 2020 right after COVID, whereby I got introduced to some 'gurus'/paid courses to learn basic options strategies. Bought calls on everything tech, FB, AMD, SE, NVDA, PTON, FSLY, etc, etc. Started to find that ""money was so easy to make"" and even took out bank loans.

**August 2020** \- Indices rally all day everyday, stonks only go up, earnings always beat and stonks rally, made $175k in only 3/4 months.

**September 2020** \- Crashed hard for 3 days, and due to poor risk management with absolutely ZERO take profit / stop losses, watched ALL my tech calls bleed into oblivion. Profit got wiped out and I was literally back at breakeven. Wasted 4/5 months of my time, had no job, and was in debt. Went into semi-depression.

**October 2020** \- Figured I had to find get my money back, all I needed was just ONE good play to go all-in, and I would recover. Or at least that's what I told myself. Found this guy NoProblemChanging who seemed to be really accurate at predicting the markets - literally followed the advice of a stranger on WSB and went all in on puts due to his bearish views and certainty that the market was going to crash.

**November 2020** \- As we all know, everyone was expecting elections to be a shitshow but vaccine news rallied the markets with multiple gap ups and stuff. **By now I was already down $100k and was depressed. Imagine having made easy money ($175k in 4 months) in the greatest bull market of all time, only to lose it all in 3 days and even going negative, while seeing every stonk around me go up everyday while my puts bled all day. Not going to lie, at this moment I felt like $ROPEing although logically I know $100k is money that can still be earned back.**

I was so desperate at this moment that I HAD to find something that I could ALL IN and GUARANTEED to make money. Then, I found $GME. I found u/DeepFuckingValue and that's when I climbed into the rabbit hole, knowing it was a fundamentally undervalued company. Bought around $15\~. Huge credit to GMEShortSqueeze and u/Uberkikz11 as well.

**December 2020** \- By this time, I was pretty much already all in $GME but I hedged with CCs / sold some of my calls WAY TOO EARLY. **To put it into perspective, if I didn't touch my positions at all until today, I would have been around $3m, but as of now I'm only around $1.4m. Regardless, I am grateful!**

**January 2021** \- I've joined the 2 comma club officially! Finally hit my milestone.

**TLDR; made easy money on the rally after COVID in 4 months, lost it all in 3 days due to poor risk management and even went negative, briefly experienced depression and felt like $ROPEing, found a good company $GME, went all in with conviction, emerged stronger than ever.  üíéüôå  üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ  üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ  If I can do it, so can you.**

I hope the dip doesn‚Äôt happen and we fly. But don‚Äôt be complacent. Be ready for the dip and press forward. I personally am holding till I have no fucking idea. $1k+? And I am fully prepared to buy the mother fucking dip. Rest up soldiers, the real battle begins tomorrow.

When someone thinks a stock is going to go down or a company will go bankrupt, they can borrow shares from their broker to open a ""short"" position.  They then sell the shares immediately at the current market price.  They have a specified amount of time to return the borrowed shares to the brokerage.

If the stock does go down, the investor buys that number of shares at the now lower current market price, and then returns them to the broker.  He/she keeps the difference.

If the stock goes up, they have to ""cover"" their position.  They can ""buy-to-close"" whenever they want, but many of them will wait for a very long time because they are large firms who have a lot of money and leeway with their brokerage.  However, if a stock keeps going up and up, the brokerages can call the investor and demand the shares back to hedge *their* losses.  This forced buying drives the price up even more, which then causes other brokerages to make the same phone call to their clients, and so on and so forth.  This is called a ""short squeeze"".

\---

GameStop is a declining brick-and-mortar video game retailer.  Their management has not adapted to the digital world where many video games are downloaded instead of on discs.  They have been making some moves in the right direction, such as closing underperforming stores and paying down some debt, but they need to reinvent themselves to succeed.  Many large investors/firms have seen this coming and took out short positions a few years ago.  The stock kept going down so the brokerages and banks hadn't called yet. GME is the most-heavily shorted stock on the market.  More shares are shorted than are in circulation.  It's called ""naked short selling"", it's complicated, and some of it is probably illegal but the SEC looks away.

[Ryan Cohen](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890) founded Chewy.com when he was 25 and sold it six or so years later for $3.5 billion.  Last August, he purchased 9% of GME's shares.  When it was disclosed in the SEC filings, the stock went up 22% in a day (which is a LOT in normal circumstances).  The thought being that he was going to attempt to take over the company.  There was a lot of speculation online.  In late November he wrote a [strongly-worded letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf) to the Board of Directors.

Shortly before Christmas, he disclosed that he had bought more shares and now owns 12.9% of the company.  He bought the new shares at $16ish, after buying the first batch around $4.  When someone owns 10% or more of a company, there are heavy limitations on how much they can sell at one time, in a given period, and they have to disclose everything.

This signaled that he wasn't in it for a quick buck and he probably really was going to try to take over and modernize the entire company.  Gamestop has something like 55 million members in their club/newsletter thing, and that data can be used to make a lot of money through targeted advertising and such.   There have also been confirmed rumors that the company will be making a serious run at the fast-growing PC gaming market (many serious gamers build their own computers).  Video game competitions are also very popular and can be capitalized on.  The stock continued to slowly climb, with some sell-offs and such along the way.  It was not for the faint of heart.

Fast-forward to January 10th, when it was announced that Cohen and two of his board members from Chewy were officially appointed to the GameStop Board.  It was really looking like the theories from last fall were correct.  The news sent the stock soaring and the investors who had short positions were in big trouble.  Some of them started covering their debt, but many didn't and still haven't. The ones that did have incurred losses in the collective billions, and there are many more billions still out there that will be lost by short investors.

For the past two weeks, the pro-GameStop investors have shown great interest in the potential turnaround story of a store that plays a big role in their childhood memories.  With the presence of Cohen and his buddies from Chewy, an e-commerce giant, small investors can see that GameStop is now undervalued to those who believe in the new Board members.

The stock has been incredibly volatile as the large investment firms try to drive the price down.  One way they can do this by opening massive new short positions (AKA selling large chunks of shares all at once) as other shorts return their borrowed shares to the pool.  This can be seen many times along the daily charts of GME, in nearly vertical declines.  Knowing the potential of both Cohen and the short squeeze, small investors have been buying up all the dips.  If the shares are being held, and not sold, they are unavailable to be returned to brokerages. This drives the price up even MORE as the short investors scramble to buy whatever shares are available to fill their debt before the price continues to rise. Eventually someone is left holding the shares purchased at the highest possible price, but in this once-in-a-lifetime case, it probably won't be someone with a net worth under $100 million.

TLDR at the bottom.** 

This has come up a few times, so as a non-finance professional I want to offer some financial non-advice to anyone who has just come into a lot of money and is considering paying off their student loans right now. 

[RIGHT NOW FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS ARE FROZEN](https://studentloanhero.com/featured/student-loan-relief-extended/) until September. You aren't obligated to repay until then, and no interest is accruing. 

**PAYING OFF ZERO-INTEREST DEBT EARLY IS FUCKING STUPID.** 

That means you have until September to allow your money to keep growing, either by investing (obligatory all investments carry risk disclaimer), saving in a boomer CD, or saving in a boomer high-yield savings account. Even if my GME tendies only grew by $100 between now and then, it's still the better financial decision to grow my money and pay later than pay now.

AM I GETTING THROUGH TO YOU SMOOTH BRAINS?

Even if you have a private loan, if your interest rate is LOW ENOUGH (like less than 5%), some people (not me because I'm not a financial professional) might even say it's better to keep your money somewhere where it earns more interest, instead of paying off your loans in full. This is called interest arbitrage. 

Congratulations on all the new tendies! But for the love of god please don't be the bad kind of stupid.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Paying off zero-interest debt early is stupid as shit. Find a way to let your money continue to grow until payments resume in September.

**Great Expansion. /**

Since December, BB announced big surprises on the level of expansions of their company. 

7 December 2020 - We're talking about the co-development with **Amazon** of BlackBerry IVY,  a cloud-connected intelligent vehicle data platform.

25 January 2021 -  Partnership with **Baidu** of BlackBerry QNX, a software who's going to change the world of automobile. Used for a functional safety, a network security and reliability.  This announce about the creation of a good systems who can be implemted in every majors devices in long terms.

We're not talking about the OEM partners who are already with BlackBerry like **DELL** and **Infima**.

&#x200B;

**No Risk. /**

**192%** in **1 Month**, Looks alot if you see it this way. But is it really ?

Short Term - BlackBerry have an undervaluation for what it will come. The expansion of the company and the news who came since last year had a great impact. We think **192%** is a Pump and Dump, but the real answer is the road of 6$ to 19$ who is really small of what the company can really achieve. There is a large room to grow into in a short time if we think about the fact BB achieved **138$** in 2007. Why not 100$ ? They are still BlackBerry no ?

Medium Term - BlackBerry already announced 2 larges connections with giant companies in less than 2 months, they are ready for something or they need to make it big. That's where i want you to think, they will need to make the most connections in 2021 for installing their ''power'' in the market. Now we have BlackBerry who have a **100% success rate in safety and security certifications,** it will be a major change when it will be installed and known of every devices fabricants. And it will happen before 2022.

Long Term - The best one about me. We talk about BlackBerry, dealing additionnal co-operation with larges enterprise with the future already writed in their head. Their software and their utilisation worldwide will be not only huge, but attractive. The competition in this sector is old and not adjusted of what cyberattacks can come. BB already had the experiance of owning a large chunk of the market with Smartphones, do you really think it will be hard for them again ? Don't think 19 US$ is high if you think holding BlackBerry for years, it's a steal. literally.

&#x200B;

**BlackBerry Itself. /**

We're talking about the great expension BB has and about the international development of the software, but do you really know BlackBerry ?

Hacking, like this it looks not a big deal. But do you really know the impact it has ?

**12 May 2017** \- 80 Hospitals in England were affected by a Ransomware, writing patients on paper and pen

**July 2017** \- Equinax ,byberattack over **143 million American, Canadian and British customers** as well as **200,000 credit card numbers.** They had a simple vulnerability

**January 2021** \- Central Bank of New Zealand, security breach was found, 50 customers were affected. **20 YEARS OLD** software wasn't updated.

I could continue all night long about security software who are not updated or not enough fiable for today world. BlackBerry have, and will take, the advantage of making their presence in the market really soon, like we saw. What i really love about BlackBerry is that they don't stop innoving they product, they stopped working on their Smartphone for being full-time on what will come soon. They are extremely good in their domain and they will kill when coming in the market !

&#x200B;

BlackBerry re-invents itself, and you can join them.

&#x200B;

[I was one of the first to come out with a NOK DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l23du0/nokia_dd_one_way_trip_to_bonerville/) and I want you to listen closely. NOK is not the next GME. NOK is not the next TSLA. NOK is NOK. I gave a conservative PT of $10 EOY and I still stand by it, not what you gaylords translated to $10 EOW or some shit. Keep in mind, that‚Äôs still over a 100% gain, so tendies are there.

Looking at my previous DD, here‚Äôs how you should REALISTICALLY, and qualitatively, value $NOK:

&#x200B;

>5G infrastructure giants‚Ä¶ with little Chinese competition thanks to Daddy Trump (RIP) banning Huawei, Nokia is in an oligopoly when it comes to 5G infrastructure.

* It takes a long time to build infrastructure, infrastructure that won‚Äôt pay out until later

&#x200B;

>Which means‚Ä¶. they are the world‚Äôs 3rd largest telecoms equipment manufacturer

* 3rd largest, but still in a fiercely competitive landscape

&#x200B;

>Nokia does a lot of patent licensing, meaning steady cash flow

* Nothing to say on this point

&#x200B;

>Beyond telecommunications, they also work in imaging, sensing, Internet of Things, all the buzzwords

* These are all growing industries that show a lot of potential

&#x200B;

>Recently new management

* They will be doing some cost cutting and strategic positioning. Cost cutting is immediate but strategy takes a while to materialize.

&#x200B;

>Government contract are also a sticky biz, and this is the coolest of them all:  
>  
>\- Motherfuckers signed with NASA a $14M contract to install 4G on the moon. The company is going to the atmosphere, boys

* Let‚Äôs talk about gov‚Äôt contracts. NOK has a lot of them globally, they are usually paid out in installments They‚Äôre sticky business that provides consistency over the long term.

&#x200B;

To address other concerns that have come up since:

* ‚ÄútHe fLoAt iS tOo BiG tO pUmP‚Äù Yeah no shit dude. WSB has such little influence to actually pump anything, plus if you want to dump it, it becomes illegal.
* **GME and BB Gang**, we are not trying to divide you. We are seeing opportunity elsewhere. Shut the fuck up and I‚Äôm rooting for you.
* **NOK Gang**, also shut the fuck up. Stop spamming and shit, actually present good arguments as to why NOK.
* Other DDs have been great and have done supplement research/brought up other points. Props to them.
* I jacked off before posting this and it was red. Mental note to see a doctor later.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Still a BULL but  you retards need to ground your expectation, now everyone hates NOK because it didn‚Äôt throw up two days of 15% returns in a row like you shills said. Very bullish on NOK, but it is a LONG TERM play. I‚ÄôM NOT FUCKING SELLING. Suck my willy.

TLDR; Mass BB call option buying has forced the big boys to short this like crazy. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

I wanted to point out that whats happening this week in BlackBerry is actually quite amazing. Yesterday, you beautiful retards bought and opened tens of thousands of option contracts that expire this Friday at $25 in BB. There was also a mass buying of the $20 contracts. What we are seeing today and saw some yesterday is big boys are coming in and shorting this stock like crazy. These guys sold thousands of contracts to us for this Friday and they HAVE to keep the BB price under $25 or this is GME all over again.

This is actually the type of setup a large hedge fund might see and say hey if we can push BB over 25 by Friday it will cause so much frenetic buying that the stock might hit 40. 

Likely nothing will come of this, but if you are wondering why your favorite meme play is down today despite good news (BAIDU partnership) and LOTS of new money coming in on the buy side this is why.

I haven't talked to my WS people on the borrow situation. In my day, the best place to short stuff like this was actually the retail brokers, but NO hedge funds prime at these brokers and generally can't access these pools easily. A smart hedge fund has a little money at every broker he can, but it makes accounting and reconciliation a royal pain in the ass. Most hedge funds have 1-4 prime brokers. The very biggest have an account everywhere, but folks keep it centralized. Of course those prime brokers try to go around get 'borrow' for their clients, but typically they need to have someone custodial assets long (someone who owns gamestop) and then the rate is competitive. However, I'm pretty sure RH can give a locate/borrow to someone like Morgan Stanley (who incidentally bought eTrade). The borrow world is extremely opaque. IBKR sources borrows from lots of sources but they're a bit unique. It isn't uncommon from what I'm told for one desk to be paying a 50% fee to the client/lender and charging 75% to the borrower, capturing quite the spread. Back when I was short MNKD, the rate eclipsed 100%. Anyone know where it's at now?
  The next thing I'd say is the Melvin situation is unprecedented. SAC and Citadel have a lot of capital, but in the scheme of things, they're still hedge funds that aren't 10x or 100x bigger than Melvin. Well, there really aren't any hedge funds 10x bigger than Melvin, and the one that does exist (Bridgewater) doesn't get involved in individual stocks. The rest that are close are basically SAC, Citadel, etc, but they're only 2-5x bigger.
  The real question is, is Melvin out or not. My guess is they MUST have made the trade smaller given their losses. If I were Gabe I'd try to work the losses off, take a sort of ""one time charge"" (not really a thing in HFs) and move on. With discounted fees on new money he might survive, despite this being a big risk-management failure, it is quite the black/white swan. But I don't see Citadel/SAC investing knowing this trade is still on. That brings me to the next point.
  Yes, in the long run, I am bearish on GME. That means in 24 months the stock will almost certainly be lower than where it is today. That's what I do. I'm an investor. I've never been a great trader. That's probably because it's very hard to be a great trader. Even the best traders (think Cohen) are right around 55-60% of the time. You have to be nimble and accept losses quickly. Anything can happen here in the short run. Anything. The stock could go to 1,000. It'd be really stupid, but it could happen. I'm sure some of you are familiar with the ""max pain"" theory, that stocks tend to take the path that causes the most pain. That would be it.
  That doesn't mean I anything anyone should be buying GME. This is just the biggest poker game that ever has been played. It's really breathtaking. Longs know what their ultimate fate is, but it is sort of like Wily E Coyote. Whoever blinks first loses. In situations like this, I have found that BOTH sides typically lose. How? The shorts get blown up, obviously. After they get blown away, the greedy longs get blown up. The first-to-the-long guys are usually out pretty quickly (think 4 to 8, I'm done!) and the only ones who win. The first to the short guys typically stop out (idiots) or dig in (bigger idiots). If they dig in they almost never ride it out and get ""bought in"" or lose all their AUM through withdrawals or sometimes ""blow up"" (lose 100%+ of their capital). Blowing up means brokers take a loss, eg their prime broker. If I'm MS (Morgan Stanley) or someone like that, I'd be talking about my risk exposure to this trade lol. It reminds me of the old saying, ""lose $1 million, you have a big problem. lose $100 million, the bank has a big fucking problem."" At some point the chain of custody of the loss passes from LPs to the bank/brokerage. I'm sure some small hedge funds have already been wiped out.
  So, long story short (or short story long?), I still am firmly convinced GME is going nowhere from a fundamental standpoint. There will be no miracle Ryan turnaround that ever makes it worth $100+. But that doesn't mean the stock won't go up today, tomorrow, or even this whole quarter or half of the year or whole year. This is all a crazy Wall Street speculative frenzy and buying begets buying. I think there's a 30% chance it's all over and it goes down quite soon. A 30% chance it goes up, still quite a bit (30-50%) and blows off and then it's all over relatively soon. And then there's a 30% chance it doubles and then drops. And a 10% chance it could go up 10x before it is halted or there is some rule change or it eventually cracks.
  Whatever happens, you all made history. I'm kind of proud and kind of sick. Most importantly, I wish I was long! No position. Asked my people to look into shorting it over the weekend and told them today, yeaaah don't do that. I almost never trade as it's pretty difficult to invest from here and I think this one is probably too tricky to figure out without access to information (borrow movements, fund returns, etc.) If I had access to what all the borrow desks on the street are doing, friends at every fund who is a player in this debacle, returns from the funds themselves, one could kind of map out what is happening. Robin Hood level information would be the best, but clearly no one has that (except for Citadel lol). 
  Good luck to all, be careful (don't have more than half of your money in GME, don't use margin) and I hope you all make a fortune.

""Man,"" you think to yourself, ""Cohen City sure is beautiful this time of year."" Your blissful trance is interrupted by the whirring of your hover-Tesla landing itself by the pool. ""Good morning sir,"" chimes T3SS, the soft-spoken AI, ""your Neuralink has indicated your are in need of service."" You step into the back of the vehicle, taking a moment to run your hand across the soft, bear-leather interior. ""Take me to the nearest GameTower,"" you say with a smile, ""my girlfriend's husband has been a good boy lately, I thought I might pick him up a Switch 5 as a treat.""

Gliding through the remnants of Old Manhattan you can't help having a twisted sense of delight seeing the old hedge fund offices now in ruin. ""Serves them right,"" you sigh, shaking your head. As you descend to the ground entrance of MegaGameTower #8A, you hear an abrupt warning chime. ""Gay Bear detected at landing site,"" urges T3SS, ""Shall I commence eradication procedures?"" You look below to see the familiar sight of a desperate, tattered boomer on the sidewalk. Just before you can say yes, you notice a look in his eyes. You recognize this one, you've seen his face before. ""Actually T3SS, don't worry about procedures, drop me down next to him, I wanna talk.""

You step out of the vehicle and approach the man. You can tell he's clearly disturbed, rocking back and forth muttering ""tw-tw-TWenTY, tw- TWenTy"" to himself. He locks eyes with you, ""oh SIR, PLEASE sir, one short is all I need! can you PLEASE spare some credits for a poor analyst like me?"", he begs. ""Actually Andrew,"" you prod, his eyes widening from the shock oh hearing his name, "" I have a better idea. Let's take you inside, I'll buy you anything you want, I'll even throw in a year's worth of PowerUpPrime+ membership so we can't get you into an apartment, how's that sound?""He tears up, ""y-you mean you're not gonna hack me, or sign me up for Grindr?"" ""No,"" you assure him, ""I think you've had enough, I think it's time someone showed you that GameAzonCorp isn't the dying retailer you think it is."" ""b-but the NUMBERS?"" he stammers. You cut him off, ""Oh just look around you, you stupid lemon! They own this whole CITY, and the board is in talks of acquiring the Canadian Federation, do THOSE numbers add up?"" Andrew looks defeated, ""I-I guess you're right. I guess this whole time I was just hoping that one day, ONE day I'd be right about something. It's about time I start listening to market geniuses like you."" You smile, ""See, that wasn't so hard was it, come on buddy  let's go.""

Later that night, as you're tucking in your girlfriend's husband, he turns to you ""You really are the best cuckolder I could've ever asked for! Tell me again the story about how you defeated all the big mean boomers and became a trillionaire!"" You chuckle ""Haha, sure thing little buddy."" The story is a short one.

""The year was 2021. The retard army and I were holding the line as the evil bears were advancing, paper hands were dropping around us left and right, we weren't sure we could stay retarded much longer. But then, General DFV led us forward. We pulled together, diamond hands at full capacity, never selling, never using margin, until finally, FINALLY, the hedge funds relented. 'ENOUGH,' they cried, their clients' portfolios deep in the red, 'We surrender! Please, PLEASE let us buy your shares, we can't take it anymore!' And, well, the rest is history..."" you drift off seeing that he's asleep.

As you lay in bed you can't stop smiling thinking about that story. ""I've made it,"" you think to yourself, ""It was all worth it.""

# GameStop History Lesson:

**tldr**: GME bumbles about like a senile boomer and dabbles in terrible bets. Turns into undervalued stock with cultural significance, gets picked up by Big Dick Burry and Ryan Chewy Cohen.

GME is a childhood dream that turns any grown man into an autist as soon as he walks into the door. Now due to our Lady Rona (covid), a bunch of past Boomer business decisions ([GME fucking bough 507 AT&T stores](https://news.gamestop.com/node/10001) in 2014, not pivoting into omni-channel, [largely misssing the gaming industry explosion](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf), and [a CEO](https://news.gamestop.com/leaders/george-sherman) who prides himself on brick and morter Advance auto parts, Best Buy, Target, Home depot) GME by and large was shitting the bed as investors thought of this company as neglected mallfront with dwindling clientele.

&#x200B;

**In comes Michael big dick Burry**

With the stock trading at $3.78/share in August 2019 investers were sure it was finished. But here's where it gets interesting. With big dick energy seemingly out of no where Michael Burry *(yes that dude in the Big Short who seems like a fellow autist)* buys 2,750,000 shares or 3.05% of GameStock. In his actual [letter to the board](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190819005633/en/) *(yes I dug it up so you can read it as well)* he describes the thought process for the purchase bullets below.

* GameStop was trading at an all-time low ($3.78/share) and he believed that it had not leveraged it's ""elite potision in the gaming universe"" over the last 5 years *(keep in mind, it's fucking GameStop a cultural icon large enough to make a grown man weep with fond memories*
* Shareholders do not have faith in current managament and have not been inspired by new leadership policies
* At time of writing stocks were more than 60% shorted

&#x200B;

*(Taking a break to say, it's not too late the* ***squeeze has not been squoze*** *oblig üíéüôå = üöÄüöÄ)*

&#x200B;

**Ryan mega dick Cohen writes a letter**

Then in Nov 16th 2020, Ryan Cohen comes in swinging and tears a new one to the board members of GameStop. For people who don't know who Ryan Cohen is, he stuck the finger to Amazon and [built a digital e-commerce site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewy_(company)) (wiki link) for fucking dogs and cats into a $3.35 billion entity by 2017. Keep in mind that he submitted a Schedule 13D to purchase 121,644 shares at $6.56 per and 163,030 at $8.63 - that's a 10% stake [(yes, I've also dug the original Schedule 13d using google)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000699/rc13da2-091820.htm). Now Ryan's letter reads like a solid talking down that might rival the Queen - looking at you [r/TheCrownNetflix](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrownNetflix/), [r/AskUK](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/).

[I've included Ryan's letter to the board](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf) but will bullet point paraphrase below for you folks still on Yahoo or Ask Jeeves.

* GME has a strong brand across the globe and has 55 million PowerUp members
* GME needs to pivot immediately to a tech structure and it can *(lolz, after this letter they immediately brought Ryan and Chewy co onto board)*
* Size of the global gaming market has grown more than **2.5x** since the last console cycle

&#x200B;

**Ryan mega dick Cohen and team join GameStop board**

In January 2021 [Ryan Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen), [Alan Attal](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/alan-attal), and [Jim Grube](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jim-grube) join GME's board. Now for those of you in the bread line or living at your wife's mothers house playing [r/DnD](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/) with her boyfriend, board changes are big news. These board members have the power to make multiple grown men cry, fire CEOs like it's nothing and change a companies strategy sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.

With Papa Cohen coming onboard and his squad of Chewy troopers, it's likely that we are going to soon see a pimped out GameStop that will make you name your first born ""GME"". Now I'll let you do your own digging and reading but here's just some of the GME DD on it's future potential [(link to DD on some of GME's possible pivots](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/), [One DD to rule them all](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/))

# The squeeze has NOT been squoze:

There is still time for you to convince your wife's girlfriend to lend you money to buy GME. The squeeze has not been squoze and likely wont until we see the type of eruption that accompanied [r/belledelphineXmas](https://www.reddit.com/r/belledelphineXmas/) leaks (yes that sub is NSFW).

Side note on the Squeeze, GME is still massively over shorted at estimates from 130-300% and counting. The important thing to know is that these greedy bastards took multiple short positions on a single stock (naked) and essentially bet that GME was going to go down.

[https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today) (249.67% Shorted)

&#x200B;

**But what happened on Thursday/Friday?**

Gamma squeeze. Short and simple. Now you can read some other DD about what a gamma squeeze so I wont dive into it too much.

It was not the squeeze. Market makers needed to rush to fill calls that were In The Money. This prompted these market makers to buy up stock in the off chance that they needed to actually sell them to degens who were actually betting that GME would blow it's sweet load at 60 and now at 150 lolz. This pared with the low stock volume on the market makes for high volitility on a per stock basis. Here's some [DD links talking about what a Gamma squeeze what we witnessed was that.](https://nope-its-lily.medium.com/gamestop-power-to-the-market-players-part-2-6ef00eff1d26)

&#x200B;

**Ok MallCop2020, but when will it Squeeze?** *(when it does squeeze it may squeeze multiple times)*

Thanks to fellow autist [u/tsukune\_surprise](https://www.reddit.com/u/tsukune_surprise/) *(and no, CNBC I don't even know this person - they could be a robot or even a fucking dog with a cybor implant IDK!)* BUT I love their DD for the MOASS [(Mother of All Short Squeeze)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4bnfr/moatadd_for_the_moass_there_will_be_more_than_one/). Short answer is that it could be this week, could be next but it's hard to say when the big banks are using dirty tricks like naked call ladders, actual bail outs lolz. (*Fresh DD from another internet stranger on* [*GME EndGame Part 3)*](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l528pz/gme_endgame_part_3_a_new_opponent_enters_the_ring/)

>EVERY SINGLE indicator shows massive upward momentum on GME.  
>  
>GME momentum is going to create a massive upward feedback loop. The combination of options gamma squeeze, available float, and short interest makes it impossible for shorters to escape.  
>

>  
>But buying call options decreases the float and the only tightens the squeeze. It‚Äôs like fighting against quicksand for the shorters.

>This GME squeeze is going to be historic because of the compounding effect of options and short interest.  
>  
>This could be bigger than the VW/Porsche infinity squeeze. But it‚Äôs completely different from VW ‚Äì so don‚Äôt draw too many comparisons.

&#x200B;

**Okay, I've asked my wife's girlfriend nicely and now have $1k...**

Buy fucking shares. No legit, support your random internet brethren *(who don't know each other)* and buy shares of GameStop. Every share you buy bleeds money from Citron and Melvin.

Here's an explanation from [u/robert1032010](https://www.reddit.com/u/robert1032010/) a Hedge Fund Manager on the current short position within GME: [(A hedge fund managers perspective on GME)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/)

>The short positions of this issue appears (although I can't be certain) to exceed 100% with all available shares already lent out from marginal accounts and probably a lot of naked shorting going on as well. Although I don't yet have the current data on todays short position, I can say for certain the stock remains very heavily shorter, perhaps more so now than at any previous time. Today, I called my broker asking about the availability of shares to short and the borrow costs. We have one of the larger accounts at our brokers firm and I was able to speak directly to the ""hard to borrow"" desk. No borrowable shares are available at any broker, anywhere, at this time, even for high borrow costs or even from other brokers. This extreme short against a small common float, made more extreme no-doubt by naked shorting, could end very poorly for those short this issue. As they are forced to close out their positions, the stock will continue to rise and continue to exacerbate the positive effects the rising price has on the above 4 issues.

&#x200B;

Lastly, this is not financial advice; do your own DD. I'm holding $20k at $100/share and yes, I still fucking believe that the tendieman will come and rain tendies.

For reasons not publicly available, Donny Foss acquired 3.5 million shares of GME on or about February 28, 2020.

Hey, it's your boy ~~Chimpu~~ Tsukune Surprise.

This past weekend I posted some DD on the squeezes.  Yes, fucking plural you illiterate retard.

Many of you messaged me and said you enjoyed it.  Although I'm not sure how many people could actually read it.  I think most of you liked the pretty colors and lines.

I updated my TA for today's market close.  The TA does not include the absolute face ripping toboggan ride on your mom's river of squirt.  So whatever is in the document- just add some Peter North ropes of extra Gentleman's Relish (TM) to the top.

[Here's the the new file here for your masturbatory needs.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UvgkRd3LT7msm1vkHGOqq9kx4FU_suAz/view?usp=sharing)  Just scroll to the bottom for the updated technicals.  I kept the background DD in the document for you shit fuckers that haven't read it yet.

I'm still recording the audio book version for those of you busy licking fucking windows.

Here's the summary of what has changed.  Tighten your helmets and bibs.

As you all well know, Michael Burry is a retarded genius with dead eyes who basically prints money. After daddy Burry gave us GameStop when he initiated a very large position in early 2020, he also gave us another brilliant undercover idea in Q3 2020: CVS. 

Take a look at Scion Asset Managements 13F disclosure showing daddy Burry degenerately buying CVS Call Options. The fact Burry is holding shit tons of calls in addition to shares indicates a high level of conviction to me. 

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761920019679/xslForm13F\_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml

Similarly to Gamestop, CVS is a shitty looking chain of seedy feeling stores, where you go in to pick up your Chlamydia medication and leave sad. It is however undervalued!!!

So what does Burry know? The general outlook for healthcare spending is positive and on an accelerating curve, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating US healthcare spending reached nearly $3.5T in 2017, a dollar increase of 4.6% from 2016 levels. CMS is projecting healthcare spending to continue to grow at an even faster pace over the next decade, drive by expanding insurance coverage, an aging population, and increasing prescription drug costs. Specifically, CMS is expecting an annual growth per year of 5.5% between 2017 and 2026, with HC spending projected to reach 19.7% of GDP in 2026. 

The CVS acquisition of Aetna closed in November 2018, with the goal of creating an integrated healthcare platform to better position CVS from competitive threats. The concept is unproven and will take time to develop. From a cost perspective, management sees cost savings totaling at least $750m by 2020, with $350m coming in 2019. 

Let‚Äôs look at the money. Most of you morons prefer companies that lose money yet have fancypants PowerPoint presentations, so please avert your eyes looking at a cashflow positive balance sheet:

  Percentage of revenues:

| | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Pharmacy | 76.7% | 76.4% | 75.0% |
| Front store and other | 23.3% | 23.6% | 25.0% |
|| 100% | 100% | 100% |

2019 Earnings:

&#x200B;

| In millions (except stores) |2019 |2018|2017|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Total revenues | 256,776 | 194,579 | 184,786 |
| Operating income | 11,987 | 4,021 | 9,538 |
| Income (loss) from Ops | 6,631 | (596) | 6,631 |
| Net income (loss) to CVS |  6,634 | (594) | 6,622 |
| Number of Stores | 9,941 | 9,967 | 9,846 |

  

CVS basically does $6 billion in net income a year, and has a market cap of $97 billion, so it trades a Price/Ebitda of about 15 and an Enterprise Value/Ebitda of about 10 -- which in this market is FUCKING CHEAP. CVS is massively accelerating its rollout of minute clinics, and will continue to absorb all the fallout from private doctors and hospitals closing in the wake of Covid19. 

This is a list of over 500 rural hospitals that are facing closure due to Covid. CVS will absorb a lot of the demand for primary care that hospitals meet ‚Äì remember most Americans are retarded and treat hospitals like primary care doctors.  
 [https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/state-by-state-breakdown-of-897-hospitals-at-risk-of-closing.html](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/state-by-state-breakdown-of-897-hospitals-at-risk-of-closing.html)

Additionally, the complete and total death of most retail stores, and the decimation of mom & pop stores, will only be a tailwind to CVS. This is sad but true. 

Lastly, the implied volatility on CVS options is CHEAP!! Basically, this is not a stock that generally makes sharp moves, nor does the market expect it to ‚Äì meaning that you can buy options very very cheap. And IF the market or WSB figures out that daddy Burry wants us to buy this too ‚Äì expect these options to EXPlODE!!!

I received a handful of PM requests, all from brand new users, and one shown below from an avatar with a female pic (and we all know no hot women are on WSB, just a bunch of fat teens in their parents' or wives' basements!).  In the past I have received a total of **zero** PMs when I've shared an opinion.

**Be warned.... The shorts are truly scared and perhaps they're trying to engage private convos to take to the SEC or other authorities but there is NO REASON to put yourself at risk when we're doing NOTHING WRONG!**

I'm entitled to buy/sell securities just like the shorts and market makers are and when I've been wrong they sure didn't show me any mercy.  Do what you want but this only confirms my thesis IMO!  More pics of the messages below.  If I'm wrong and these are legit so be it, all user names are hidden.  **But this is very fishy and you've all been warned.

Dont be fooled by the media narrative which is controlled by shorters such as Melvin, Citron & Co. The short squeeze has not even started yet.

We've all seen the memes, and the convincing rants, but here I present something different.

The horizontal blue lines with their price marked on the right, are going to be critical levels during the march upward. You can see that the $25-$40 are is going to be a helluva fight, but its a straight shot up to $70 from that point. Above $70, looks like room to high $80s-low$90s, then absolute chaos to the top with ATH at $148. There will be many unforeseen events along the way, and we can not plan for everything.  

The current levels that we are in need to be held until then. We just had a massive gap up the past couple days, so don't be discouraged if BB flails around, and seems stagnant for the next few days, it is natural. Just buy up every dip and we will be knocking on the $40-$70 area in no time.

HEAR THIS!: 

I am in no way trying to take away from the GME momo. I am in the thick of it with the rest of you tards, and will be until the very end. BB has been, and will continue to be a huge play for months to come, and we should all be excited about that. There is no need to have a competition right now, we need to stick together, seeing how the suits are trying to incite rifts within. Stay strong. The tendie Kingdom is vast, and we shall be there in step, together.

It was up roughly 50% to ~$225 in after hours.

In my opinion the short squeeze isn't over, but I think there will be an avalanche down tomorrow at open with multiple trading halts.  People will likely sell at 200+.  I expect it to rise again after the bloodbath.

I am not scared.  I took my theta gains and put my spacesuit on.  I'm going to the fucking moon.  I've got salvos of trailing buy stop orders ready to be strike at a moment's notice at the drops.

Be smart if drops happen.  Have a plan, lie in wait, and pounce.

If you have the insane risk tolerance for this, I think it's worth it.  If it dips I'm buying calls at several steps and holding one of those until this stock goes nuclear.

Good luck in this anarchy.

Here's the short of it:

\-  15 U.S.C. ¬ß 78 is the relevant US code that governs market  manipulation.  It's got a few rules.  Publicly traded companies have to  regularly make disclosures (so not WSB).   And it regulates exchanges,  dealers, brokers, insiders, and employees of publicly traded companies  (only you can decide if you're one of these.  Personally, this raised an  interesting question for me because I'm in venture capital (that,  thankfully, it looks like I'm OK on), but YMMV.  Maybe you work for a  meme company and have gone full retard.  You're on your own.

***Obviously, ""market manipulation"" is what everybody here is shaking their titties over.  The rules here are pretty simple.***

\-You  can't ""create false demand"" or overtly distort prices.  Remember, this  law was written in the 1930's, so being able to lie about something's  price was easier back then.  Not really applicable today.  Nobody here  is creating ""false"" demand.  In the case of short squeezes, it's  creating ""actual"" demand.

\-Can't  talk about insider information - yet to see that here, so all good.   Even if I did see it, I wouldn't trust half of you to properly interpret  what you read unless it was full of rocket ships or eggplants.

\-Can't  spread false information about a company.  While I would argue there's  actually a lot of that here, it's not with intent, it's out of ignorance  99 out of 100 times.  Further, the SEC hasn't effectively enforced this  rule in decades.  There are hedge fund managers who openly admit to  breaking this law.   Plus, the original intent with this law was  (apparently, according to lawyer) meant more for companies to not pull  an Enron.  It is, in other words, in effect toothless.

\-The  interesting one is with regards to group trading.  So there's a whole  set of rules that comes into play when an organized group of traders own  more than 5% of a company's stock.  I'll spare all the boring middle  details here because the conclusion is nobody KNOWS how much of a  certain company's stock this sub collectively owns.  I would posit a  very strong theory that we own quite a bit more than 5% of Gamestop,  BUT....there's never been a straw poll to prove it and nobody here has  any real way of knowing if that's the case.  Even if somebody did, they  would have to effectively communicate it to everybody else in the sub to  alert them of potential conflicts/problems, because ""intent"" is a  qualifier for this particular rule.  There's no fucking way this island  of misfit toys is going to be effectively communicated that status.   Even if that information did become widely known, it would be impossible  to prove that rocket emojis, calling people paper handed bitches for  exiting a position, or telling people to let their wives' boyfriends  take care of the women while you're off earning your tendies qualifies  as illegal coordinated manipulation.  Especially given how many bots and  shills Melvin has deployed here lately trying to discourage or scare  people into selling their positions.

Which  means what everybody largely suspected, anyways:  All the people on TV  are blowing hot air to try and scare people at the behest of their hedge  fund manager bosses and to create a story that fits a pre-defined  narrative.  The SEC doesn't give two shits about you and isn't spying on  you (but that plumbing van that's been outside your house might be a  problem - your wife's boyfriend might have gotten a boyfriend), and you  can take off the tin foil.  Unless you're long REYN, in which case  you're probably helping your Boomer stock oh-so-slightly, Randy.

TL:DR:  Securities Fraud requires fraud, which requires intent, so

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ  = fine

üíéü§≤ = fine

üåàüêª  = not just fine but necessary

ü¶çü§≤üí™  = just good strong community bonding

At open GME ripped and LB/BABA/FISV (Melvin's holdings) took a complete shit because they started liquidating to pay for GME, then they got bailed out and bought their shares back.

Average volume of LB is 3m shares. Melvin sold 1M in an hour and tanked the share price 10% on Monday. Melvin owns 25M shares of LB, or 1/9th of the entire float.

LB closed 20% of their Victoria's Secret stores this year due to covid, and Amazon is literally killing them.

If you want a low premium play, buy LB puts for this GME squeeze.

**EDIT:** You want LB puts instead of their other holdings because LB is their holding with the highest percentage of float.

Honestly this felt like a demo webinar that also could've just been posted on their youtube channel for everyone to see.

The positive: it was great. I don't think I've learned anything new other than confirmations on how powerful their said features are and incredibly smooth their UX is.

The negative: their presentation obviously wasn't catered to stock market investors (felt more like a sales pitch). They didn't boast any new numbers or clients, which probably explains the after-hours price action. Also, their roadmap wasn't really demo'd. They just explained with words on what they plan on doing (again, if true, very cool but would've been compelling if they had clips supporting the roadmap as well).

My takeaway: just confirmation bias for long term holders that Palantir has great, premium products. Great insight on their tech but it was a hyped event that doesn't help the stock short term like tomorrow.

What are your thoughts?

So, these numbers are pretty indicative of the extremely bullish market sentiment regarding Nokia, which on its own is great for both the company and investors. But how could these options drive the price of NOK? 

Current total Call Options ($5, $7, $10) = 1,008,515 = 100,851,500 shares

&#x200B;

Now let's look at the top institutional holders of NOK as of 29 September 2020:

[From cnn.com](https://preview.redd.it/puthg1tuyqd61.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef33064e0d9f0b78593de2701929d20353f2bc2e)

In mid February, the new 13f filings will be released so that we can see up-to-date institutional holdings. What will that tell us? Basically, we'll be able to look at the big boys who are writing these option contracts to determine whether or not they have adequately covered. 

What happens if they didn't hedge their calls? As the price rises over $5, $7, and $10 we will see very high volume buys so that these institutions can manage their risk.

**Alternatively, we can look at the charts to see if this is already happening.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Unfortunately there is no data for what the OI for $4.50 calls were on 25 Jan 2021, so this is what we'll have to use.

|Type|Strike Price|Open Interest Total|Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Call|$4.50|43,879|4,387,900|
|Call|$5.00|459,590|45,959,000|

On 25 January, immediately before opening, the stock price hit $4.50 which triggered a massive buy from institutional holders who had written those call options.

[26 Jan 2021 Market Open](https://preview.redd.it/4k7lo0ia6rd61.png?width=278&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee061d431c2993b37e14f2ced3aad1a27a90b1d1)

On 26 January, immediately before market opening, the stock price his $5.00 which triggered a massive buy from institutional holders followed by what looks to be high volume short-selling from institutions to cover the \~100,000+ Put options that are in the market.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**What does this all mean?**

Price volatility/ramping is already happening. More people are buying both ITM and OTM calls, and the institutions who write them are already needing to buy shares in order to cover. This will continue to happen as NOK pushes beyond the $5 mark. 

It also means that nearly ALL Put options at $5 have been covered thus far, which means that we shouldn't expect to see the price get forced downward like this morning again.

If you are holding this stock long or short, don't be intimidated by the high volatility. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR**

Today was really high volatility around $5 as institutions covered their call/put options. They covered nearly every put option, which means **we shouldn't expect any significant downward volatility like today going forward until we reach the next big Put option strike prices.**"|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224312.csv|StockTicker

Wow - what a week. This is an extension of my DD series on GME. If you haven‚Äôt read them and have time, they will provide some background on my previous predictions, some of which have already come true. 

# Previous Important Posts

* [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) (DTC Infinity) covered the short positions, the float, and potential snowball impacts of increasing prices, and argued that part of the reason that shorts haven‚Äôt closed was that it was pretty much impossible for shorts to close 
* [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) covered Cohen, fair market cap analysis, and potential investors, in which I talked about the amazing mid-to-long term potential for GME. 
* After the Citron tweet, I shared this [fan fiction on what looked like blatant market manipulation by shorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) on the day of the tweet, and offered some education on strengthening your position. This one got buried and is worth reading. 

# What‚Äôs happened thus far

### Why did GME go up on Friday? 

The story here is more complex than paid media articles would like you to believe. GME has been driven up by 3 different forces: 

* Organic buying
   * There is a mixture of growing positive sentiment in the investor world (not just WSB) about GME‚Äôs future
   * There‚Äôs been a lot of good due diligence shared not just on WSB but even outside (for example, see gmedd.com)
   * The Citron Backfire
      * Shorts were on the ropes and kept looking for hail mary‚Äôs. They went to Citron and [coordinated a dump](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) to try to bring the price down.
      * However, this backfired. Citron is so disliked in the industry that new wealth poured into GME in the face of Andrew Left‚Äôs pleas. Even when Benzinga brought Andrew Left on air, **minutes after he left** [they bought shares live on their show](https://youtu.be/mFiFWBrE5DE?t=5104)**.** 
      * The next day, our very on u/Uberkikz11 [was on Benzinga](https://youtu.be/GLzTU87MJMM?t=837) and more shares were bought. 
   * Larger investors piling in
      * In my [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/), I hypothesized that we‚Äôd soon see larger investors pile in. Then, on WSB, we saw posts from a [venture capitalist](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/) as well as a [hedge fund investor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/)
* Gamma squeeze
   * Once the organic buying started, we rolled into a gamma squeeze. Many people written about the gamma squeeze so I won‚Äôt repeat, see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/) for an example. 
* Ultra low liquidity - In EndGame part 1, I talked about how the actual actively traded shares are much lower than the reported float, and **share availability has been reducing** driven by lots of diamond hands, not just among smaller guys like us but the larger folks too. 
* I believe there were some short covers on Friday, but Ortex was still estimating 71M shares short at the eod. 

However, not many people have talked about why it **went down**

### Why did GME come down? 

Here‚Äôs where things got interesting for me, and something I think happened again today (Monday) when GME climbed up over 100% but then had a rapid reversal, closing 20% above yesterday but closing below open. 

So Friday looked like a slam dunk - gamma squeeze, no shorts available to short, puts were getting exceedingly expensive as a short tactic. What happened?

This is my fan fiction, based on what I saw.

**I believe** [**market-makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) **took a non-neutral stance and began actively shorting the stock after the second halt.** 

Market-makers are responsible for maintaining liquidity and functioning in the stock market, but they also have abilities that others don‚Äôt - for example they are legally allowed to naked short for ‚Äúliquidity purposes‚Äù. They also have the ability to halt trading. 

There were two halts in the day on Friday: First, when GME was up 69% (heh heh), and then a few minutes later when it kept climbing after the first halt was relaxed. Note that at the time of the first halt, the **bid-ask spread was $10 on the underlying** a huge signal that there just were not enough shares to buy.

However, after the second halt, something strange happened. Whereas a few minutes prior, there were no sellers willing to sell their shares below $75, **within 15 minutes** after the halt there were sellers at 70, 65, 60, and 56. Where did these sellers come from? 

&#x200B;

[Incredible momentum reversal on Friday 1\/22 to push the price not too far above the 60c strike price. ](https://preview.redd.it/tt5zodp6pkd61.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa22980543213227bf5b3d17166129ac6cb65a65)

My speculation? This was a coordinated **naked short ladder attack**. In this type of attack, short seller A sells to short seller B, who then turns around to short seller A at a lower price, etc. and with a **very small amount of capital** you can wreck the momentum of a stock and make people think that others are running for the exits.

Notice how the stock dropped from a high of $75 on Friday to below 60 - the highest expiring SP for the 1/22 options, and stayed tight in range for the rest of the day. Now, for compliance reasons, MM are required to be neutral by EOD, so 20 minutes before close, MMs had to buy back all their short positions, which led to the strong close above 60.

All this led me to believe that the **real fair market price for GME was above $65.** Without the market makers interference, GME would have closed higher. 

### A repeat on Monday

The short ladder attack repeated on Monday. 

GME opened strong above $90, and quickly climbed to **a high above $155** before it was halted, immediately after the halt, a **short ladder attack again** drove the price down 

&#x200B;

[Dejavu - Incredible Momentum Reversal after trading halts. ](https://preview.redd.it/qm81rd0dpkd61.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b4563e7dd2e626fb09dca69668c24631932e707)

Both days, there **were rapid and significant reversals in momentum.** 

Now, I kept wondering - why would MM‚Äôs take the side of the shorts? What‚Äôs in it for them? One theory was that they were not adequately hedged, with the low liquidity of the stock meaning that the price was moving up too fast for them to acquire the shares they needed to. 

But then the news hit today: 

# A new opponent enters the ring:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8htb0scgpkd61.png?width=926&format=png&auto=webp&s=228a8a84e592ea4642a61c5e07e07ae344ac8f2c

That‚Äôs right, the **same Citadel** [**listed by the NYSE as one of their designated market makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) is now invested in Melvin‚Äôs hedge fund and has a financial interest in the direction of GME‚Äôs share price. 

**Hey media - you want a manipulation story? You‚Äôre missing the big one.** 

# Now what? 

Shorts have pulled new dirty tactics each time they‚Äôve been pushed to the edge. Paid media attacks, Citron‚Äôs fluff tweet + coordinated shorting, and now they‚Äôve got the **actual people who get all the order flow on their side.** 

On the other hand, GME is still up over 20% and now trading at $88.00 after hours, which is well above the previous day‚Äôs high. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rr5qet4ipkd61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=96d28bf446a714906712503726f5903a681d5368

What this tells me is that GME‚Äôs **true price is still being suppressed**. They are using every tactic possible, even changing the [bid-ask spread rules](https://thefly.com/permalinks/entry.php/id3233043/GME;IRBT-NYSE-changes-bidask-differentials-on-options-for-GameStop-iRobot) on options to specifically target retail‚Äôs buying of options. 

We‚Äôre now playing the game against the folks who write the rules of the game. 

Some shorts may have covered today - with prices below $60 at one point they had some great opportunities to. However, there is **no way all of the shorts who need to exit covered today.** 

The short position still lost 20% from yesterday. They‚Äôve got more fingers in the dam, but it‚Äôs definitely cracking. Also, **every call option purchased prior to 1/25 is ITM and profitable,** while **every put option purchased prior to 1/25 is OTM.**

And, for some reason, the SEC still doesn‚Äôt want to enforce the threshold securities list for GME, where it‚Äôs now **been on for more than 30 days in a highly covered ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù.**

&#x200B;

# Margin impacts:

Note that at this point, most brokers have increased margin on GME. This means that people that are long or short on margin will need to put up capital to hold their positions. 

This also means **puts will get more expensive** as people who sell puts will have to maintain 100% of the notional in their accounts to secure the put, so MMs will have fewer retail sellers of puts to absorb the demand. 

That means it‚Äôs not a bad idea to sell puts to acquire shares if you‚Äôre aiming for the long-term and not the squeeze, but keep in mind you‚Äôll need the exact same capital as if you‚Äôd bought the shares, so it‚Äôs up to you on this. 

For shorts, a margin increase while the price is moving against you (even with retracements) is no good. 

# My speculation

* Cohen and the GME board have been strangely silent this entire run. It‚Äôs possible they can‚Äôt say anything at all during the pre-earnings quiet period, but I‚Äôm sure they can see what‚Äôs happening. 
* MMs will continue to play dirty, but at the same time they will need to continue to need to buy GME shares to delta hedge 1/29 and later ITM options as we get closer to expiry. 

# Things to be careful about

As you can see, this is no easy win. I've been in GME for a few months but I've seen almost every trick in the book. In addition to the [suggestions I wrote about in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/), here‚Äôs some things to be careful about. 

* **Be careful about swapping ITM calls for OTM calls:** it can be tempting to trade-up your options for higher return, but be mindful of the delta impact. You may actually be driving the sale of shares by MMs when you don‚Äôt mean to. For example, if you sell a .5 delta call for 2 .2 delta calls, that‚Äôs net reduction of 10 shares that MMs have to hold long as leverage. 
* **Be careful about being short any calls this week:** Not only do you limit your upside (which is dumb in the prospect of a squeeze), you could end up in a nightmare scenario. A call that ends OTM on Friday could end up ITM after hours if you didn‚Äôt sell it, and you may get assigned while the underlying continues to go up. 
* **There are a few other dirty tactics shorts can play.** I‚Äôm not specifically going to share them here because I don‚Äôt want to give the ideas circulation, but 
   * **Choose your own limit sells based on personal sell points.** Don‚Äôt copy others and don‚Äôt try to be memey. Make your own decisions. 
   * **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it‚Äôs an **attack vector** for you. 
* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn‚Äôt resume for the rest of the day? **All your 1/29 calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you‚Äôre taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration. 
* **Be careful about buying on margin.** Brokers are rapidly increasing margins. If you bought on margin with 2:1 leverage, and the stock went up 100%, you‚Äôd be in margin call even without a margin change. If the broker moves margin against you, you‚Äôll get to margin call faster. 
* **Don‚Äôt bet more than you can afford to lose.** I‚Äôve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing (remember last Monday with the short sale restriction?), you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I‚Äôve held through multiple 30-40% drawdowns in the underlying; and **held through a 50% drawdown today**, so you need to be ready for the volatility. 
* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It‚Äôs common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you‚Äôve set a stop loss, be really sure about it.

Fingers crossed the mods have moved MVIS posts out from the under 1 billion-ish rule.....

Gather round fellow autists, come one, come all. I've got quite the story to tell you all. Now, this isn't my story, but the story of a little company called Microvision (MVIS).

**A LOT of this DD has been done by people that are way smarter than I over at** [r/MVIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/)\*\*. Those saints have an unreal DD that I will link\*\* [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/geaykw/dd_for_new_investors_crash_course_in_mvis/) **and a 'Best of MVIS' thread** [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/hrihan/the_best_of_rmvis_meta_thread/)**. Most of us here don't know how to read so I will take that DD and make this as simple as possible. Here are some facts...**

&#x200B;

# FACT - Microvision is best in class (LiDAR, MEMS, etc.)

This is another FACT. Microvision's LiDAR is the **BEST IN CLASS. See the image below for a comparison between the competition. This ALONE MEANS THEY ARE MASSIVELY UNDERVALUED.**

&#x200B;

[Clearly, they are BEST IN CLASS](https://preview.redd.it/14zt6mmxgpd61.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=c60f7170a195aafced5a0f60255a2dfc832e5b85)

From the chart above, clearly, they have the best LiDAR! **NOT ONLY ARE THE SPECS BETTER BUT THEIR A-SAMPLE IS GOING TO BE SHOWN OFF AROUND APRIL.** More than that, **THEY WILL BE READY FOR PRODUCTION GOING INTO THE FALL OF THIS YEAR!!** Which also makes them **FIRST TO MARKET** with a product like their LiDAR.

**TL:DR - MVIS IS BEST IN CLASS LIDAR** üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

&#x200B;

# FACT - Microvisions MEMS display hardware is used by Microsoft in the Hololens 2 and [IVAS](https://old.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/k9ge4v/defense_bill_clears_house_with_vetoproof_majority/) ([BAD.ASS.](https://old.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/k45io6/ivas_photo_80deg_horz_fov_waveguides_in_action/))

This isn't opinion, it is a simple fact. Those at Microvision and Microsoft will not actually acknowledge this fact, rumor is because they've been under an NDA for the last year or so. Every time either company is asked, they seem to deflect and name every other company like MVIS but not actually MVIS. WELL, [u/s2upid](https://www.reddit.com/u/s2upid/) over from [r/MVIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/) decided to take matters into his own hands. This many dropped $3,000 last spring just so he could DESTROY the device and find those pesky MVIS chips inside. [Looks like he found what he was looking for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/gm1i2f/hololens_2_teardown_the_hunt_for_mvis/) This begs the question, why is this partnership so secretive? Well, the major rumor floating around right now is a **buyout from Microsoft.** Them being so secretive makes sense as MVIS has the best in class MEMS (and LiDAR), and it would make sense they don't want to get into a bidding war.

PS. Microsoft also has a US government contract to supply the military with modified Hololens 2s called IVIS which are purposely modified and geared toward military use and operations.

**US Gov contracts = $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$**

**TL:DR - POTENTIAL MSFT BUYOUT**üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

&#x200B;

# FACT - Microvisions isn't only LiDAR and MEMS

The fact here is that MVIS has **FIVE** potential verticals they can sell!

* Display only devices
* Interactive devices
* NED devices
* Consumer LiDAR
* Auto LiDAR

I'm not sure how many of you can even read this many words in a year. Who the hell knows the potential of these verticals. Or what hardware is in each one. Or the cross-vertical applications of the hardware. My brain is short-circuiting even trying to think of words to think about this thought.

**TL:DR -** üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

&#x200B;

# Okay, this is getting long so let me wrap up with the most important point...

# MVIS Competition

So far the two main competitors for Microvisions LiDAR are looking like **Luminar (LAZR)** and **Velodyne (VLDR). Let's look at some simple numbers.**

**Luminar (LAZR)**

* **Stock Price - $37.45**
* **Market Cap - 12.13B**
* **Float - 177.19M**
* **Shares outstanding - 218.82M**

**Velodyne (VLDR)**

* **Stock Price - $23.53**
* **Market Cap - 3.97B**
* **Float - 55.52M**
* **Shares Outstanding - 168.71M**

**Wow!** Look at those market caps! Now let's see how Microvision compares...

**Microvision (MVIS)**

* **Stock Price - $7.25**
* **Market Cap - 1.097B**
* **Float - 145.69M**
* **Shares outstanding - 151.31M**

# WAIT A SECOND! I THOUGHT YOU SAID MICROVISION WAS BEST IN CLASS?!!?!?!?!?!?!??! WHY DO THEY HAVE NO MARKET CAP?!?!?!?!?

Well fellow autists, this is where the undervaluation comes into play. **LAZR**, who just started talking about LiDAR and aren't anywhere close to where **MVIS** is, is valued at **12x the valuation of MVIS**. **Yet, MVIS has the best in class LiDAR, first to market, and FOUR OTHER VERTICALS BESIDES LiDAR. Same with VLDR, trading at 4x MVIS with only the LiDAR vertical.**

**This is where the play becomes really juicy.** Let's play with some valuation numbers. If Microvision is even **CLOSE** to delivering on their LiDAR promises, shouldn't they be valued at **AT LEAST VLDR?** Well, let's play and see how that works out...

**Let's work with $7 as each billion in valuation for MVIS,** VLDR is 4B which is 4x MVIS. **So $7 per billion \* 4 = $28 stock price**. Keep in mind, this isn't even them being best in class, this is just average for **ONE VERTICAL.**

**So let's work it with a LAZR valuation, which is 12x MVIS currently. So $7 per billion \* 12 = $84 stock price! AND THAT IS STILL ONLY ONE VERTICAL!**

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

I wonder how many of you even made it this far. Probably no one so just remember **MVIS actual valuation should be 4-12x what it currently is! So many tendies.** I'll link in a few more DDs if anyone is interested in reading a bit more in-depth. I highly recommend going to check out [r/MVIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/) as I would be nowhere without their genius. 100% best DD on Reddit outside WSB.

**Good luck to all longs! I will see you in the Andromada Galaxy!**

I'm just a dumbass with some life experience to share.

**First, buy some goddamn personal umbrella insurance.** It's cheap af, like I pay $400 a year for mine. And it's easy af to buy. What is umbrella insurance? It's something poor people will never have to worry about, so be glad it's in your life now. **It protects you from lawsuits by parasites by adding million(s) of dollars in personal liability coverage above and beyond the policy limits of your auto, renters or homeowners insurance.**

Your shitty auto/renter/homeowners policies have limits of a couple hundred thousand bucks max. If you hit somebody's car, if someone slips and falls in your house, if someone accuses you of sexual assault, odds are there they will want to sue you. Any plaintiff's attorney worth half a fuck that they hire is going to do their research on you and when they do their DD and find out you have tons of assets now, they are going to come after way more than what they wanted thinking you were just some broke nobody. Umbrella insurance protects you from the unlikely but ever present threat of bankruptcy through lawsuits now that you are rich target. I've seen way too many idiot doctors and successful small business owners lose their life's work through negligence lawsuits and not having umbrella policies in place that would have stopped it.

Which brings me to my second request of you. Don't make yourself an obvious target. **Keep your goddamn mouth shut about your tendies and tell no one the particulars. Don't even fucking hint at it.** Don't tell dad to make him proud, don't tell strangers to impress them and feel good, don't tell some girl to get her to fuck you. I don't care if you shower the people you love with gifts, it's none of my business. If they ask, just say you had a good year trading and leave it at that.

Neither of my parents know about my trading profits, nor that I'm a millionaire. None of my friends know. I'll go to my grave not telling a soul. Because I see how people treat the people I know IRL who do flaunt it and I'm disgusted how some people (not all) no longer view you as a person, just something to exploit. 

**Why tf should you listen to me? Maybe you shouldn't. I was wrong af about GME.** I posted how I thought it was trash from $10 to $30 and while I thought u/DeepFuckingValue deserved props for eating shit all year and holding strong, I thought the rest of you were FOMO sheep chasing it in the $20s. Mea culpa. I'm glad I was wrong. I've never seen so many rattled old white men before in my life before this week and it's great. I'm genuinely happy for you guys that hit it big and hope the squeeze isn't over. Please consider what I've said.

I have been watching GME with almost every waking hour I have. It is safe to say that I was initially excited, but then worried about Melvin's bailout by Citadel and Point 27. Citadel are absolutely vast, and basically *are* the market, and have deeper pockets than anyone in the game thus far. I feared the squeeze may have been squashed. 



But then, **rejoice**



The eyes of the world are upon GME. This morning, my father who works for some boomer pension fund called me to excitedly tell me that GME was brought up in a meeting he had this morning. This is a fund in the *UK*, who has no real interest in GME. There has also been a Financial times of London article published this morning.

I have also seen a post this morning showing that GME is the most traded stock on *German* stock trading apps, and is making headlines.

There's even a *Chinese* article on this (https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3618399)

What does this mean? The boomer tricks they may have been trying will be seen by **everyone** in the world. The cheats and ploys will be noticed and called out *internationally*, and the SEC can surely not let its markets be seen to be manipulated. They surely don't want to lose face? It's a bad look beating down the little man. 



There is more to retail investors than purchasing power. We have the hopes and dreams of millions, being traded so some boomer fatcat can buy a second yacht. We have **jobs** being lost as their insidious tricks drive businesses under for a quick buck. And now we have people rooting for us too.



Pair this with solid fundamentals, the pivot to e-commerce, and still the potential for Ryan Cohen to tweet *literally anything*, and I'm just thinking there is one hell of a squeeze left in this tank. 




Get out now Melvin and Co., as it's now more than your money on the line.

The early morning action was unremarkable considering events of the last week. Ground was taken and lost between Cohen's Cohorts in the 80th and the battle hardened 95th. This is ground that has been fought over time and again, and I hope to never see it again for the remainder of my days.

**9:30 AM - 12:30 PM**

I fear I have asked too much of my men. They have already proved their worth to me a thousand times over and then a thousand again, but still I ask them to push. Ground continues to be taken and lost in an endless circle over the same bloody ground. Privately, I despair for the men of the 159th Weaponized Autists that were left stranded and wanting for reinforcements in yesterday's fighting. Every ounce of my strength is now focused on their safe return. Privately, I despair.

**12:30 PM - 1:00 PM**

Operation FD has been launched. The men of the 100th in conjunction with elite troops from the 101st Asperger's Airborne have launched a coordinated blitz assault. Pray for us.

**1:00 PM - 2:30 PM**

The enemy has been taken completely unawares. We're seeing men feared lost from the 110th and 120th trickle back to camp. Decisive gains have been made across the line. Each time we visit, enemy resolve weakens. I was a fool to have despaired. I know the men and women I fight with. The men of the 150th are fighting for their lives, but mark my words, we are coming.

**2:30 PM - 4:00 PM**

It is my pleasure to report that all stranded troops of the 120th, 130th and 140th have been joined, and despite their weariness continue to fight with a zeal that even the finest scribes known to man could not capture in words. As our troops massed alongside the 150th, General Left and his horde of crayons were seen retreating to ground that has not yet been contested. Fresh troops from the 200th have been brought up alongside elite ground units from Seal Team 160.

Tomorrow we ride to uncharted territory.

&#x200B;

edit: In a crushing blow to the enemy, Seal Team 160 obliterated all resistance in it's path. Troops are being rushed in from the 200th, 210th and 220th. Even reserve troops from the 230th saw brief action. The day is ours."|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224314.csv|StockTicker

# Fellow tards and mod-tards. This is the most boring post you will never read.

We are now entering a potentially dangerous phase for WSB. I won't repeat or cover all the various reasons why people are looking at this sub, nor what they are saying. 

The goal must be to ensure we don't tank this sub, and tank our tendies.

Its pretty simple: people who are used to making the rules and making money of the ignorance of others are on the wrong side of the trade, and they don't like it, and they won't take it laying down. 

üë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄüë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄ

They have extremely deep pockets and can throw insane amounts of money lobbying, getting talking heads on tv or lawyering up, if they haven't already. The narrative is pretty clear: WSB is acting like a mob; they are distorting the market; this isn't allowed. 

We are playing into their hands somewhat. We are helping fuel their arguments. If you don't want to lose this sub, here's what you can do

üåïüåùüåîüåìüåõüåíüåóüåòüåëüåñüåô

**1. Don't do dumb shit that will allow people to make legitimate complaints. Simple examples:** 

a. Doxxing or harrassing people e.g. Citron or Melvin Capital.

b. Trying to get people to buy particular shares of one stock in a concerted effort e.g. ""Lets all buy 10-100 shares of GME at 1000 EST.""

c. Publicly representing that we are in any way an organised, singular entity. 

**2. Don't give Reddit a reason to shut this down.** 

a. Chances of the SEC investigating WSB based on complaints are reasonably high; actually taking action though, the chance is v small in my view. For one, it would be hard to show intent and prove who was doing what to the price. Regulators only like to take on slam dunk cases - they dont have enough resources or political capital to waste on potentially losing hands. The exception is if there is a big public interest in doing so...this is another reason to observe point 1 above. This is not to say they won't give Reddit a call to say ""we think you need to sort out A,B,C‚Äù but this is v different from an enforcement action.

b. **Focusing on what the SEC might do misses the point. The threshold for a company disowning a small part of itself, to protect the whole, is very small. Reddit has 330M users. WSB has 2M. You do the math.**

Never mind trying to work out how much revenue Reddit makes from people who produce our quality of meme.

c. Any company who is aware that part of its users are breaking the law, or potentially breaking the law, will not hesitate to cut off the gangrene thumb. No one is going to go in for bat for us for some ideals or whatever. They are worried about bringing attention to the company as a whole, getting regulated, or civil or criminal exposure - as they should be - this is just normal and good governance. 

üíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíé

**3. Follow the rules for the sub. There are four elements here.**

a. Mods needs to tighten the rules to make it clear which conduct is not acceptable. I recommend including a small banner on each thread that states something like ""WSB does not tolerate any market manipulation or other breaches of law and those who do so will be instantly permabanned."" This can be hyperlink link to the rules or even SEC website.

b. But then - and this is important - the rules **must** be enforced. Whenever you have a compliance program in place, a regulator wants to see the compliance program was reasonable to achieve its required outcome e.g. Not breaking the law and that **it was enforced in fact**. If you have rules that are not enforced its almost worse than having no rules.

c. For us users, **don't break the rules**. Simples. 

d. And if you see other users breaking the rules, report it. Sounds like some Gestapo shit but at the end of the day, you either like this sub and want to protect it or you are going to miss the Tendieman. We have to collectively weed out shittiness and the mods are not going to be able to do this on their own - they are simply to retarded ;-) 

**4. Think about a serious plan B platform if this does get shut down.** 

Can't be Reddit - if the powers that be decide we are done, just calling it saulbeatwets or mallmeatnets won't fool them for long.

**5. Think about putting some tendie money aside to kick in for the mother of all lawsuits.** 

If this does go south, we should consider kickstarting a fund to hire the same type of white shoe law firms these dudes hire and get our guys to point out every known act of manipulation and let the SEC decide who the real problem is. This is how you really fight back and win. 

**6. While I have your attention - can we please try not to take out fellow retards here.** 

Its a big bad world and I can watch my own six and yep everyone needs to learn the hard way. But I don't think we should be out here bitching about Melvin etc while we are trying to shaft each other. If you see this shit, call it out and we'll gather our pitchforks. 

In return, **newbies please f$#@ing read some shit on here before you ask the same question ad nauseum** (the answer is the same anyway: ""No, its defo not too late to FOMO everything you or your tribe owns into an extremely volatile YOLO play and there is no way this can go tits up.‚Äù

 üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

**TL:DR: They are coming for this sub. Don't make it easy for them; follow the rules and mods enforce them.** 

Positions: GME to Melvin's uranus

Position:194 shares at $19.28


Disclaimer: I started trading this January and my views are purely informational and I do not condone anyone making financial/trading decisions based on this post. Don‚Äôt be a retard and do your DD before you trade. This is a bullish take on BB and may have some holes in it.



So I have been watching BB for a while now and feel the company is undervalued. Forgive me as I have not made a DD post before, I failed English in high school, and I am typing this up on my phone.


BB originally caught my attention because it struck me that it survived being primarily a phone company and shifted its business to its cyber security and other software. I Put it on my watch list to swing it a little bit and recently sold 140 shares at $11.


Seeing the price go up and the volume I decided I would jump back in since the trend analysis looked pretty good. Bought in at 19.28 and it almost immediately crashed, I suspect likely due to the pullback the whole market had this morning with stimulus talks being delayed and people taking profits.


Canada Halts trading today due to the volatility followed by BB making a statement in response basically saying idk why investors are buying up the stock we haven‚Äôt made any announcements 
Trading resumes and the price rises back up beyond open in AH, closing at nearly 20 dollars.

THEN as you have already probably seen, BB announces partnership with Baidu - coincidence? Probably not, investors probably coaxed that information out of them and they likely didn‚Äôt want to get caught in some insider trading schenangians. 

Speculation for tomorrow: BB Will open strong and meet or exceed the 40% growth of today since it just got that huge news. Baidu is Chinese google, and they partnered with BB since they need a operating system platform to mass produce their maps software in autonomous/ev vehicles with their partner GAC. Now this is a lot of China talk but BB is headquartered in CANADA which is much friendlier in regards to trade than the U.S.


A little bit of information about GAC, they are a Chinese automotive giant that has came to the United States National Automobile Dealers association expos begging for investors, however has not had much success since the last 4 years have not been good for U.S. and China Trade.


The LONG game: Once our new administration warms up to China after those in charge of trade take their cuts, (and they will because history repeats itself, but right now the bear case would be that Biden is not looking to change tariffs on China, playing tough until he gets some leverage is what I think is really going on) GAC will have lots of opportunity to start putting their vehicles on our roads. 
GAC is the highest rated car brand in China so it may have a chance in the United States if it plays its cards right, which means we could have Blackberry powered Autonomous EVs on our streets in the next 5 years. That in conjunction with Amazon partnership in their future autonomous ev ventures means this company is making a major comeback and is aligned with the right companies to potentially be a major player.

This company has a lot of value in our up and coming future of Electric and Autonomous vehicles.

I am too new to this to speculate on where this stock should be valued at, but here are some resources where I got my information so you can decide for yourself:

Edit2: Looks like I was a little overzealous for today‚Äôs speculation  overlooking the fact that other people want this thing to tank back down to buy in with less risk, RBC downgraded their rating today and there have been millions of dollars worth of buy orders in the sub 18$ range. I did make a point to mention this is a long play not just some pump and dump penny stock. üíéüôå on my shares at $19.28 - rookie mistake overlooking big boys interest in this rocket ship.

I‚Äôm an avid lurker on WSB and have been keenly following the GME saga. Although I haven‚Äôt actually gone around to putting any skin in the game myself due to my employment trading restrictions, I had a thought if it‚Äôs not already being actively employed, which it may very well be. 

GME is up 600%+ YTD and yet the short interest still remains 138%+ of float. The short squeeze that everyone is fighting for hasn‚Äôt actually happened or even started yet. The shorts who have gotten squeezed out have been quickly replaced by even more new shorts. There have been articles stating the short interest is even higher today than it was last week. So my question becomes, where the fuck are the shorts getting so much borrow from? Who is lending them all these shares? Now, anyone who uses a margin account basically agrees to have their broker lend your shares on their behalf anytime. You have to explicitly stop your broker from lending out your shares. I‚Äôm sure most of you know this, but I just wanted to flag so people can be actively aware that they can stop their shares from being lent out to shorts which may help bring on the squeeze. Who knows what percentage of float the WSB community is lending to these shorts but it must be meaningful I‚Äôm sure. Hell if Cohen with his 12.9% stake pulled any borrow I‚Äôm sure he could singlehandedly catalyze the real squeeze. 

EDIT: as per comments below, having GTC sell limit orders apparently does NOT stop your broker from lending out your shares. You‚Äôll have to contact the broker and probably have to have an all cash account (?). Most of you guys aren‚Äôt using margin for GME anyways so hopefully there‚Äôs a real way for the majority here to stop their shares from being lent out. https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-putting-a-high-limit-sell-order-will-prevent-shorts-from-borrowing-your-shares

Everyone should be calling their brokers to find out how and if they can stop their shares from being lent out. At this point, it‚Äôs worth the time putting in the call. 

I‚Äôm just a guy who wants to see the squeeze actually happen and see what price GME can reach when the squeeze is done. As of right now it seems like both sides are going strong and the shorts aren‚Äôt backing down so you need all the tricks up your sleeve you can get.

Last week I had 10k to my name. Come Friday I lost another grand bringing my portfolio down to 9k in total. I had a full week of bleeding value from 26k due to holding tesla calls hoping that there'd be an earnings run-up. Then on Friday I decided I had had enough. I knew Gamestop was doing well and it was sitting around 35 dollars so I figured why not? I threw 7 thousand dollars at it between calls dating for 1/22-1/29 with the highest one being about a $60 strike. Then came 10am Friday morning 1/22.

Gamestop shot up an astronomical amount breaching over 100% at one point. This sent my account flying. First 20k, then 30, then 40 and 50. It finally settled around 36k for the day for a whopping 29 thousand dollar gain for the day. I couldn't believe it!

Come Monday (yesterday) I bought even more shares and even more calls. I bought expirations of 1/29-2/5 calls with strikes ranging from 75-130. This drove my account up even further. I opened Monday at 63k, from there it quickly rushes and topped around 170k for a huge 300% 110k gain for the day. I didn't sell though. Then came the halts. The stock quickly fell all the way from 155 down to 60/share. I had gone from 170k to 12k in an instant. But I wasn't discouraged. When the halt ended I was stressed but I wasn't going to be discouraged. I bought only a couple more shares and held through the volatility. My account closed yesterday at 58k - I was down from the morning open but up on the day.

Now we are at the present. My account climbed from from 58k from yesterdays close to 72k at open this morning. I knew what kind of day I was in for from yesterdays events but this time I was ready. I would not paper hand and I would not miss the rocket! I clutched onto my calls and I held on tight to my shares. My account closed today at a new high of 143 thousand dollars. I sold my calls dated for this coming Friday (1/29) to secure some cash. I withdrew 10 thousand and the other 35k I will use to gather more shares. 

I'm not going to sit here and pretend I'm some sort of marketing genius. At the end of the day I got very lucky and timed my play right before rush. 

Gamestop was a place I spent a lot of time growing at growing up. They were my favorite place to buy games from! They may have only offered me 20 cents in-store credit for my old Xbox 360 and a handful of games. But what they didn't tell me is that one day they'd give me far more than that. Today Gamestop paid for my college tuition for the remaining 3 years I have in college. Thank you Gamestop. And thank you everyone here. I love you all."|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224314.csv|StockTicker

From the dizzying highs to soul-crushing lows. I even bought a bit more at the midpoint prices of today. From my observations, this is how the institutions conspired to crush the longs in order to give the shorts breathing room to cover.

1. The beginning of the day was intentional. They let fomo run GME all the way into the sky with almost no resistance whatsoever.

2. However, at around 10-10:30 AM EST, something odd happened. The brokers suddenly jacked up their margin requirements for GME. My portfolio previously had a lot of buying power, which suddenly disappeared.

3. We were intentionally allowed to break 150 (which is the highest option strike available) in order to make everyone fomo even harder. Then, the dump came, and it was vicious. At the same time, CNBC started an hour-long segment bashing GME nonstop. Only Cramer provided a bit of token resistance. Every other analyst was calling this move unwarranted and warning that tons of people will be bagholding.

4. As a result, everyone who chased in on margin got fucked. Even my sizeable portfolio was margin called. Fortunately, while I'm retarded, I'm not the most retarded and was not all in GME and was using only a little margin. I was able to cover easily. The unfortunate morons who fomo'd in on margin above today's open were not so lucky. I imagine a lot of retards got liquidated on the way down.

5. The cascading effect let us fill the gap completely and even a little past. However, the important point is that we closed above Friday's close at +18% for the day. I see this as very bullish. So keep holding and don't fucking sell into the fear the other side tried to create. Going forward, stop buying GME on heavy margin. Use cash accounts if possible. Don't let yourself be set up as a domino piece for the shorts to knock over into everyone else.

**TLDR: MMers, brokers, and shorts conspired to screw us. They let us run price up, then jacked up margin requirements, and finally dumped. Despite that, we defended Friday's close quite well so DON'T FUCKING SELL.**"|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224314.csv|StockTicker

More interesting however is that COB for institutional shorts increased from 24.2% to 33.3%. If you didn't already know, COB can increase exponentially if it becomes difficult to find shares to short. So this is something that needs to be paid attention to very heavily. 

Plus, as GME stock price is much higher, this will lead to much more bleeding for the shorts if they try to outlast the longs in this staring contest.

Also, since Melvin Capital is getting a $2.75B capital injection, we can kinda assume that it's either for not getting margin called or closing their bad bets one way or another. This is a very interesting development and looks like longs have to be more patient and needn't be rabid.

Most analysts went from a bear position to a bull position over the course of the year. Analysts and hedge funds have been controlling the stock market for decades but that stops now. We are overthrowing the rule of these funds and bringing power back into the hands of everyday people.

The story of GameStop scares all the hedge funds and it's a huge victory for us. I am excited to see what all we can achieve in 2021, how many millionaires we can create, and how many terrible short selling hedge funds we can decimate. Maybe we can even create a billionaire?

&#x200B;

Day starts with a big gap-up to 95 that is immediately defended. Once again, the 95 price was pivot to the day. First half of the trading with lower than usual volume. The main highlight being the smashing the buy button at $80. Notice how fast and concentrated those candles go up. This is not retail chasing prices.

MMs defended the 95 level during the morning as borrowing fees increased to over 80%. This should tell you something about what was going on in the market. Low volume, short fee jumps, tactical buying moves at certain levels and tightening trading range. At noon, all hell breaks lose.   


Rising volume with rising prices once again, all the way to the other pivot point at $115: the highest open interest strike of 1/29. From here on, its an open highway to tendie town. 

&#x200B;

Unlike yesterday (and the days before), the people buying at this levels are not retailers nor MM hedging. I also don't think is much covering going on (yet). The volume and candles are flowing just on the limit of the circuit breakers as to not lose momentum. Once it starts reaching the 10% threshold, it decelerates ever so slightly as to keep the momentum and avoid trading halts. This is sophisticated.

&#x200B;

Tomorrow I'll be looking for consolidation points to accumulate. Keep tracking OI volumes and key pivot points. They will tell you what's going on.

Shorts recognize that we're almost all into our positions now. The outstanding float that isn't held by us is in their possession minus a few defectors on our side and 5-10% held by others. They are going to do EVERYTHING in their power to bring this down. ""Like what?"" you may ask...

1. Bot brigade negative sentiment on social media, reddit, etc. (this has yet to be common and could be more prevalent soon - though I have seen some new made accounts posting negative sentiment on GME)

1. Buying up the shares we don't have, driving up the price... 

 a) Hoping to create more liquidity for them by reducing our shares (more defectors as price goes up). 

 b) So they can accumulate shares and manufacture large sell offs on volume to create what we saw earlier today

1. Persuade investors on reddit, social media, etc. that there are other better things to buy that will fuck shorts. Yes, there are plenty. But they want to spread us thin. BB, AMC, etc. are just the beginning. If we sell some of our shares to allocate to these and more that will be mentioned over the next couple weeks, we will lose. We will lose not only our strength in GME, but our strength in any focus of any short squeeze.

This is a war. We won the first battle and now they know we mean business. But we haven't won the war. They are going to pull shit that we won't see coming. We will be tested and this will not be easy. But we need to understand that if we persevere through this, we will not only come out rich for our early endeavors (because it's still early in this squeeze) but we will have power in bringing about actual change in the way large funds manipulate prices and how they manage risk. It sounds cliche, but this literally is the turning point. This is where we make history.

This is based off the closest strike price of 150 at the close and the pricing of puts and calls for this level.

Market makers are not pricing GME to go above 220.58  or below 79.50 by the 29th Jan. Above or below those amounts they will start to loose against the options they sold and will need to either defend that level or join the buying to hedge.

I think it's important to see how the sentiment is getting manipulated from outside actors trying to spread FUD- fear, uncertainty, doubt.



1) The most obvious and harmless kind of sentiment-manipulation happens via newspapers and the TV. It's what you'd expect Boomers to write about us. Not accurate at all and probably done out of favor for Hedgefund friends, but also having a very limited effect in times of Reddit, Facebook and Youtube.



2)The weirder part is how sentiment is manipulated on WSB itself. Low karma accounts spreading some kind of hype around low-energy stocks in this subreddit and other stock related subreddits, trying to divert attention. It's not far fetched at all that some of these are hired actors (if I was a billionaire with tons to lose, I'd invest in people trying to divert attention from the hype stock). There's also some ""shouldn't we sell here? Is it really going higher?"" Posts that just feel **off**, like written by someone that isn't molded by WSB lingo. Like by an outsider.



3)Price action. Obviously price action is manipulated to make you doubt yourself and to suppress the price. For this, short spikes that get sold off rapidly is to be expected, because it increases the readiness to take profits at the ""next"" spike. I think that is what we saw yesterday 




What can you do against this?

First; BE AWARE THAT IT IS HAPPENING. Then you can ignore it.


Second; read DD posts and make rational decisions.


Third; Set a price target and stick to it. Don't try to play the swings, instead just buy&hold for your PT.


Fourth; downvote & report shills, share this post to increase awareness about the manipulation and spread positive sentiment if you are bullish. With this I don't mean tons of üöÄüöÄüöÄ or ""1000 is not a meme"" (it is, kind of).

I mean you should comment your legit bull thesis as an answer to FUD.

It's dominating movements in most meme stocks presently. GME likely more dominated by capital inflows this week than short-term gamma (new buyers + short covering vs old sellers), but significant Friday unwind possible at very high price levels (over $115 specifically)**

Finally got good data on option OI this morning. I think GME may be greatly understated on these charts.

[https://imgur.com/a/ZsyuYWu](https://imgur.com/a/ZsyuYWu)

I added a new chart today from SpotGamma. Their product is really great, love it a lot. You have to add the put and call lines together to see dealer behaviors. As you go up in price, they are buying more, so it's kind of inverted in buying effects.

GME: Gamma dominated recently, and gamma dominated in coming months. Less so today at these prices. Gamma ramp falloff after 115, big danger at 60 - sharp ramp. Less volatile  before 110 and after 65 or so. I think spot gamma is slightly understating the total gamma at risk here and think dealers own more.  Additionally, GME has substantial expirations on friday which could cause a meltdown in some scenarios. I don't think that is in the interests of dealers though, so maybe it's more gentle and doesn't drop past 60. In an event that the price absolutely collapsed, they'd lose money.  **But - Really, buying inflows are dominating this as much as gamma is. A lot could happen for bulls or bears here, and the short squeeze is a thing this week and also can have very large imapct, on the order of gamma possibilities or more.**  **I think most price action of this stock to the upside has to be short covering, further retail buying - NOT gamma this week.** there‚Äôs also a dehedging of Friday expiry that will happen throughout the week and will cause things to move, I‚Äôll calculate. Options 30 and 40% out of the money are adding real delta right now. Wow.

**EDIT 12:11pm NY Time Tues: GME Unwind Data:** At the current price of $89, dealers are holding about 6.5m shares long to hedge friday. As we approach Friday, this number drops to about 4.5m, causing weak selling at this price. Once Friday is over, at this price, those 4.5m shares get rolled or sold, which is some moderate selling. At a price of $110, there's buying of about 1.5m shares, followed by a rolling/selling of 8m shares friday. At a price of $59, dealers-shift hedges at 6m shares sold between now and friday, and then friday unload is neutral. In other words, for the price range we are in, there's very slight dealer selling over time. As price goes down, that accelerates even if the price is flat, and friday starts to be a net buy by dealers on friday towards close under 60. For prices over 110, dealers start to net buy leading into friday, then have a large net sell/roll into close. For insane prices, like $120+, dealers hold 11m shares going into friday, which roll off or are delivered or sold. Therefore, in most cases, **Friday unwind is moderate in scope, not large, being half the size of the stack that unwound 2 weeks ago and caused a 10% down day. The entire option stack is loaded however, per the chart. If price is $116+, the unwind is more potent and is similar to 2 weeks ago.**

**PLTR**: Heavy gamma influenced, but less than some of the other stocks. More downside than upside with gamma, but an OK ramp up, not great.

**BBBY**: Gamma dominated. More ramp down than up. Danger in that ramp from 30 to 20. Yikes

**BB**: Gamma influenced, but not dominated, OI is smaller relative to float. Healthy ramp up.

**Edit: After Close Tuesday GME:** My analysis is this looks like primarily new money. Gamma should've only been 8 million shares between open and $120, then a mere trickle after that. I'm sure you guys added some options, so call it 10 or 11. That does mean dealers now have perhaps as much as the float in shares, which is an interesting situation. After that, it was pure retail inflows, likely on the order of over a billion dollars. I think some shorts covered, but borrowdesk had no shares last I checked, so it looks like lots of people short.  Obviously, no one can predict where this can go, but per my prior comments, we are now in a bubble phase. Bubbles pop when capital inflows flip. Lifting each $10 takes the same amount of capital as the last $10, probably a few hundred million dollars per $10 rise, so % changes get harder. Are we at peak inflows today? No idea. But you can cross gamma off the table for now. Gamma isn't driving this right now at these price levels, inflows are driving this. I don't think short covering is a factor because while some shorts are covering, shares still hard to borrow. 

*My positions: was short GME but option OI not juicy enough, so left position. Will enter put spreads if prices are higher ahead of friday, will enter long if prices very low like under $60. Long BB. Long BBBY. Long PLTR via an indirect vehicle. Betting on WSB continue gamma stuff basically.*"|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224317.csv|StockTicker

All right retards,

Some of you may have noticed RH increased their margin requirement on $GME for us. 

This is a GOOD THING. Far too long I have sat on the sidelines in a margin account thinking I was helping out.
Today is the day I transition to a cash account.

Why is this a good thing? Because if I change to a cash account RH can't pimp out my girlfriend $GME to the shorts who so desperately want to DP her sideways.

If you're holding $GME and can't buy anymore because your second mortgage is taking time to process, but you still want to help out, transition to a cash account to protect your GF.

Also, remember this could be a long game, I am begging you from the tip of penis to not get discouraged no matter what happens.

The bomb has not been dropped. When Cohen and the Company release any news, this will blow up. Until then, hold and wait.

I love you all.


Positions shown and I like the stock and truly believe in GME with or without the squeeze (which will cum).

I am not a financial advisor. Any risk you assume is your responsibility.

Why? Because market makers are jacking up margin requirements in an effort to make investors sell GME.

**With margin, you don't even have to lose money to be margin called:**

In this case of GME shares, they simply increased Margin requirements from 100% to 80%. Instead of $20,000 margin for GME, now you can only use $16,000. But you already had $20,000 of margin invested in GME, now they will tell you that you must deposit $4,000 to cover that gap.

**But.**

You can just sell $4,000 of **ANY** positions to fix the Margin Call, you do NOT have to actually deposit $4,000. Robinhood is informative about your options to solve the call but not sure with other brokerages. I commented on Margin on some posts here on WSB, and got a ton of questions about how margin works. **This is for the new guys who don't understand how institutions manipulate and steal from you yet.**

&#x200B;

**How do I know if I am using Margin??**

I only really know for Robinhood users. If you use a different brokerage just google how to find out.

Desktop: Account -> Settings -> Margin Investing (Enabled, Disabled)

Mobile: Profile -> Settings -> Robinhood Gold -> Margin Investing (on/off).

&#x200B;

***TL;DR***: Don't use margin to gamble, especially on extremely volatile stocks like GME! Margin should only ever really be considered for collateral (selling cash-secured puts). And don't be fooled into depositing when you don't have to. Buying on Margin also actually helps the big institutions!

Someone bought around 6000 calls of FUBO 42 strike and then others joined in on the 43 strike. FUBO is a highly shorted stock but one of the main shorts is Kerrisdale Capital, an underperforming fund that is not highly regarded on wall street. Another short seller is Lightshed. Both are probably still in this position even though FUBO actually has long term prospects as a valuable company. 

&#x200B;

As opposed to Melvin Capital that is somewhat well respected on the street (not sure given how retarded they are for going against WSB), these guys are actually full blown retarded even by wall street standards. They've been underperforming heavily and none of the firms are ever gonna step in to save them. 

I think we'll see a heavy short squeeze because these calls are massive. They bought 6000 calls at around 3 premium so that's around 1.8 million in premium paid. You don't put on a bet like that on weeklies unless you want to cause some major pain towards the short selling firm. This is a big ass trade intended to kill.

Why can't Melvin capital just uninstall the Robinhood app and reinstall it to restore their save game and get their money back?????

Reading between the lines, I think Melvin got a margin call that would have wiped out the hedge fund. That would have caused Citadel and Point72 to have a portion of their portion go to $0 which would have hurt their returns. They decided to pump more money into it to prevent bankruptcy. 

Sounds like these hedge funds are vultures coming in to feast on the carcass.

Who is going to bailout Citadel and Point72 when they get squeezed too?

**Citadel LLC and Point72 Asset Management are investing $2.75 billion into hedge fund Melvin Capital Management, which has been hard hit by a series of short bets to start the year.**

The influx of cash is expected to help stabilize Melvin, which has lost 30% for the year through Friday, said people familiar with the firm. Melvin started the year with $12.5 billion and had been one of the best performing hedge funds on Wall Street in recent years. The losses stem from Melvin‚Äôs array of short-bets against companies and have stunned clients and other traders.

Citadel and its partners are investing $2 billion and Point72, which already had more than $1 billion invested in Melvin as of 2019, $750 million. The investments are for non-controlling revenue shares in the hedge fund. Melvin founder Gabe Plotkin was a top portfolio manager at Point72‚Äôs predecessor firm, SAC Capital Management before he left to start Melvin.


It couldn‚Äôt be determined how much of a revenue share Citadel and Point72 would get.

Saw in a post on the options subreddit: 

‚ÄúThe New York Stock Exchange announced that NYSE American *Options* and NYSE  Arca *Options* have revised the quote spread requirement as follows: GameStop(GME) to $20.00 wide, or $25.00 wide when the bid is greater than $100.00, and iRobot (IRBT) to $10  wide.

On top of this they have have lost 30% and January isn't even finished yet. The key here is that now everyone knows the precarious situation Melvin got themselves in. Now think a second about the type of clients that would have their wealth stashed away at Melvin Capital. These are people with so much money that they've never even thought once about what it would be like to work at a Wendy's.  They aren't trying to YOLO their last scrap of savings into weeklies, they're expecting good returns every year and they think they're rich enough that risk doesn't apply to them.

Now they see all over the news that their hedge fund is in SERIOUS trouble.  They see that they almost got margin called on a position with UNLIMITED loss potential.  The first one who realizes this will also realize that their only chance of not losing it all is to be the first one to leave Melvin.  Once that happens the dominos start to fall.

Remember, shares never expire and even without a squeeze the bull target for gme is $169 [gmedd.com](https://gmedd.com).

Not even a mod.

Melvin and all his üåà üêª friends were tilling away to take away the tendies of WSB, blinded by their arrogance and greed that has gotten them so far.

Cramer the once exiled boomer has become a semi-respected boomer for sticking up for retail investors,  but MSM has sided with the MMs for so long, the retards cannot fully trust him.

It is AH and GME is sitting at $89, up 310% in the past week. Your wife has just returned home from the Wendy's you work at with her BF. Not to be forgotten he got you a frosty, your favorite flavor. You eat away merrily as he rails her in the next room, staring at Robinhood and WSB for updates dreaming of tendies. Falling asleep with tendies on your mind with honey mustard dipping sauce.

Boomers and manipulators have been trying to dissuade you and your fellow tards for weeks that GME is a dying business. But Papa RC has come down and spread his loving arms showing a path to greatness. There has been volatility and GUH along the way for those who bought at the top. But they know what is to come. 

The SEC has just finished its preliminary report, and WSB has been deemed a coalition of degenerate gamblers and fetishists of pee drinking cuckholds. Completely innocent of wrongdoing.

The following morning, its 430AM, you open up your trading app, GME is at $690.42 (nice). You roll over on your dog bed to tell Chad and your wife the good news. Market opens: Melvin and Shitron have fled the country and GME is trading at $4206.90. 

You stare at your one share and think.... I made a difference, sell. And go back to sleepies.

May PAPA RC bless us, every one.

We all know the story of $GME and the very real possibility of a substantial short squeeze, the likes of which we have never seen before.  Predictably, retail investors, with a laser focus on /r/WSB, are taking the blame.  CNBC can‚Äôt stop talking about how /r/WSB is ‚Äúcausing‚Äù the short squeeze, trying to characterize a community of random, anonymous, degenerate primates with a legally cognizable entity that can be regulated.  The narrative so far has been that the short squeeze in $GME will cause market-wide sell offs, as we saw this morning when the stock price hit $150.  (They want you to ignore that the market recovered and $GME went from red to up ~20% into close without negative impact to the market at large.)

The facts here are clear.  Shorting GME has been free money for awhile now, but the shorts got greedy and got caught with their pants down.  It is unquestionable that if someone is to ‚Äúblame‚Äù for the short squeeze, should it occur, the blame is solely on the shorts for putting themselves in such an incredibly risky position‚Äîafter all, don‚Äôt they say to ‚Äúinvest at your own risk‚Äù?  Also, no one here in WSB is rich enough to be buying $GME at $100 per share in the thousands.  The other hedge funds smell blood in the water and are eliminating their competition. 

It is also clear that the shorts are bleeding. (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4wh03/we_fucking_did_it_bois/)  

They are going to get desperate. It seems likely that they will infiltrate our freedom of speech haven in order to spread misinformation about $GME. 

First, in the beginning I was concerned about the risk of the company doing an offering and diluting ownership.  However, as I looked into it more, I discovered that even if $GME does an offering, it would be limited to $100M, which is miniscule in relation to GME‚Äôs fair market cap. (See, e.g., https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4coy2/how_likely_is_a_gme_offering/). In other words, if you see headlines or posts talking about a GME offering, they can be ignored as inconsequential.
Second, if you did your research, you will find a bullish PT of $169 as set by GMEDD.com et al. (see https://www.gmedd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GMEdd-GameStopValuation-20Jan21.pdf)   However, you need to bear in mind that the same report set a base PT of $80, which is where we are right about now.  The shorts aren‚Äôt donkey brained, so they will send their peons to infiltrate /r/WSB to try convince people that the ‚Äúbig dogs‚Äù in the GME short play are getting out at this price target and that you will end up being the bag holder.  **THIS IS ALL BULLSHIT THAT SHOULD BE IGNORED** Although I respect the team at gmedd, we all know that a conservative bullish price target is $420.69, and no one with half a brain should consider selling any sooner.

*Ignore those who try to destroy each other from within.  Make sure to report any suspicious activity.*
 
Very truly yours,
/u/shepherd_eyes [position 100 shares at 34.6; Feb19/50C]
 
**TL;DR:  /r/WSB DID NOT CREATE THE SHORT SQUEEZE.  THE SHORT SQUEEZE WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE IF THE SHORTS DIDN‚ÄôT GET THEMSELVES IN THIS POSITION.  *gentle reminder to invest at your own risk and to do your own due diligence.*  THE NEXT STEP FOR THE DESPERATE SHORTS IS TO TURN US AGAINST ONE ANOTHER.  WE MAY BE AUTISTIC, BUT WE ARE NOT STUPID. THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO STAND TO BENEFIT FROM A WSB INSURRECTION ARE THE SHORTS WHO GOT CAUGHT WITH THEIR PANTS DOWN.

You leave the Michelin 3-star restaurant that you decided to bring your wife and her boyfriend to. As you walk to your newly purchased custom made Tesla (codenamed Model G), in the corner of your eye you see your old workplace. You think to yourself¬†*hmm.. brings back memories.*¬†You take out your BlackBerry G1000 and tell SiriQ to drive your wife and her boyfriend home as you cross the street. You think to yourself¬†*wow* *Siri has gotten 10 times better after BB bought over AAPL and merged Siri with QNX.*

As you enter your previous 9-5 abode, you smirk as you say to yourself¬†*Sir, this is a Wendy‚Äôs.*¬†That joke just never gets old. Upon entering you immediately recognize the server. You used to hate him but that hatred has now turned to pity.¬†*Ah I‚Äôll throw him a bone*¬†you think to yourself as you give Andrew the secret hand signal to meet you at the back for the Wendy‚Äôs Special.

You go out back to your usual spot but notice there‚Äôs a homeless man there sleeping in the dumpster. Andrew then says¬†*It‚Äôs $12,200 for a handie*. Exactly the price of one GME share. Oh god‚Ä¶ has he really not covered his short position yet?! You take out your wallet to pay Andrew his fee but he catches you off-guard and snatches it away from you. He throws your wallet to the man in the dumpster and they both made a run for it. In the darkness you vaguely make up the back of the man‚Äôs shirt which read ‚ÄúMelvin Capital‚Äù.

You shake your head as you take out your phone and tell SiriQ to send aid. Two beams of light descend from the sky and blast Andrew & Melvin.¬†*Impressive*¬†you think to yourself as you witness first hand the power of GothamX, a collaboration between Palantir and SpaceX. GothamX blasted a non-lethal laser developed by Tesla from a SpaceX satellite using the pinpoint accurate latitude and longitudes provided by Palantir.¬†*What a technological marvel*¬†you think to yourself.

*What perfect timing*¬†you think to yourself as your self driving Tesla Model G comes back after sending your wife and her boyfriend home. You submit your limit order for 10,000x contracts of Palantir & Tesla FD‚Äôs, get in your Tesla and head home. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

**Topgolf Acquisition**

Topgolf was acquired in an all share purchase value at 2 Billion in October 2020.

Topgolf will issue 2 Billion worth of shares once the merger is approved in early 2021.

(69 Million shares or a 73% increase in float based on current levels)

Topgolf was in talks with multiple banks for an IPO in January 2020 valued at 4 Billion prior to the pandemic. [https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/callaways-topgolf-acquisition-is-a-risky-bet-amid-the-pandemic-191136062.html](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/callaways-topgolf-acquisition-is-a-risky-bet-amid-the-pandemic-191136062.html)

If top golf were to have been listed via IPO it could have easily fetched upwards of 6 Billion + with the recent IPO craze and explosion of growth in golf.

Callaway Golf landed Topgolf at a steal of a price with this 2 Billion dollar acquisition and the current stock price is undervalued based on this alone.

Callaway's market cap after merger will be 4.5 Billion assuming shares issued are based on today's price. ((94+69)\*$28)

The combined company of Callaway and Topgolf is going for less than what Topgolf would of ipo'ed for alone.

Callaway all share transaction will prove beneficial for the company as it utilizes its cash for Topgolf expansion throughout 2021

**Topgolf Breakdown**

Topgolf's 2019 revenues exceeded $1.1 Billion

Topgolf has been growing at a annual Compound Growth Rate = 30%

There are currently 63 locations across the world, up from 51 in 2018

Top golf served over 23 million guests in 2019, with 50% of consumers identifying as non-golfers

Top Golf owns TopTracer - Top Tracer is a leading ball tracing technology that has been purchased and deployed by over 7,500 range bays in the last 3 years. Callaway is looking to install Top Tracer in over 8,000 bays in 2021 and 8,000 annually on a goforward basis.

World Golf Tour - Leading mobile golf game with over 28 million members as of 2019, helping to attract newcomers to the sport

**Growth**

Topgolf is in the early stages of its growth with more than ten years of planned unit growth opportunity in its U.S. venues business and just 2% addressable market penetration in international venues and 1% in the TopTracer Range business. The company has a proven ability to innovate to expand its addressable market and capture the potential of games and content on its interconnected platform.

**Topgolf 2021 Expansion**

In the last 3 months 7 new venues have begun construction, which represents a 11% increase in total venues. Callaway has stated that they will look to expand rapidly with new Top Golf venues post merger. (Hence why they opted to do a share transaction rather then a mix to fund expansion) To put this in perspective, Top Golf only opened 9 venues in the 12 months prior to the merger. They have almost reached their prior years venue growth in the first 3 months post merger.

Top Golf is on track to open 20+ venues in the next 18 months which would represent a 31% increase in venues since merger. Many of these locations will be international, Asia, Dubai, Germany to capitalize on the untapped markets overseas.

**Merger Synergies**

**Brands:**

Callaway's products Ogio, TravisMathew and JackWolfskin brands will be promoted at Top golf locations and will strengthen Callaway's brands. There will be significant growth in merchandise sales and club sales as a result of this merger.

**Used Clubs**

Callaway buys back old sets of clubs from their customers, giving them a credit towards new sets of clubs, and sends/sells the old clubs to be used at Topgolf. This integration will significantly increase the bottom line of Topgolf as they no longer have to purchase clubs from third parties at a premium.

28 million guests that come through the doors each year will have a chance to test out used Callaway clubs. Over 50% of which are newcomers who will most likely opt to purchase the same used brand that they learned on/used at Topgolf. Existing golfers may look to switch their club set to Callaway if they see an improvement in their distance/accuracy. (any golfer knows that you always hit better at the driving range than on the course)

**Overall Market Growth**

The total number of rounds played in the US increased about 12 percent from 2019. This may not seem like a lot but considering that most courses were shut down until June, this growth in the late summer/fall was the largest growth since the Tiger Craze in 1996.

November Play Jumps 57% to Set New Record Rise for 2020 [https://www.thengfq.com/covid-19/](https://www.thengfq.com/covid-19/)

October Play was up 32.2 percent over the same month in 2019.

That followed increases of approximately 14 percent in June, 20 percent in July, 21 percent in August and 26 percent in September.

NGF research shows the number of golfers ages 6 to 17 rose by as much as 20 percent this year. The number of newcomers is close to an all-time high, as is latent demand.

Juniors (6-17) and young adults (18-34) comprise about 35% of all on-course golfers

[https://www.thengfq.com/2020/04/2020-golf-industry-report-available-to-members/](https://www.thengfq.com/2020/04/2020-golf-industry-report-available-to-members/)

Growth in the market means more people buying clubs, and more golfers attending Topgolf during the offseason or their leisure.

**Newcomer Growth and Callaway's Q4 Earnings**

There has been an explosion in growth of newcomers golfing in 2020 thanks to the pandemic. Many of which went their first seasons using used clubs and hand me downs from friends. You can bet your mom‚Äôs Vicodin that Callaway is going to see a surge in their boxing day sales/black Friday sales as newcomers look to purchase new sets of clubs for their first time. In my group of friends alone we went from having 8 buddies in our regular golf group to over 30 thanks to the pandemic. The first thing most of them did after the golf season ended was purchase a new set of clubs. I am expecting a large beat for Q4 revenues with revenues of $390M+ which would represent a 25% increase from Q42019 and 16% revenue beat on estimates thanks to the influx of first year golfers looking to upgrade their used clubs.

**Callaway's Future**

Callaway has transformed from a small, profitable slow growing company to a large, high growth company and should be valued as such. The next couple years Callaway will be key as they continue to open new venues across the globe and integrate Callaway products in venues. Revenues will grow from $1.75 billion in 2020 to $3.5 Billion + in 2021, and expected annual revenue growth at 25%+ for the foreseeable future. If plans are executed properly and debt is managed Callaway is on track to exceed 7 Billion in Sales by 2025 as Topgolf continues to expand internationally as they currently only have 2% of the addressable market.

**Price Target and Valuation**

Price Target raise to $40 from Jefferies [**https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3230379&headline=ELY-Callaway-Golf-price-target-raised-to--from--at-Jefferies**](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3230379&headline=ELY-Callaway-Golf-price-target-raised-to--from--at-Jefferies)

**Price to Sales**

2021 FY Revenue Forecast: $3.6B Topgolf 1.5B (30% CAGR) + Callaway 2.1B

= 28.95/(3,600,000,000/163,000,000)

ELY P/S = 1.31

GOLF P/S = 1.96

ELY P/S Fair Value = $43.31 (28.95\*(1.96/1.31)

This P/S is compared to GOLF which has stagnant revenue growth at 3% YoY growth.

ELY should be valued at a much higher multiple thanks to its 30% CAGR which would label it as a ‚Äúgrowth company and should be valued as such‚Äù. Growth companies have price to sales ratios ranging between 5-15. ELY price target in the $100-$300 range long term using these multiples. Short term it will climb to above $43 to be inline with its peers and will run to above $100 over the next year once Topgolf revenues are reflected.

**Short Interest:**

Callaway historically trades on low volume, averaging 1.6M shares traded daily in January. The current short interest is 19.34% of the float or roughly 16.77 million shares. With the recent climb from $24 to $29 over the past month 1.3 million share sold short covered and closed their position. As $ELY continues to climb and when earnings beats in February shorts will cover and send the price up faster thanks to its wide spreads and relatively low volume.

**TLDR:**

Callaway purchased Topgolf at a fraction of the price it would of IPO‚Äôed for thanks to the pandemic. Topgolf acquisition is undervalued, bringing in CAGR at 30% year over year and will experience growth exceeding 50% in 2021 thanks to Callaway's aggressive venue expansion plans. There are multiple synergies that will benefit both companies as a result of this merger (used clubs, merchandise sales at Topgolf) Callaway will beat their upcoming earnings report thanks to the growth in new golfers during the year. Callaway will triple from these levels over the next couple years and is currently undervalued compared to its peers.

**Position:**

02/19/2021 30C‚Äôs + 02/19/2021 35C's for earnings play will roll them into long term calls after ER.

01/20/2023 40C Long Term play

We saw call prices rocket 50-100% on Tuesday when it rallied 5%, calls have come down since then and are ready to be loaded."|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224320.csv|StockTicker

eSports is on the rise in the United States and the need for a eSports Gaming ""Gamestop?"" League EGL is here. While leagues and competitions can be held online they aren't without their caveats. Differences in internet and computer hardware can prove critical to a gamers ability to perform. 

I believe a physical location with standardized high performance gear and internet is required to go forward if there is to be any more growth and adoption past it's normal target audience.

If done properly and well it could augment GameStop‚Äôs customer base to not only become customers but become the audience and competitors. Matches can be streamed and monetized. Competitors can compete at all levels ""City/State/National"". 

Merchandise, Sponsorships, Partnerships.

But I digress..

**WHY GAMESTOP?!?**

They have the customer base, they have the locations and with a little capital can ramp this up quick. They have even started already‚Ä¶

As a gaming enthusiast I have been waiting for the entrance of a true US eSports giant to rear its head. Much like all sports started with friendly competition, they eventually developed into the jaw dropping revenue producing markets we see today.

The NFL generated 15 Billion in revenue.

The MLB generated 9.9 BIllion in revenue.

Their new revenue streams‚Ä¶

The global gaming peripheral market was worth US$ 3.64 Billion in 2020. A Gaming peripheral is an auxiliary device that provides input and output for the computer and assists in enhanced gaming experience for the user.

https://www.imarcgroup.com/gaming-peripherals-market#:\~:text=The%20global%20gaming%20peripheral%20market,gaming%20experience%20for%20the%20user.

The global esports market size was valued at USD 1.1 billion in 2019 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.4% from 2020 to 2027. 

https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/esports-market

Global gaming chair market size will grow by almost USD 66 million during 2019-2023, at a CAGR of more than 5%. The gaming industry has been evolving in the digital age owing to the introduction and popularity of PC games and gaming consoles such as Xbox and PlayStation. The PlayStation 4 Pro and the Xbox One X can render games at 4K resolutions with HDR color technology, which will result in an increasing demand for gaming consoles among end-users.

**The Conclusion...**

There is a lot of untapped revenue potential in the eSports US market. 

There is a need for a physical presence in the United States where by other country standards we are spread so far apart.

Utilizing a company with existing framework built around gaming is a boon. 

Buying quality internet, high quality gaming computers is a fairly low cost of entry.

Streaming the competitions will only bring more eyes, interest, business.

Now that Melvin is bankrupt, their position goes to their broker which are the big banks. Now, the banks want to close the position, but there are no paper hands in GME. They want to pay up, with Melvin money but there is none.

They can't even liquidate Melvin long portfolio and pay for their grim mistakes, a sacrifice offering not available.

So here is the problem, we can't win against the banks. If we are winning against the bank, our big boys in GME will get a talk with big brother.

Now if you read my post history you will find out that I am permabull holding $BB shares from $3 to $20. This is not why I am writing this DD on üöÄGMEüöÄ, no, full stop. I want üöÄGMEüöÄ brothers to go to one trillion dollars, because I know at the end of the day some of that will come to the deep value play of $BB.

The issue is if the banks who are soon forced to hold bankrupt short position cannot cover because of  üíéü§ö  =   üöÄ   üöÄ   üöÄ . Then there is a big problem, now the problem is not big right now since the market cap is only 10B on   üöÄ GME  üöÄ , but lets say we 10x again and head to 100B, one trillion, then this will bring down big banks.

On the eve of this lamentous day, I think it's important to say that it's always best to overstate/oversell your winnings to friends and family, I, for instance, always tell without asking, and then give a figure around 50/60% of the real figure after reversing the signs.

**There are a multitude of reasons for doing this:**

* People will otherwise, understand the little work and effort you have taken to lose your entire savings, bosses will expect you to start working wage-free

* You will need to go back into hiding from friends and family whom you've also ruined

* Can't pay taxes when you're dead (that's a plus)

* You can still gain it back buying the dip (I am taking out a loan on my wife's house and ring and going on an investment binge after boyfriend finishes her insane ride)

* The money was a running tap and your dumb ass blew it.

* Money is so much easier to make than spend so please be stoic

That's all I have to say. Have a quiet cry and jerk when you do cash out (below -$1000 of course), or come up with some other tale about how you totally sold at a vastly more opportune time than you really did.

GME the depths of your rock bottom ego üçÜüçÜüçÜ  (BB üöÄüöÄüöÄ tho) Godspeed bois

BlackBerry today announced an expansion of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX¬Æ Neutrino¬Æ Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.).

The milestones build on the company‚Äôs [January 2018](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) agreement to make BlackBerry QNX‚Äôs industry-leading ISO 26262 ASIL D certified operating system (OS) the foundation for Baidu's ‚ÄòApollo‚Äô autonomous driving open platform.

Baidu is one of the few high-definition map vendors with an Automotive SPICE¬Æ certification from T√úV Rheinland ‚Äì an industry certification that addresses rigid requirements for the software development process for Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive suppliers. With world-leading levels of data granularity, Baidu‚Äôs high-definition maps provide a critical component for global automakers looking to launch next generation connected and autonomous vehicles in China.

The QNX Neutrino RTOS foundation for Baidu‚Äôs high-definition maps is a robust real-time microkernel operating system that provides deterministic performance as well as flexibility to address the limited resources of the embedded system.

‚ÄúWith BlackBerry QNX's embedded software as its foundation, Baidu has made significant progress as part of its Apollo platform in establishing a commercial ecosystem for innovative technologies that OEMs can leverage for their next generation vehicles,‚Äù said Dhiraj Handa, VP, Channel, Partners and APAC, BlackBerry Technology Solutions. ‚ÄúWe look forward to continuing to work closely with Baidu to help develop and deploy leading edge autonomous driving and connected vehicle technologies to meet the ever-increasing mission-critical and security requirements of the automotive industry.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe aim to provide car manufacturers with a clear and fast path to the production of autonomous vehicles, with safety and security as the top priority. The BlackBerry QNX software performs well in functional safety, network security and reliability, while Baidu has achieved long-term development in artificial intelligence and deep learning. Together, we can help car manufacturers quickly produce safe autonomous vehicles and promote the development collaboratively of the intelligent networked automobile industry,‚Äù said Wang Yunpeng, Senior Director of Technology Department of Baidu‚Äôs Intelligent Driving Group.

**About BlackBerry QNX**

Point72 and Citadel didn‚Äôt invest $2.75B to protect Melvin from retail investors.


IPoint72 and Citadel invested $2.75B to protect Melvin *from other whales*.


Steven Gohen (Point72) and Ken Griffin (Citadel) are two guys bailing out their buddy/former mentee who got himself in quite the pickle Gabe Plotkin (Melvin Capital). After all, these whales HAVE money, WANT MORE money, and at the very least, will do whatever it takes to not LOSE money.


But you know who else likes money? 


*Other whales.*


And you know who is likely to have deep, systemic, hyper competitive, anti-establishment, vendettas against whales that can only be resolved with financial warfare? 


*Other whales.*


Now, I haven‚Äôt done the math (I‚Äôm too autistic) but it seems pretty obvious to me that there‚Äôs now way more money (and ego points) to be made in slaying whales ie. institutional money, shorts, than slaying the minnows ie. retail money longs.


Point72 and Citadel have marked themselves as targets. They‚Äôre exposed, and can be flanked at any moment.


This seems like the perfect entry point for whales to strike down their opponent(a), settle a feud, seek revenge, make a big bag, and cover/up behind the (perceived) stupidity of retail. 



Chamath is already teasing about entering the fray on his Twitter, we know he‚Äôs cool with bankrupting billionaires. How many whales could join him, if he chooses to long-$GME? 


Thoughts?

Edit: Keep in mind, this isn‚Äôt just limited to $GME. These funds hold massive amounts of positions all across the market. They‚Äôre playing a Finite Game defending Melvin, in a sandbox with pseudo-Infinite Players that will wage this fight for non-$GME related reasons 

To use an analogy, this is the shorts are like USA occupying a foreign nation in the Middle East. Everyone there knows who the USA is, but the USA cannot distinguish who it‚Äôs true enemy/adversary is (the factions are too fragmented, too many players).


(I am not a financial advisor, I don‚Äôt know how to do anything except buy $GME stock on RH. Please don‚Äôt take this as advise. Do your own DD. Have fun. Be safe. Don‚Äôt go full retard)."|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224320.csv|StockTicker

**4:00 AM**

Light skirmishes started early with retards from the 136th Armored Idiots surprising the enemy and taking substantial ground out of the gate. Caught off guard, the enemy was driven back on their heels. The boost in morale was immediate and would reverberate through the rest of the bloody day.

**5:00 AM**

The enemy awoke to chaos and confusion, but managed a minor rally, driving the 136th back into the arms of the 103rd Sleepy Retards. They would go on to put up a valiant fight and suffer many casualties in the coming hours. The fighting was sporadic but intense at times.

**6:00 AM - 9:30 AM**

Skirmishes continued between the lines of the 90th Diamond Dildos and 103rd. Battle lines were drawn and troop positions massed in these key early hours. The skirmishing saw gains come and go and would telegraph the bloody day to come.

**9:30 AM - 11:30 AM**

In an explosive maneuver, general [u/deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue/) assembled and unleased the full might of the 159th Weaponized Autists. The fighting was sustained, intense, and bloody. The 159th gained ground at an alarming rate and it appeared as if total capitulation of the enemy was imminent. Troops that managed to penetrate deep into enemy territory reported seeing the enemy General Left stuff mouthfuls of crayons into his face and shit waxy rainbows.

**11:30 AM - 1:00 PM**

We underestimated the resolve of the enemy. A flanking move by General Melvin took the 159th in the rear and scattered our troops. The fear caused a substantial complement of our soldiers to desert and run for the hills on the spot. I have not words for these cowards. At the same time, I saw good men - nay, great men - of the 159th, 150th, 140th, 130th, 120th, 110th, 100th, 90th, and 80th cut down en-masse. I will not speak further of this here other than to say that they will be avenged and see their names carved into the stones of Valhalla itself.

**1:00 PM - 4:00 PM**

I can only note here the deep pride I feel in my men and in my cause. I am not an emotional man, but what I saw with mine own eyes today would evoke emotion in the stoniest of hearts. After what appeared to be a stunning reversal and brief loss of ground, my men dug in their heels and fought like legends out of my childhood stories. Ground was given and taken over the next few hours, but at the end of the day, the enemy was driven back. My heart is filled with pride and hope for the future.

This day will not be forgotten.

1. 5G supercycle is just starting üòé. You've probably heard about 5G for like 2 years but there weren't any handsets out that actually supported true 5G. Now, however, the iPhone 12 fully supports 5G and so do some Android devices. Now there's consumer supported hardware we're going to start seeing real 5G being deployed.
2. WTF is real 5G? The 5G you see right now is fake. Cell companies basically took shitty old bandwidth and combined it to create the illusion of 5G. Real 5G requires more bandwidth in the form of 'C-band'. The FTC's auction for that just closed and the US wireless carriers alone spent an obscene $80 BILLION to buy that bandwidth ([https://www.satellitetoday.com/5g/2021/01/19/c-band-auction-sets-record-grossing-81m-in-phase-one/](https://www.satellitetoday.com/5g/2021/01/19/c-band-auction-sets-record-grossing-81m-in-phase-one/))
3. So what the fuck does this mean? Basically, all that bandwidth they just spent $80b üíµüíµüíµüíµ on needs to be deployed. That means buying new equipment and hanging that shit on a bunch of cell towers. Can you guess who makes that equipment? NOKIA. They were actually the first to demonstrate C band in the US ([https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/06/19/nokia-first-to-demonstrate-live-c-band-network-in-the-us/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/06/19/nokia-first-to-demonstrate-live-c-band-network-in-the-us/))
4. This is going to generate a huge amount of revenue. This article here estimates $3.6b of equipment per carrier ([https://www.lightreading.com/5g/nokia-samsung-ericsson-start-salivating-over-5g-sales-for-c-band/d/d-id/761874](https://www.lightreading.com/5g/nokia-samsung-ericsson-start-salivating-over-5g-sales-for-c-band/d/d-id/761874)). That means the carriers are going to spend upwards of $10B on new 5G equipment in the NEAR-TERM JUST IN THE US.
5. 5G is going to be deployed GLOBALLY üåé. It is going to unlock incredible use-cases (autonomous vehicles, augmented reality etc) The US alone is a $10b+ opportunity. Then you have China, Europe, and a bunch of other countries that want some good 5G. China Mobile is already working with Nokia (see here: [https://www.thefastmode.com/technology-solutions/18904-nokia-china-mobile-complete-live-trials-of-ai-powered-5g-ran](https://www.thefastmode.com/technology-solutions/18904-nokia-china-mobile-complete-live-trials-of-ai-powered-5g-ran))
6. If you don't understand the importance of NOK, you should look at the actions of the US govt - they are actually trying to buy a stake in the company - NOK is a systemically important global infrastructure provider ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-08/finland-is-building-its-nokia-stake-in-response-to-u-s-interest-ketqcpo7](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-08/finland-is-building-its-nokia-stake-in-response-to-u-s-interest-ketqcpo7))
7. In 2019, NOK had just 23B EUR of REVENUES. The 5G opportunity is multiples of that and it's literally just getting started.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1.) COVID vaccine rollout has started, and we will be able to attend movies soon. The Biden Administration (sorry for getting political, just pls keep reading) has an ambitious plan (100 million vaccines in 100 days or whatever the fuck) and this pandemic is almost over. I‚Äôd give it until the end of the year.

2.) **Most** [**AMC**](https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-ent-movie-theaters-reopening-0123-2021) **theatres** [**are open**](https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean#locations) or they are planning to open soon with social distancing and mask measures in place. They will shut down the food services and concessions, but they are coming back.

3.) **Consumers have a sentimental connection to movies. They will come back**. People are starved for the outside world and will come out in massive hordes to watch movies. People will go out and see movies, take their kids, go on dates, etc. Nothing can replicate the experience of a giant screen and surround audio.

4.) This major influx of blue balled movie goers will cause a major boost in 2021. Then we will see a continuation of the year over year growth we have been seeing since 2012.

5.) The AMC business model is working. The revenue has steadily increased since 2012 year over year. [**In 2012, they made $811 million. In 2019, they made $5.47 billion.**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/206959/revenue-of-amc-theatres/) There has been a steady rise. **THEY ARE NOT IN DECLINE.**

6.) I understand they have many loans, but it is something that can be paid off in a few years with the help of their parent company, Wanda Entertainment, and increased profits in 2021.

7.) They will not go bankrupt. WANDA entertainment, a Chinese company owns the plurality share (20%) and will bail them out if it is necessary. They bought for $2.6 billion in 2012, and have seen a ROI, scoring $2.7 billion in 2013, the year immediately after their purchase. AMC is too good of an asset for Wanda to lose them. Also, AMC can take advantage of new stimulus and other government assistance programs.

8.) It‚Äôs extremely cheap right now because everybody is shorting, and there‚Äôs a pandemic. Corona is only temporary. Everybody thought GameStop was going to go under, until we showed them. Remember that.

9.) If there is interest or heightened trading in the stock, AMC can dilute shares and sell them to help finance operations and pay debt, using stock sales as leverage. AMC just did this today, and they can do it again if needed.

10.) AMC will not go bankrupt, not only because of the potential Wanda bailout, but [**they also raised $917 million today. They have enough runway to stay operational the end of the year. ""Bankruptcy is off the table for now.""**](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/25/amc-ceo-adam-aron-on-917m-financing.html) (We should be able to return to theatres by then.) A slight majority of this new liquidity comes from issuing new shares, as described in 9. They are also planning to do debt/equity swaps, so those who take out debt can hold shares in the company, and AMC won't get fucked over by high loan payments.

11.) [**AMC is about 70% shorted**](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)**, there is much potential to cause a squeeze**. However, there are still many more reasons to invest in AMC beyond a simple short squeeze.

12.) AMC does very well when it is not pandemic. $5.4 billion in revenue last year, and there will be many movies, as well as many moviegoers that come out after the pandemic. Especially with major franchise movies, which have been delayed. They [have also reached a deal with Universal, which allows Universal to do home releases earlier, but stipulates they must be in theatres for 17 days before that.](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/universal-amc-deal-theaters-pandemic-1234801134/)

13.) AMC is only $5 a share right now... Even if it loses, you‚Äôre not going to lose much. Meanwhile, the ceiling is high, and there is much potential. If you want in, do it now while it's cheap. People keep talking about how dumb it is to buy during the pandemic, but this is the point of largest potential. Don't wait for the recovery to buy.

14.) AMC used to trade at $10 before the pandemic. Let‚Äôs bring it back to its former glory. AMC deserves a $1bn market cap and they will get one. They will probably hit $7 tomorrow (predicting $10 by Feb1, peak in summer with COVID all done.).

15.) Even though the Net income is negative and they lose money, it consistently stays in the hundred thousands range, and it does not lose that much. Any autist on here from GME could pay the difference. [**AMC has also increased gross profits year over year, from 2,004,200 in 2016, to 3,493,200.**](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amc)

*(The rest of these bullet points are just jokes, so feel free to skip if you want.)*

16.) Without AMC there‚Äôs no place to spend my AMC points, and there better be a place for me to spend those points because I invested my entire life savings into those damn AMC stubs.

17.) Going to the movies was my childhood. We must save my childhood. DO NOT LET AMC DIE. Save AMC.

18.) You can take ur wife and her bf to the movies when this is over.

19.) The AMC food court literally sells tendies. (But we should call AMC tendies popcorns instead.)

20.) **STONCCS only go up.**

21.) you guys are all retard who cannot think for themselves and will do whatever is echoed in this fucking internet cave.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TL;DR : AMC has done a great job with fundraising and can survive until the end of the year. Vaccine rollout has started, and recovery is coming soon. People are due to return to movies. About 70% of shares are shorted, so we can potentially trigger a squeeze.

# Pandemic recovery & squeeze combo.

**Buy AMC. Or don‚Äôt. Your choice.**

**If you‚Äôre with us, let's save the movies. I hope you like popcorn. Get on the rocket, because you're going to the moon.**

**If you don‚Äôt, then bye bye, I wish you the best.**

On the eve of this great day, I think it's important to say that it's always best to understate/undersell your winnings to friends and family. I, for instance, will only tell when asked, and then give a figure around 50/60% of the real figure.


**There are a multitude of reasons for doing this:**

1. People do not understand the hard work and risk you have taken for these gains, and so will expect them for free

2. Manipulative people will come out of the woodwork

3. You may have taxes yet to pay (I know it sucks)

4. You may lose all of this money yet (I am taking an investing break after this insane ride) 

5. The money is not a running tap, and is lump sums, so don't build a lifestyle around it 

6. Money is so much easier to spend than to make, please be sensible

That's all I have to say. Have a quiet cigar or champagne when you do cash out (above $1000 of course), or come up with some other excuse as to where the money came from.

I honestly have moved on since then, and didn‚Äôt really understand 100% of how it all broke down, and plus that was a long time ago, so let‚Äôs start with a clean slate scenario:

* Let‚Äôs say I earn 1000 giving hand-jobs near the dumpster behind Wendy's, and put it in my brokerage acct.
* At this point, I have earned 1000.
* I buy Stonk ABC, and the value doubles. I sell one week later, and now have $2000. I take that money out and hold it in my hand, rub it on my face, put it in my pants, etc.
* This year, I have earned $2000. So far, so good.
* Now I take the 2,000, put it BACK in my brokerage, and yolo that 2,000 into Stonk DEF. It moons, and I now have 10,000 in my brokerage. I withdraw that money, hold it in my hand, and rub it on my wife's BF‚Äôs pecs as he hits wifey from behind.

**At this point I have made‚Ä¶ what? Is it 10,000? Or is it 12,000?** I earned 2,000 *earlier* (and rubbed it on my face, put it in my pants), then put it BACK INTO the brokerage, and then pulled it out again as (a new?) 10,000.

Does that 10,000 add to the 2,000 I made earlier, or is the IRS aware that the 2,000 ***went back in*** and only 8,000 NEW money came back out? This is honestly where I think I got fucked a few years back.

TurboTax was telling me my earnings were way higher than any total I ever had available to throw on my floor and roll around in, and I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was like ‚Äúyou made 2000, then (like a fucking idiot) you put it back in the casino and bought 2,000 worth of chips (which we think is stupid, but hey, you do you), then one week later left the casino with a new 10,000 that we never saw before‚Äù.

I think since I was moving money out of FailBase and into WellsFucko, they added up all the extractions, without taking the ‚Äútake profits, buy dip, sell peak, take profits, buy next dip, sell next peak‚Äù into consideration. Yes I ended up above where I started, but MINUS the parts that went back in, that number was way smaller that what they saw. All they saw was ‚ÄúSell, Sell, Sell, those all add up to $fuckyou,payme.00‚Äù, essentially ignoring the ‚Äúand then I buy back in‚Äù.

Now I use an actual brokerage, and see there are unrealized gains, etc, but it‚Äôs taking the Buy and Sell portions into effect, and saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre UP this portion *overall*‚Äù.

Am I retarded? It seems pretty straightforward, but last time I did this I kinda got fucked.

My acquaintances are talking about buying $GME puts because they believe this rally cannot be sustained. My question is technical: How does buying a put influence this miracle of a rally unfolding before our eyes? Does it add fuel to the squeeze? Thank you, you wonderful, smartest retards I have ever dreamed to encounter.

Also, long $GME 14 shares @ $88. Sorry for being poor.

GME's float is [~27.29 million shares](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/FloatPercentageOfTSO/GME/Float-Percentage-Of-Total-Shares-Outstanding/GameStop-Corp). So more shares were sold short today than the total float of GME. That equates to roughly 70,000 shares sold short *every fucking minute* of the trading day **today**, and GME still ended 16% up. They can't keep this up forever. 

All of that is not to say that short interest necessarily increased. Shares trade hands and shorts cover. We'll see when updated estimated short interest with today's data is made available tomorrow. I just wanted to share these absurd facts about just how many GME shares were sold short today.

I myself only have shares, but my gains are, well, let's just say I'm not comfortable sharing my success. There are people in this sub that earned even more than I did because they went into options; do I envy them? No, I say good for them. Everyone has their own preferred game to play; mine is that involving shares. I'm happy with what I earn. In fact, this month I made more than what I earn in a year.

Yes, yes, I know, you need a large sum of money to have that kind of gains from shares only, but hey, I'm in my late 20s and I sacrificed a lot of things that average joes in their 20s do and managed to save enough money to have a good principle for my portfolio (I haven't transferred additional money in more than a year). My gains may not be as impressive as those who YOLOed on GME and BB calls, but I'm still proud of what I earned because I believe I earned it, and you should too for your gains.

Alright plebs, listen up, I‚Äôm about to hit you with some knowledge. If you find reading difficult and options easy, there is a TL;DR at the bottom.

Disclaimer: I am long NOK shares I bought back on Loyal3 if you can remember that long ago. Currently 1,000 shares and 10 call contracts with Jan 2023 expire 50% 5c and 50% 7c,.

I‚Äôve been waiting ages to write this DD and contribute to the community. I couldn‚Äôt be more excited that Nokia is finally getting the attention they deserve. Their engineers have been hard at work for YEARS and their stock has not show them the appreciation they deserve.

**5G Patents:**  Nokia has over 3,000 5G Patent Declarations: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/03/24/nokia-announces-over-3000-5g-patent-declarations/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/03/24/nokia-announces-over-3000-5g-patent-declarations/)

**Current 5G contracts:** Global.

The latest significant 5G contract has been with the Port of Seattle.

NASA - $14.1 million, to start, if you don‚Äôt trust Reddit, NASA did your DD for you.

More information about current contracts: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/01/09/nokia-highlights-momentum-with-63-commercial-5g-deals/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/01/09/nokia-highlights-momentum-with-63-commercial-5g-deals/)

$600 million to Nokia and Ericsson for the United States Department of Defense.

With the Peoples Republic of China Telecom, oh I mean Huawei being removed from the United States and allies, that removes a major competitor from the market place.

**Phones:**  You got it. They are back, and they are good. I waited for ages to finally buy one, and its all they hyped it up to be. They are in the phone market to stay.

All of these figures will be 12 month trailing to 2017, in order, in thousands.

**Gross Profit:** $8,472,000 > $8,326,000 > $8,446,00 > $9,139,000

**Net Income:** $734,000 > $7,000 > -$340,000 > -1,494,000

**Operating Cash Flow:** $2,469,000 > $390,000 > $360,000 > $1,811,000

**Free Cash Flow:**  $1,936,00 > -$300,000 > -$312,000 >  $1,210,000

By lining these up we can see where management payed off debts, and made investments into the organizations future, a strategy, that by looking that the trailing twelve months, is paying off.

How has gross profit remained somewhat stable while net income increased? They have lowered operating expenses.

2019 ‚Äì 2017

**Total Assets:**  $39,128,000 > $39,517,000 > $41,024,000

**Total Liabilities:**  $15,401,000 > $15,371,000 > $16,218,000

He has also cracked down on senior management telling them its time to shape up or ship out:  [https://www.lightreading.com/opticalip/nokia-managers-at-risk-as-ceo-warns-it-may-be-time-for-change/d/d-id/766184](https://www.lightreading.com/opticalip/nokia-managers-at-risk-as-ceo-warns-it-may-be-time-for-change/d/d-id/766184). I think this will light the fire that is needed to get the organization back on track.

All of this comes together to equal a highly undervalued company that has they key indicators of growth and stability.

Nokia for the win.

Will retail investors continue to squeeze out shorts? Let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a wild stock market, with the markets starting off in the green before having a drop in early morning trading but eventually finishing off with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/xhtxHrZ) gaining 0.69%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/6mykhfj) rising by .36% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/vDQsrLs) lost 37 points as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/tMyRKvN) rose by almost 6% and was even over 26 at one point.

We finished the day with 55% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/SvJnHLr) declining on average volume with the number of companies above the moving averages remaining pretty much the same as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/zVkwnQK) actually finished in the green, with Utilities and Consumer Staples leading the way while Energy was the biggest laggard, dropping just over 1%, but recovered from the lows of the day.

Large-Cap Growth Companies were [outperforming](https://ibb.co/8sM97kV) the markets while the rest of the groups were underperforming as big tech managed to stay positive through the lows as you can also see in yesterday‚Äôs [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/JKNzC7f), with Apple, Microsoft & Tesla leading the way, while Banks & Industrials joined the Energy sector in losing ground.

[Today](https://ibb.co/hdnyZsJ) we start the day off with Redbook chain store sales, the Shiller Home Index, Consumer Confidence and a lot of earnings reports from the likes of JNJ, 3M, as we also have [possible](https://ibb.co/9T4w2f0) volatility in Li Auto, GE, Freeport and Plug Power, before the big tech earnings start to trickle in after-hours with AMD, Microsoft & Starbucks

I‚Äôll be watching to see what JNJ may announce on their vaccine progress while AMD will be under the spotlight to see if they manage to continue to take market share from Intel.

In some other stock market news, we continued to see small stocks having a wild ride, as the battle of the short‚Äôs vs WSB continues. This has become a major battle with multiple heavily shorted stocks gaining massive in the last days & weeks.

And though I don‚Äôt encourage anyone to seek such high and fast returns, these events can last long enough to break the short-sellers as this event can keep on going for an unknown period of time before the fundamentals of the company retake center stage, so don‚Äôt try and fight the market, if you don‚Äôt seek high volatility, it‚Äôs just better to avoid getting to much exposure to these names.

You should seek long-term capital gains, as you can see [here](https://ibb.co/x3Zhjx5), the probability of you having negative return keeps getting lower and lower the longer your time horizon gets. You can just gamble and have a 54% chance of having a positive gain in any random day, but as you move the time-frame along, that chance goes to 94% if you invest for 10years which is pretty much as safe as you can get in money investment, as staying invested is the best way to go, just look at this [chart](https://ibb.co/ssgvs70) through March, staying invested had turned 1$ into over 15$ in under 30 years, while missing the 25 best days only managed a return of about 5$. But missing both the best & worst 25 days did have a higher return, though timing the market is nearly impossible as markets can act irrational for a very long time and you might start to wonder when is the actual [time](https://ibb.co/28z6hTZ) to sell or buy, while in reality, no one knows what the markets will do in the short-term and trying to predict that is pure speculation and a waste of time that could be used for long-term investing.

You can also see that there isn‚Äôt any political effect usually to [investing](https://ibb.co/mD6kQ5s), as the probability of the stock market rising in any year doesn‚Äôt depend that much on what is the year of the term of the current president, though you can see a slightly bigger chance in the first year of a Presidential term.

And one last thing I wanted to talk about is the type of [assets](https://ibb.co/ysw2yQn) I think are best suited for the current situation. As you can see the SP500 has largely outperformed most other asset classes, but I think this might change this year, with small-caps being more exposed to an improving economy and international stocks benefiting from further QE easing in the US, which will make the dollar weaker, thus increasing the returns you can get in international stocks.

So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/1vsT3vM) are pointing to flattish open, with the Dow Jones leading the way.

For all you longs out there, here's something to be hopeful about:

GME filled its gap TODAY. I'm under the full belief that massive gap-ups are always retraced. If it didn't retrace today, it would have collapsed tomorrow or next week, which could have easily marked a top for shorts. EVEN IF GME CLOSED 5% UP FROM FRIDAY, THAT IS STILL A STRONG SIGN.

Sup retards.

&#x200B;

I have seen a fuckload of people comparing the VW squeeze to the GME squeeze and heres why that is an absolutely retarded thing to do:

&#x200B;

**1) Time and Tech**

* I don't think this REALLY needs to be said, but the VW squeeze happened in 2008. GME squeeze is happening in 2021. There are some key differences here:
   * Quicker trades:  Back in 2008, online brokerages were really just beginning, with a low number of users. That means that things went quite a bit slower than they do now. Instead of months, this squeeze will take weeks.

**2) Players**

* **Retail was not significantly involved in the VW squeeze.** We are seeing massive swings in price because retail is involved, buying, and more importantly **selling** significantly. Also, retail trading of GME calls is leading to increased volatility that just wasn't there in the VW squeeze. **Therefore, comparing the chart of the VW squeeze to the GME chart is just retarded.**

**3) Ratio of shares sold short to available shares**

* **The GME squeeze CANNOT and WILL NOT be bigger than the VW squeeze for one reason: MATH.** In the VW squeeze, the ratio of Available shares to Short shares was 1:12. This means that for every share that was available to cover with, 12 were sold short. **This IS NOT, and NEVER HAS been the case with gamestop. At its peak, gamestop had a ratio of 1:2.56 of available float, and roughly 1:1.07 total float.**
   * Knowing this, mathematically the GME squeeze WILL NOT BE GREATER than the VW one. ~~we will likely see it top off at around 3-500 Maximum.~~
      * Yes, I know that the VW squeeze could've gone higher if it hadn't been for people helping them out of their short positions, but they were in an entirely different situation with a ratio of 1:12 than any of the shorts are with a ratio of 1:2.56 (maximum)

I could go more in depth with this, but I'm not going to. hopefully you guys can understand it.

**TL:DR: GME squeeze IS NOT the VW squeeze and they really** ***CANNOT BE COMPARED ON ANY INTELLECTUALLY HONEST MERIT.***

Comparing the two charts ""guys we are just in the dip, HOLD!!!11!"" is **PURELY CONFIRMATION BIAS and should be taken with a grain of salt.**

&#x200B;

edit: there has been a lot of great discussion in this thread and there is something i'd like to address:

This situation is completely new: we have so many other variables that have never been seen in the market driving this crazy rocket ship, and there is no way to accurately predict a top, bottom, etc on this. Because of this, I have edited out my ""estimation"" of a top, because I think that there is really no way for me to accurately find that number for you guys, and dont want to be misleading. 

Though I tried to use previous short squeezes in history to predict the top by adjusting variables, there is really no way for me to accurately do this, I realize it all comes down to estimation and speculation, and it would be dishonest for me to assert a top without knowing any of this for sure. 

That being said, still dont compare these two squeezes (especially the chart for fucks sake) , and GME üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ"|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224320.csv|StockTicker

This is why Nokia will boom in 2021. Like $BB, it is no longer a phone company, but is now a major contender in 5G, autonomous driving, AI tech and cyber security. In fact, it almost sounds like a better blackberry with more upside potential. $NOK is trading at $4.75 at the time of writing. It saw a steady decline since it's previous high of $5 in August of 2020, but has since recovered in the last 4 months. 

The reason for the initial selloff was a corporate decision to cut jobs to free up cashflow for large projects going forward. At this time they also halted dividends which pissed off some older retirees, as expected. Now here is the various reason this stock can deliver massive returns in the next 12-36 months.

**Selected for U.S. Federal 5G Security Project**

The project is to ensure a secure transition from 4G to 5G because of the various risks perceived by the general public, to whom security comes above all else. Nokia will provide both software and hardware solutions, and work with both NCCoE and Government to implement.

**Nokia wins Belgian 5G contracts as Huawei ousted**

To put it short, Nokia was chosen to implement 5G technology in Belgium as US continued to put pressure on literally everyone to end business with Huawei over potential security threats.

**5 Year Deal with T-Mobile**

T-Mobile will be using Nokia's Airscale Radio Platform to scale up 5G deployment. As well as this, Nokia will personally facilitate T-Mobiles upgrade from LTE to 5G, which is by all means a large project

**Partnership with Google Cloud**

Googles cloud computing services will be working together with Nokia to help businesses transform their network connectivity through the implementation of 5G and new cloud capabilities.

**Contract Secured with Tele2 in Sweden**

The amount has not been disclosed but it involves deploying 5G infrastructure for Tele2 subscribers in Sweden, to improve network performance and security. They will also use Nokia's NetAct Cloud Management system to improve management and security of sensitive subscriber data.

**Partnership with M1 to build Singapore 5G Ecosystem**

Together with M1, Nokia will implement their 5G standalone core to deliver advanced network capabilities to Singapore. The 5G Standalone core tech allows operators to design and automate network slices to further development of unmanned aerial or road vehicles, remote operations, wireless e-health, etc...

TL:DR

Nokia is not a phone Company. Major contender in the 5G space, cybersecurity AND AI autonomous vehicle operation. Partnerships with other large companies in both the US and abroad have set the stage for NOKIA to dominate 5G, which has the potential to see more growth than any other industry in 2021. Also have more upside potential as Huawei continues to lose contracts due to US pressure and potential security threats.

**Context**

Melvin Capital was bailed out today\[1\]. They were close to liquidating their position but were rescued. This is supported by the fact that as GME passed the 115 gamma ramp and headed to 150, the rest of the market was going red, likely from Melvin liquidating. This could have caused a cascading effect across other funds an positions, but that's another post. What is evident was that Melvin Capital was likely about to start liquidating but was rescued by Plotnik's Papa Steve Cohen with 2.75B \[1\]

I'll describe how Melvin Capital will likely try to countermove their weak position. Everything I write is conjecture, and would be a very low investable thesis but let's continue with the white boarding.

The GME 60C is the beginning and the end for you guys. Huge amounts of call buying and delta hedging occured at this strike. 10s of Millions of shares are linked to these derivatives.

Melvin's Capital goal is to not be forced into a short squeeze. You guys want the the infinite short squeeze to be triggered. MM/Citadel Securities provides the price discovery on how expensive each countermove is for the actors in this game.

Melvin Capital is likely not to double down on naked shorts with the new funds because if he loses in that move, Plotnik's career is over and may face criminal charges for abusing his fudiciary duties by doubling down with more naked short selling.

We saw today how someone forced GME share price to drop over 10% and force halts, thereby dropping off vega and killing off any gamma ramping. It happened over and over. So we know that's what they tactically want to do.

Steve Cohen's, famous hedge fund manager, has a favorite play. He would create massive call and put walls around a strike price to kill off vega and prevent gamma, and collect premium. In ELI5, Cohen would put up massive blocks of expensive puts and calls so that participants would have to churn through them before gamma could be ramped. By the time it happened, theta would have made your positions not profitable. And Cohen would collect the premium as actors tried to hammer through those put and call walls. He basically does this to kill volalitity.

Plotkin was Cohen's right hand man.

So expect Plotkin will use the 2.75B to drive GME price below 60, then he will ressurect massive put/call walls around a strike price and wait out the ITM 60C options across the calendar. This will kill vol and dampen gamma to prevent a gamma squeeze that can trigger an infinite short squeeze.

**Retails counter move**

Retails only chance is to have a big whale on your side to blast threw those put/call walls that will kill vol; or it's a race against time to trigger the gamma squeeze before Plotkin drives the price below 60 and erects the massive put/call walls that make all the ITM 60C expire worthless and dampens anymore gamma ramping to force a short squeeze.

Retail must drive GME to 115 and soon

Nokia recently renewed their 5-year contract with T-Mobile

## T-Mobile awards Nokia with five-year deal

T-Mobile awarded five-year deals to both Ericsson and Nokia for the continued rollout of its 5G network, but didn‚Äôt specify how much the deals are worth other than to say they‚Äôre ‚Äúmulti-billion-dollar‚Äù agreements.

T-Mobile last year closed its merger with Sprint, which also used Samsung network gear, but it doesn‚Äôt appear that work is carrying over to the newly combined T-Mobile.

‚ÄúT-Mobile already has the largest 5G network in the country,‚Äù said T-Mobile President of Technology Neville Ray in a statement. ‚ÄúThese agreements with our longstanding 5G partners Nokia and Ericsson will help us take our 5G leadership even further, delivering ever-better experiences for our customers for years to come.‚Äù

[According to Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/14/nokia-supports-t-mobile-5g-evolution-with-five-year-expansion-deal/), it will continue to expand T-Mobile‚Äôs Extended Range (low-band) 5G coverage while also supplying macro and small cells across T-Mobile‚Äôs low, mid-band and millimeter wave spectrum, in addition to Massive MIMO in the 2.5 GHz band.

Nokia said the outlook it provided last fall included the expected impact of this deal with T-Mobile, so it doesn‚Äôt change that guidance.

Nokia in particular can use some good news in the network supply arena. Last fall, Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark warned of expected financial challenges in 2021 and indicated plans to invest heavily in 5G. It‚Äôs been widely speculated that Nokia lost a $6.6 billion 5G contract with Verizon last year when the U.S. carrier instead¬†[chose Samsung](https://www.fiercewireless.com/financial/samsung-scores-6b-network-deal-verizon).

They even have more deals and contracts here: [https://www.nokia.com/networks/5g/5g-contracts/](https://www.nokia.com/networks/5g/5g-contracts/)

# Why I think this stock has the potential to run

In 2020 NASA awarded Nokia (NOK) first mobile cellular network on the moon. Stocks pertaining to the Space economy are a new emerging sector right now. You're seeing all these Space ETFS coming into the market. This new emerging space economy is worth around $2 trillion. Now, you probably know what I'm going to say next in case you don't let me tell you!

The new CEO has been recently aiming focus on 5G, 5G will be needed to aid self driving cars etc. But one thing that's bigger than that is being able to connect to the internet any where in the world, perhaps via satellite in space. As a company, this could open a variety of new opportunities for NOK in this emerging $2 trillion space economy.

Steve Cohen/Plotkin's Likely Massive Put/Call Wall Strategy

First, all you diamond hands are hereby promoted to Lt. Colonel after today. All you paper hands should be ashamed with yourself, but you still have time to help your fellow brothers against the Big Bad, Melvin Capital.

**Context**

Melvin Capital was bailed out today\[1\]. They were close to liquidating their position but were rescued. This is supported by the fact that as GME passed the 115 gamma ramp and headed to 150, the rest of the market was going red, likely from Melvin liquidating. This could have caused a cascading effect across other funds an positions, but that's another post. What is evident was that Melvin Capital was likely about to start liquidating but was rescued by Plotnik's Papa Steve Cohen with 2.75B \[1\]

SPY violent drop halted the bullish momentum. Short attack at noon failed to reverse sentiment. Expect more volatility during the week. This is my own interpretation of the price action today and is not financial advice. Honestly, I'm a moron with an IQ below 69. I don't have a PT. I let the market tell me that.

&#x200B;

[1min intraday chart of GME \(candles\) and SPY \(blue line\)](https://preview.redd.it/8osyp4jqdjd61.png?width=2433&format=png&auto=webp&s=49125a85d34b59adcd3376812a22ddd25b5cbbb9)

&#x200B;

Very strong pre-market activity opening with a 2.5M shares sold to force price below 95.  [Read this post to understand why this 95 level matters. Absolutely on point during today's action.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4207e/gme_options_pricing_expected_and_max_volatility/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) MM needed to defend this price level or hedge above it. At this point in time, for 1/29, there were 25.000 puts ITM and +25.000 calls OTM between 95 - 115. Once the 95 level broke, it was a gamma event like last friday only this time, price shoot-up above the highest strike and all the way to $160. Notice the deceleration after 115 (highest strike) which could mean that MM were completing their hedges. After, I believe we started seeing short covering and margin calls. 22M shares traded hands within 20 minutes as price shoots from 115 to 160 and with $10 dollar bid-ask spreads.   


But then, trading halted and SPY took a violent dive bringing down all equities across the board. Algo trading kicked-in and GME lost 50% in less than 30min. However, unlike the previous increase, less than 10M shares traded hands in that period. Notice how OBV reacted with both moves.

The MM gamma event lost momentum and at exactly noon, when liquidity tends to dry, a big short attack to drive price down to the previous open, only to be countered by some big money purchases to where it currently stands (and likely will close).

&#x200B;

My take on all this is that the tape is showing accumulation at current prices. OI in OTM calls and puts is now close to 200.000 contracts (say actually 15M shares - or half the current float to hedge) for 1/29 alone. Gamma events are not over and if today is any indication, it seems like MMs are more active hedging then last week. With a gap-up at open it should be similar price action.
