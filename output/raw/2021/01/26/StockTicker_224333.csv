I think the large players are starting to realize they need to take the retards on reddit seriously. I think they're attempting to astroturf the investing subreddits by giving awards to tickers they have a vested interest in. And at this moment, that's anything that isn't GME. They know that once the prevailing enthusiasm subsides they'll have the opportunity to close.

Stay wary and stay vigilant my comrades. This is a war of attrition.

Your contempt for the retail investor (your audience) is palpable and if you don’t get it together, you’ll lose an entire new generation of investors. 

I keep thinking about these funds that are short GME like your boys at Melvin Capital / your coverage of this subreddit and I’m getting madder and madder. 

These funds can manipulate the market via your network and if they screw up big because they don’t even know the basics of portfolio risk 101 and using position sizing, they just get a bailout from their billionaire friends at Citadel. Then they have the nerve to turn us into public enemy #1 just because we believe in an underdog company getting a second chance. 

We don’t have billionaires to bail us out when we mess up our portfolio risk and a position goes against us. We can’t go on TV and make attempts to manipulate millions to take our side of the trade. If we mess up as bad as they did, we’re wiped out, have to start from scratch and are back to giving handjobs behind the dumpster at Wendy’s.

* As of Jan 22 2021 close, they were [down 30%](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/steve-cohen-ken-griffin-invest-3-billion-gamestop-short-seller-2021-1-1030003305). They had [13.1 bn AUM](https://aum13f.com/firm/melvin-capital-management-lp) as of Mar 2020 (assuming this doesn't change), that's a **loss of $3.9 bn as of Jan 22 2021**.
* During this time, GME increased $46.95 (from $17.9 to $64.85). **AKA for every $11.95 increase in GME price, Melvin loses $1bn.**

GME price as I am writing this is $103.46. That means:

* **Since the $2.75bn bailout, Melvin has lost another $3.2 bn or 25%.**

Keep the pressure coming. We are doing this! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit: **When $GME hits \~$175 it'll be game fucking over for Melvin.** \-100% loss. They can't restart.

This is a big moment. A tug of war between tradition and the future.

Hedge fund managers live in the past, and continue to look down upon the retail investors. They truly believe that we, the average retail investors, don't know anything about finances or the market (which may be true), and we're just gambling our money away.

We don't know any better. WE NEED HEDGE FUND MANAGERS TO TELL US WHAT TO DO! SAVE US!

This is the world they want to live in. This was the past.

Remember that scene from the Sopranos, where Tony's wife calls to buy 5000 shares of Webonics, after she was manipulated emotionally to so?  Institutions and hedge funds want us to be stuck in that world.

They're scared of the future.

They're scared because, so much information is available for free now. THere's no more fees for trading. We have large communities that discuss stocks and trading openly.

We can think and make decisions for ourselves, which scares the FUCK out of old school institutions and hedge funds.

Fuck them all. This affects every single one of you, whether or not you're holding $GME.

TLDR: Fuck hedge funds. This is a crosspoint into the future.

And was asked to post this as a discussion.

The most important thing is actually **until Friday there** will be another **price** battle in which the short sellers will try to keep as many calls as possible outside the price so that they cannot be executed and the broker does not have to buy them on the market to cover them .  
It is particularly critical because **monthly and weekly calls** expire, as far as I know the highest monthly call was **60c 1/29** and **115c 1/29** (left out the new 200c).

The MM will try everything to push the course **below 60** , **our goal to get to 115** . Until then, **expect massive short attacks** , it will probably be even more blatant than yesterday. Since a price limit is harder to keep higher up, don't be surprised if there is a red tag up until then or the lower limit is 60-80.  
For those of you who don't know what is meant, 100xLimit orders at $ 60 are $ 6000 <$ 11500 100x at $ 115 and easier to hold or buy from autistic people.

And almost most importantly **, put your stop loss out** , the **shortsellers try** to trigger as many as possible with their short sales in order to trigger **a chain reaction of panic selling** .

Remember **yesterday we saw exactly that** , price dumping at its finest, although almost no short position was powered.

Should we be **able to hold the $ 115 by Friday** , the banks (! Not the shortsellers) would have to buy an additional 8 million shares to cover the demand for the calls. To achieve this there is really only the possibility 🚀✋🏻💎🤚🏻,

**Don't be a paper bitch!**

All figures relate to estimates and information or assumptions and observations from DD from here and the Angelsachen forum. Due to the high trading volume, it is not possible to say how the share is currently distributed !!

**This is not a financial advice, but an autistic one.** **Always invest wisely and make your own decisions.**

And now relax America won't open for another 4 hours anyway.

Not only did they not account for the tsunami of smooth-brains YOLOing FD's, (spearheaded by big dick big brain ape kings like DFV) they're going bankrupt for it.

From this day forth, every hedgefund (especially ones that short) will have to account for the Retard Factor ™. There will always be the risk of the Robinhood Autists taking their Little Johns to tendietown!

I for one can't wait to see it in retard Jr's finance textbook in the future.

Here's the short of it:

\-  15 U.S.C. § 78 is the relevant US code that governs market  manipulation.  It's got a few rules.  Publicly traded companies have to  regularly make disclosures (so not WSB).   And it regulates exchanges,  dealers, brokers, insiders, and employees of publicly traded companies  (only you can decide if you're one of these.  Personally, this raised an  interesting question for me because I'm in venture capital (that,  thankfully, it looks like I'm OK on), but YMMV.  Maybe you work for a  meme company and have gone full retard.  You're on your own.

***Obviously, ""market manipulation"" is what everybody here is shaking their titties over.  The rules here are pretty simple.***

\-You  can't ""create false demand"" or overtly distort prices.  Remember, this  law was written in the 1930's, so being able to lie about something's  price was easier back then.  Not really applicable today.  Nobody here  is creating ""false"" demand.  In the case of short squeezes, it's  creating ""actual"" demand.

\-Can't  talk about insider information - yet to see that here, so all good.   Even if I did see it, I wouldn't trust half of you to properly interpret  what you read unless it was full of rocket ships or eggplants.

\-Can't  spread false information about a company.  While I would argue there's  actually a lot of that here, it's not with intent, it's out of ignorance  99 out of 100 times.  Further, the SEC hasn't effectively enforced this  rule in decades.  There are hedge fund managers who openly admit to  breaking this law.   Plus, the original intent with this law was  (apparently, according to lawyer) meant more for companies to not pull  an Enron.  It is, in other words, in effect toothless.

\-The  interesting one is with regards to group trading.  So there's a whole  set of rules that comes into play when an organized group of traders own  more than 5% of a company's stock.  I'll spare all the boring middle  details here because the conclusion is nobody KNOWS how much of a  certain company's stock this sub collectively owns.  I would posit a  very strong theory that we own quite a bit more than 5% of Gamestop,  BUT....there's never been a straw poll to prove it and nobody here has  any real way of knowing if that's the case.  Even if somebody did, they  would have to effectively communicate it to everybody else in the sub to  alert them of potential conflicts/problems, because ""intent"" is a  qualifier for this particular rule.  There's no fucking way this island  of misfit toys is going to be effectively communicated that status.   Even if that information did become widely known, it would be impossible  to prove that rocket emojis, calling people paper handed bitches for  exiting a position, or telling people to let their wives' boyfriends  take care of the women while you're off earning your tendies qualifies  as illegal coordinated manipulation.  Especially given how many bots and  shills Melvin has deployed here lately trying to discourage or scare  people into selling their positions.

Which  means what everybody largely suspected, anyways:  All the people on TV  are blowing hot air to try and scare people at the behest of their hedge  fund manager bosses and to create a story that fits a pre-defined  narrative.  The SEC doesn't give two shits about you and isn't spying on  you (but that plumbing van that's been outside your house might be a  problem - your wife's boyfriend might have gotten a boyfriend), and you  can take off the tin foil.  Unless you're long REYN, in which case  you're probably helping your Boomer stock oh-so-slightly, Randy.

TL:DR:  Securities Fraud requires fraud, which requires intent, so

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  = fine

💎🤲 = fine

🌈🐻  = not just fine but necessary

🦍🤲💪  = just good strong community bonding

Keeping holding and relax.**

With a lot of chatter going around and some excellent DD being shared with lots of technical analysis there still seems to be doubt as to 1) If the squeeze is happening, and 2) How to capitalize on it.  Please spend a few minutes reading this so you're more informed as a trader (even if this is your first time being a trader).  This is not a technical analysis but more a plain English guide:

1. **Crazy price volatility:** I think this one is self-explanatory but if you're wondering what price volatility looks like go check out a Google chart from the past week or so.  A stock moving up 20%+ day after day after day is not typical.
2. **Those who stand to lose the most go on the offensive:** At this point it is fairly well established that WSB has many user accounts being used for a variety of purposes, but at the moment many of those accounts are trying to drum up emotional responses to counter the short squeeze.  People hyping new tickers with far less short-term upside, saying that the facts are not true (remember kids: you're entitled to opinions but not your own facts).
3. **Those who stand to lose are taking MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR life lines:** Again, this so self-explanatory but yet still not all of us believe that a squeeze is happening.  During the 2008/2009 crash there were MAJOR US BANKS that were getting $2-5BN in bailout money to prevent the entire economy from collapsing.  Yesterday a relatively small hedge fund posing ZERO systemic risk took a $2.75BN bailout that without it would have likely seen them disappear from the system with ZERO impact to our greater economy as a whole.
4. **Confusion:** Have you noticed that some of the ""smartest guys in the room"" can't seem to agree on television and in the media as to what is going on??  If you actually believe that there is some debate going on amongst the experienced and elite Wall Street types then there may be no hope for you in life.  Con artists prey on the gullible and you will be a slaughtered sheep soon.
5. **Just f-ing hold if you like money!!:** If the above four bullet points haven't convinced you then nothing will so just sit back, relax, and let the men do our work.  If your wrists get weak and your paper hands get so feeble that you sell at these low prices then we (the real men of this sub) are better off without you owning the stock anyway.  AND STOP BUYING OPTIONS YOU STUPID IDIOTS! Calls were great to have bought in 2019, even into mid-to-late 2020, but the price you're paying for them now is a rip-off.  AND, the volatility on the price means your chances of losing money have never been better!

Warren Buffett has famously said at multiple shareholder meetings that he doesn't want people owning Berkshire stock if they're the type of *investor* that trades in and out of positions.  He wants long-holders, people that believe in the mission of the company, believe in the management, and want to get wealthy, NOT RICH.

**You might be in the middle of something that will not happen to you again EVER in your investing life, or perhaps only a handful of times from now until you retire.  Don't screw it up by thinking that jumping off the fastest moving train, and one that is unique and a statistical anomaly, is going to happen again on some other ticker that has gotten the unfortunate meme status that the elite are trying to trick you into right now.**

NOK, BB, and others may all go up in the future and if you want to invest in them then you should wait.  How long??  Who knows.  And who cares?!?!?  You're probably in your 20's or even teens, you have plenty of time to invest in many good companies in your lifetime but quite likely NONE will go through this kind of movement over a period of a few weeks and if you sell now (you paper handed p-ssy) you will never forgive yourself.  HOLD, be patient, let the shorts bleed themselves to death, and in the meantime go focus on something other than Reddit!

Good luck to all.

***EDIT: I somehow forgot to add positions.  In keeping with the suggestion of others not to broadcast exact holdings (don't show the enemies your positions!) I will just say I have a high six-figure position of SHARES ONLY and I haven't even thought about selling for a moment.  This is not my biggest holding and my life won't be changed whether it eventually settles at $50/share or $500/share and YOURS WON'T EITHER SO BE STRONG.***

***EDIT II: Stop calling it a ""Loss"" if you bought at $X and it is now below $X.  An actual loss has not occurred until AFTER you sell, and if you don't sell then you won't lose.  It is not more complicated than that.  Seasoned investors (which are on the other side of every trade that you do) rely on you being emotional because they are using a computer with no emotion at all.  Don't be the sucker and don't actually lose money when instead you could actually have a gain!***"|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224324.csv|StockTicker

NOK sells for less than 5$, the cheap price appeals to retailers (retards) in the same way PLTR and GME's less than 30$ a share did for those who cant afford TSLA. I mean you can buy 100 stocks of NOK for less than 500$. think about that. the perfect distraction.

1:  NOK is an NEM. do you know who else is an NEM, Huawei, Ericsson, ZTE. hell even Samsung has aggressivly entered the market a couple of years ago and are strongly positioning themselves especially after Trump banned ZTE and Huawei.
these NEMs are called HENZ (Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia, ZTE) then changed to HENS as samsung grabbed ZTE by their banned balls. all these guys have been involved heavily in 5G. I know that from my 5G centric company.
EDIT: by centric I mean F500 at the heart of the 5G ecosystem.

2: most of the first world is almost done with 5G. yes infrastructure wise done. Im not talking about Zimbabwe (even though Huawei is clear winner in africa btw). 
btw for U.S smooth brains who cant think about the rest of the world, Verizon invested a lot in their 5G infrastructure and towers already, the best in NOT yet to come, it has already been done. AT&T are 90% done, they did a gay way in which all they need is a software update to switch to 5G from LTE. yes there is still a lot of money to be made in 5G market, but thats for full layer solutions, including application layer. I kid you not but people especially in the wireless infrastructure are looking at 6G now... *cough* samsung *cough*

3: NOK is a good company for INVESTING LONG TERM.  they have been early adapters for 5G in their strategy initiative and their execution plan. but that was just the necessarily of growth and survival. lol.of course they got in 5G! what else would they have done. it is the same way how they are going to get in 6G as well and 7G later... you smooth brains saying ""WoW 5G!"" is like looking at a house flipper guy by profession, who buys houses then flips them and sells them, and you retard say, this guy must be on the moon cause he keeps buying houses! well no shit idiots its what they do.

listen, I like NOK, great guys. but dont be fucking retards falling for the bots and implants by MM and melvin capital. NOK isnt going to moon. they are going to steadily grow so take that shit back to r/investing.

tldr; nothing special about NOK other than the cheap price tag ideal by MM to distract paper hands, HOLD your GME and squeeze."|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224324.csv|StockTicker

My economic teacher, yes I’m a 17 year old degenerate, and I have been arguing all year about tesla, and now GME. He’s been teaching our class about bubbles (GME is a bubble it just hasn’t popped yet, there’s still profits to be made) in the market and is always talking down to me like I’ve got no knowledge in the stock market. He kept saying GME had no chance to pass $60 today because of hedge funds and such. I can’t bringing up that a short squeeze was possible. 

Today we argued abt GME. I told him it was going to the moon, talked about the short sellers, shitron and such. He called WSB a bunch of idiot millennials who will go broke, said the same thing about tesla. Today I had the honor of telling him to check GME when the ticker was at +79%. He stared at me pissed off and I said “how are your puts now e-trader”.

Ik the dudes a ton smarter then me on economics I just thought it was funny 

Boys we took a dub today. All of that gets left behind us if we sell. Don’t let them win.

# Fellow tards and mod-tards. This is the most boring post you will never read.

We are now entering a potentially dangerous phase for WSB. I won't repeat or cover all the various reasons why people are looking at this sub, nor what they are saying. 

The goal must be to ensure we don't tank this sub, and tank our tendies.

Its pretty simple: people who are used to making the rules and making money of the ignorance of others are on the wrong side of the trade, and they don't like it, and they won't take it laying down. 

👩🏻‍🚀👩🏻‍🚀👩🏻‍🚀👩🏻‍🚀👩🏻‍🚀👩🏻‍🚀👩🏻‍🚀👩🏻‍🚀👩🏻‍🚀👩🏻‍🚀👩🏻‍🚀👩🏻‍🚀👩🏻‍🚀👩🏻‍🚀👩🏻‍🚀👩🏻‍🚀👩🏻‍🚀

They have extremely deep pockets and can throw insane amounts of money lobbying, getting talking heads on tv or lawyering up, if they haven't already. The narrative is pretty clear: WSB is acting like a mob; they are distorting the market; this isn't allowed. 

We are playing into their hands somewhat. We are helping fuel their arguments. If you don't want to lose this sub, here's what you can do

🌕🌝🌔🌓🌛🌒🌗🌘🌑🌖🌙

**1. Don't do dumb shit that will allow people to make legitimate complaints. Simple examples:** 

a. Doxxing or harrassing people e.g. Citron or Melvin Capital.

b. Trying to get people to buy particular shares of one stock in a concerted effort e.g. ""Lets all buy 10-100 shares of GME at 1000 EST.""

c. Publicly representing that we are in any way an organised, singular entity. 

**2. Don't give Reddit a reason to shut this down.** 

a. Chances of the SEC investigating WSB based on complaints are reasonably high; actually taking action though, the chance is v small in my view. For one, it would be hard to show intent and prove who was doing what to the price. Regulators only like to take on slam dunk cases - they dont have enough resources or political capital to waste on potentially losing hands. The exception is if there is a big public interest in doing so...this is another reason to observe point 1 above. This is not to say they won't give Reddit a call to say ""we think you need to sort out A,B,C” but this is v different from an enforcement action.

b. **Focusing on what the SEC might do misses the point. The threshold for a company disowning a small part of itself, to protect the whole, is very small. Reddit has 330M users. WSB has 2M. You do the math.**

Never mind trying to work out how much revenue Reddit makes from people who produce our quality of meme.

c. Any company who is aware that part of its users are breaking the law, or potentially breaking the law, will not hesitate to cut off the gangrene thumb. No one is going to go in for bat for us for some ideals or whatever. They are worried about bringing attention to the company as a whole, getting regulated, or civil or criminal exposure - as they should be - this is just normal and good governance. 

💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎

**3. Follow the rules for the sub. There are four elements here.**

a. Mods needs to tighten the rules to make it clear which conduct is not acceptable. I recommend including a small banner on each thread that states something like ""WSB does not tolerate any market manipulation or other breaches of law and those who do so will be instantly permabanned."" This can be hyperlink link to the rules or even SEC website.

b. But then - and this is important - the rules **must** be enforced. Whenever you have a compliance program in place, a regulator wants to see the compliance program was reasonable to achieve its required outcome e.g. Not breaking the law and that **it was enforced in fact**. If you have rules that are not enforced its almost worse than having no rules.

c. For us users, **don't break the rules**. Simples. 

d. And if you see other users breaking the rules, report it. Sounds like some Gestapo shit but at the end of the day, you either like this sub and want to protect it or you are going to miss the Tendieman. We have to collectively weed out shittiness and the mods are not going to be able to do this on their own - they are simply to retarded ;-) 

**4. Think about a serious plan B platform if this does get shut down.** 

Can't be Reddit - if the powers that be decide we are done, just calling it saulbeatwets or mallmeatnets won't fool them for long.

**5. Think about putting some tendie money aside to kick in for the mother of all lawsuits.** 

If this does go south, we should consider kickstarting a fund to hire the same type of white shoe law firms these dudes hire and get our guys to point out every known act of manipulation and let the SEC decide who the real problem is. This is how you really fight back and win. 

**6. While I have your attention - can we please try not to take out fellow retards here.** 

Its a big bad world and I can watch my own six and yep everyone needs to learn the hard way. But I don't think we should be out here bitching about Melvin etc while we are trying to shaft each other. If you see this shit, call it out and we'll gather our pitchforks. 

In return, **newbies please f$#@ing read some shit on here before you ask the same question ad nauseum** (the answer is the same anyway: ""No, its defo not too late to FOMO everything you or your tribe owns into an extremely volatile YOLO play and there is no way this can go tits up.”

 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**TL:DR: They are coming for this sub. Don't make it easy for them; follow the rules and mods enforce them.**

I am more than confident to say that a series of Whales have come to battle alongside with us retail shareholders. The Amount of volume and the amount of capital that was thrown at this stock today was nothing short of remarkable. The battle started at 11:01am EST, when the first short attack began, and the stock was able to find the floor at about $97.02. What followed was absolutely mind blowing.

For the next nearly two hours there was a series of extremely systematic buying. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that the whales have come to our aid. If you look at the chart below you will see that every 45 minutes there is a short attack of some sort and that attack is was denied every single time. Now I am not doubting at all in the strenght of out community, but the only folks out there with this much capital are other insitututions that want in on this historical event.

https://preview.redd.it/g60mjf6yjqd61.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbec1601b7ee211993b5a0635f5ec54e8230dfb4

That's right I beleive at this time the Rohirrim has arrived lead by a mass of insitutional investors that want a slice of that 2.75 Billion dollar bail out. And they are willing to shell out at premium prices to bleed Melvin Capital Dry. There is still 30 minutes left in this session, lets just see how this plays out.

This is just an observation with rough hypothesis based on today's oberserved trading activity and is not advice.

EDIT: Just a Quick Update

[The BALLS on the trade desks of these firms. They all must have custom Hagar Pants being made in a spare office on the daily.](https://preview.redd.it/3ekdo813rqd61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcc42e0badc92f6e84af4435805fdc7eebc1bea3)

Looks like according to Level two trading, there is a significant ""Sell Wall"" at $150 for about 54k shares. So there is going to need to be some significant volume to push through that level, which is completely possible at the open.

I was in high school, autistic, and poor. I saw the gains and knew this was the way. I became an economics major to enhance my autism but was surprised to learn how little any of the shit I learned translated into the market. I asked my professors what they thought about wsb and they basically laughed us off as a bunch of idiots. 

When I saw the GME revolution I took what little college money I had and bought 100 shares of GME. This is our chance to stick it to those who never took us seriously. Either we forge economic history or loose it all, I’m willing to take this risk. Fuck the hedge funds and fuck anyone supporting them. Over the week I learned more then I’ve learned from any of my classes in college.

TLDR; Mass BB call option buying has forced the big boys to short this like crazy. 🚀🚀🚀

I wanted to point out that whats happening this week in BlackBerry is actually quite amazing. Yesterday, you beautiful retards bought and opened tens of thousands of option contracts that expire this Friday at $25 in BB. There was also a mass buying of the $20 contracts. What we are seeing today and saw some yesterday is big boys are coming in and shorting this stock like crazy. These guys sold thousands of contracts to us for this Friday and they HAVE to keep the BB price under $25 or this is GME all over again.

This is actually the type of setup a large hedge fund might see and say hey if we can push BB over 25 by Friday it will cause so much frenetic buying that the stock might hit 40. 

Likely nothing will come of this, but if you are wondering why your favorite meme play is down today despite good news (BAIDU partnership) and LOTS of new money coming in on the buy side this is why.

Us, the EUROPOORS, are setting this up once again today. In a couple of hours the Euronext will open up and we'll bend Melvin over for you fuckers to blast them!

Make sure you follow and go balls deep, and remember: WE OWN A SHIT TON OF SHARES. Unless GME issues new ones, they can't buy shit unless we sell them. If we don't let our brokers lend them, we are screwing them even more.

Let's get this refueled and blast it to Andromeda! We'll meet in Tahiti and talk this moment while we sniff cocaine off our wives while their paper-hands boyfriends sit home and cry!!!

**I CHOSE THESE DD'S BECAUSE THEY ARE CONCISE AND CLEAR AND HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION BULLET POINTED FOR AUTISTS BUT THERE IS MUCH MORE.**

The long and short of $NOK is they are a wildly undervalued stock in a particularly nifty low IV position primed to take off like wildfire. From eating Huawei's lunch to building cell towers on the moon for NASA to GLOBAL 5G to RAN architecture to a new CEO.. THE LIST GOES ON. 

**ANOTHER TL;DR** - WITH THE GOVT CONTRACTS, COMPANY RESTRUCTURING, 5G INFRASTRUCTURE PLAYS, GLOBAL MKT CAP OPPORTUNITIES $NOK IS EASILY $8-10 PER SHARE IN A COUPLE WEEKS/MONTHS AND THAT IS BEING EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE.

I am risking making a GME post after being banned for 3 days for making a GME post! Idk if the following will get me banned but here it goes...

Too many accounts with less than 10 post karma asking to set a sell limit at $1000! These are Melvin shill bots who know they can cover at $1000 from that juicy 2.5 billion loan that Citadel gave! Which means they see this sht flying to the magnitude of $30,000 or more! 

Do not fall for that lame $1000 price! GME is increasing 100% everyday and $1000 will be in 2 trading days! This is nothing! They are scared of those 30k price target! I’m setting sell my limit to 30k+ so when Melvin fks get margin called this Friday, they have to pay what ever the fk I’m selling for! 

And ban those accounts that are shilling the $1000 limit sell comments! They are everywhere! 

To the moooooon we gooooo!!! 🚀🚀🚀

TLDR: 1000 is nothing. I’m putting my sell limit to $69,420

Edit: a lot of comment regarding how Melvin will be liquidated at $175. I don’t give a flying fuk about Melvin. I just used their names as they are the most popular GME short. I want all the fkers to go bankrupt. Shitron and what not. All 139% current shorts to cover. 
Let the greatest wealth transfer begin!

Edit 2: why have that jacked up high 69420 sell limit??? I thought it was obvious but seems it’s not so as a fellow user _Hamilton_ explains in the comments:

“This is legit. The whole point of the sell limit is to prevent your broker from lending out your shares to the likes of Melvin. $69,420 is much better than the $5000 I previously advocated.

Keep buying more shares from people who lend out their shares for shorting, and deny them to borrow your shares for their short scam scheme.

This means they have to cover as their current borrowed shares is no longer available. Just set it so high that they can't afford to buy'em. GME is tits up to the moon. Melvin Shitron will both go bankrupt as we write history. Oh, and they where bankrupted by a bunch of internet retards, this is their worst nightmare”."|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224324.csv|StockTicker

Get your letters/emails ready to send. Hopefully some smarter retard than me can write up a format, but we will have to fight for this free market after a hedge fund bleeds so publicly. 

Remember it’s not “just” the hedge funds. It’s their rich as fuck clients that expect to never have to worry about money. They are gonna be pissed that their accounts took a hit, and hedge funds will blame us. 

People with money tend to back other people with money. This fight will bleed out into the public. And we are gonna need >2Million retards reeeeeeeeing as loudly as possible to ensure that the rules don’t change. They already made PDT rules, and accredited investor requirements.

Not even a mod.

Melvin and all his 🌈 🐻 friends were tilling away to take away the tendies of WSB, blinded by their arrogance and greed that has gotten them so far.

Cramer the once exiled boomer has become a semi-respected boomer for sticking up for retail investors,  but MSM has sided with the MMs for so long, the retards cannot fully trust him.

It is AH and GME is sitting at $89, up 310% in the past week. Your wife has just returned home from the Wendy's you work at with her BF. Not to be forgotten he got you a frosty, your favorite flavor. You eat away merrily as he rails her in the next room, staring at Robinhood and WSB for updates dreaming of tendies. Falling asleep with tendies on your mind with honey mustard dipping sauce.

Boomers and manipulators have been trying to dissuade you and your fellow tards for weeks that GME is a dying business. But Papa RC has come down and spread his loving arms showing a path to greatness. There has been volatility and GUH along the way for those who bought at the top. But they know what is to come. 

The SEC has just finished its preliminary report, and WSB has been deemed a coalition of degenerate gamblers and fetishists of pee drinking cuckholds. Completely innocent of wrongdoing.

The following morning, its 430AM, you open up your trading app, GME is at $690.42 (nice). You roll over on your dog bed to tell Chad and your wife the good news. Market opens: Melvin and Shitron have fled the country and GME is trading at $4206.90. 

You stare at your one share and think.... I made a difference, sell. And go back to sleepies.

May PAPA RC bless us, every one.

# GameStop History Lesson:

**tldr**: GME bumbles about like a senile boomer and dabbles in terrible bets. Turns into undervalued stock with cultural significance, gets picked up by Big Dick Burry and Ryan Chewy Cohen.

GME is a childhood dream that turns any grown man into an autist as soon as he walks into the door. Now due to our Lady Rona (covid), a bunch of past Boomer business decisions ([GME fucking bough 507 AT&T stores](https://news.gamestop.com/node/10001) in 2014, not pivoting into omni-channel, [largely misssing the gaming industry explosion](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf), and [a CEO](https://news.gamestop.com/leaders/george-sherman) who prides himself on brick and morter Advance auto parts, Best Buy, Target, Home depot) GME by and large was shitting the bed as investors thought of this company as neglected mallfront with dwindling clientele.

&#x200B;

**In comes Michael big dick Burry**

With the stock trading at $3.78/share in August 2019 investers were sure it was finished. But here's where it gets interesting. With big dick energy seemingly out of no where Michael Burry *(yes that dude in the Big Short who seems like a fellow autist)* buys 2,750,000 shares or 3.05% of GameStock. In his actual [letter to the board](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190819005633/en/) *(yes I dug it up so you can read it as well)* he describes the thought process for the purchase bullets below.

* GameStop was trading at an all-time low ($3.78/share) and he believed that it had not leveraged it's ""elite potision in the gaming universe"" over the last 5 years *(keep in mind, it's fucking GameStop a cultural icon large enough to make a grown man weep with fond memories*
* Shareholders do not have faith in current managament and have not been inspired by new leadership policies
* At time of writing stocks were more than 60% shorted

&#x200B;

*(Taking a break to say, it's not too late the* ***squeeze has not been squoze*** *oblig 💎🙌 = 🚀🚀)*

&#x200B;

**Ryan mega dick Cohen writes a letter**

Then in Nov 16th 2020, Ryan Cohen comes in swinging and tears a new one to the board members of GameStop. For people who don't know who Ryan Cohen is, he stuck the finger to Amazon and [built a digital e-commerce site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewy_(company)) (wiki link) for fucking dogs and cats into a $3.35 billion entity by 2017. Keep in mind that he submitted a Schedule 13D to purchase 121,644 shares at $6.56 per and 163,030 at $8.63 - that's a 10% stake [(yes, I've also dug the original Schedule 13d using google)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000699/rc13da2-091820.htm). Now Ryan's letter reads like a solid talking down that might rival the Queen - looking at you [r/TheCrownNetflix](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrownNetflix/), [r/AskUK](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/).

[I've included Ryan's letter to the board](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf) but will bullet point paraphrase below for you folks still on Yahoo or Ask Jeeves.

* GME has a strong brand across the globe and has 55 million PowerUp members
* GME needs to pivot immediately to a tech structure and it can *(lolz, after this letter they immediately brought Ryan and Chewy co onto board)*
* Size of the global gaming market has grown more than **2.5x** since the last console cycle

&#x200B;

**Ryan mega dick Cohen and team join GameStop board**

In January 2021 [Ryan Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen), [Alan Attal](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/alan-attal), and [Jim Grube](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jim-grube) join GME's board. Now for those of you in the bread line or living at your wife's mothers house playing [r/DnD](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/) with her boyfriend, board changes are big news. These board members have the power to make multiple grown men cry, fire CEOs like it's nothing and change a companies strategy sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.

With Papa Cohen coming onboard and his squad of Chewy troopers, it's likely that we are going to soon see a pimped out GameStop that will make you name your first born ""GME"". Now I'll let you do your own digging and reading but here's just some of the GME DD on it's future potential [(link to DD on some of GME's possible pivots](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/), [One DD to rule them all](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/))

# The squeeze has NOT been squoze:

There is still time for you to convince your wife's girlfriend to lend you money to buy GME. The squeeze has not been squoze and likely wont until we see the type of eruption that accompanied [r/belledelphineXmas](https://www.reddit.com/r/belledelphineXmas/) leaks (yes that sub is NSFW).

Side note on the Squeeze, GME is still massively over shorted at estimates from 130-300% and counting. The important thing to know is that these greedy bastards took multiple short positions on a single stock (naked) and essentially bet that GME was going to go down.

[https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today) (249.67% Shorted)

&#x200B;

**But what happened on Thursday/Friday?**

Gamma squeeze. Short and simple. Now you can read some other DD about what a gamma squeeze so I wont dive into it too much.

It was not the squeeze. Market makers needed to rush to fill calls that were In The Money. This prompted these market makers to buy up stock in the off chance that they needed to actually sell them to degens who were actually betting that GME would blow it's sweet load at 60 and now at 150 lolz. This pared with the low stock volume on the market makes for high volitility on a per stock basis. Here's some [DD links talking about what a Gamma squeeze what we witnessed was that.](https://nope-its-lily.medium.com/gamestop-power-to-the-market-players-part-2-6ef00eff1d26)

**Ok MallCop2020, but when will it Squeeze?** *(when it does squeeze it may squeeze multiple times)*

Thanks to fellow autist [u/tsukune\_surprise](https://www.reddit.com/u/tsukune_surprise/) *(and no, CNBC I don't even know this person - they could be a robot or even a fucking dog with a cybor implant IDK!)* BUT I love their DD for the MOASS [(Mother of All Short Squeeze)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4bnfr/moatadd_for_the_moass_there_will_be_more_than_one/). Short answer is that it could be this week, could be next but it's hard to say when the big banks are using dirty tricks like naked call ladders, actual bail outs lolz. (*Fresh DD from another internet stranger on* [*GME EndGame Part 3)*](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l528pz/gme_endgame_part_3_a_new_opponent_enters_the_ring/)

**Okay, I've asked my wife's girlfriend nicely and now have $1k...**

Buy fucking shares. No legit, support your random internet brethren *(who don't know each other)* and buy shares of GameStop. Every share you buy bleeds money from Citron and Melvin.

Here's an explanation from [u/robert1032010](https://www.reddit.com/u/robert1032010/) a Hedge Fund Manager on the current short position within GME: [(A hedge fund managers perspective on GME)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/)

>The short positions of this issue appears (although I can't be certain) to exceed 100% with all available shares already lent out from marginal accounts and probably a lot of naked shorting going on as well. Although I don't yet have the current data on todays short position, I can say for certain the stock remains very heavily shorter, perhaps more so now than at any previous time. Today, I called my broker asking about the availability of shares to short and the borrow costs. We have one of the larger accounts at our brokers firm and I was able to speak directly to the ""hard to borrow"" desk. No borrowable shares are available at any broker, anywhere, at this time, even for high borrow costs or even from other brokers. This extreme short against a small common float, made more extreme no-doubt by naked shorting, could end very poorly for those short this issue. As they are forced to close out their positions, the stock will continue to rise and continue to exacerbate the positive effects the rising price has on the above 4 issues.

&#x200B;

Lastly, this is not financial advice; do your own DD. I'm holding $20k at $100/share and yes, I still fucking believe that the tendieman will come and rain tendies.

We all remember when he complained that shorting should be illegal, and when he released “short shorts” when he finally defeated them. 

But guess who used to brag about shorting Tesla? Gabe 🌈🐻 Plotkin. 

From [Bloomberg:](https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2019-07-19/cohen-cub-gabriel-plotkin-sees-fund-surge-about-44-this-year)

Plotkin described Melvin as “a very human-intensive place. We have a lot of analysts, we require a lot out of them.” The team has modeled more than 500 companies in “significant detail,” while a data science group reads into trends.
He added that the firm has an “intense focus” on the short side, with about 70% of profits in Melvin’s first year coming from bearish bets. Plotkin expressed skepticism about mall real estate investment trusts, as well as electric-car maker Tesla Inc.

$GME to the 🌚, then profits back to a safe store of value: $TSLA.

UPDATE: [better source](https://fintel.io/so/us/tsla/melvin-capital-management-lp) showing Melvin Capital’s puts on TSLA from 2016 through 2020

On top of this they have have lost 30% and January isn't even finished yet. The key here is that now everyone knows the precarious situation Melvin got themselves in. Now think a second about the type of clients that would have their wealth stashed away at Melvin Capital. These are people with so much money that they've never even thought once about what it would be like to work at a Wendy's.  They aren't trying to YOLO their last scrap of savings into weeklies, they're expecting good returns every year and they think they're rich enough that risk doesn't apply to them.

Now they see all over the news that their hedge fund is in SERIOUS trouble.  They see that they almost got margin called on a position with UNLIMITED loss potential.  The first one who realizes this will also realize that their only chance of not losing it all is to be the first one to leave Melvin.  Once that happens the dominos start to fall.

**April 2020** \- Long story short, I started in April 2020 right after COVID, whereby I got introduced to some 'gurus'/paid courses to learn basic options strategies. Bought calls on everything tech, FB, AMD, SE, NVDA, PTON, FSLY, etc, etc. Started to find that ""money was so easy to make"" and even took out bank loans.

**August 2020** \- Indices rally all day everyday, stonks only go up, earnings always beat and stonks rally, made $175k in only 3/4 months.

**September 2020** \- Crashed hard for 3 days, and due to poor risk management with absolutely ZERO take profit / stop losses, watched ALL my tech calls bleed into oblivion. Profit got wiped out and I was literally back at breakeven. Wasted 4/5 months of my time, had no job, and was in debt. Went into semi-depression.

**October 2020** \- Figured I had to find get my money back, all I needed was just ONE good play to go all-in, and I would recover. Or at least that's what I told myself. Found this guy NoProblemChanging who seemed to be really accurate at predicting the markets - literally followed the advice of a stranger on WSB and went all in on puts due to his bearish views and certainty that the market was going to crash.

**November 2020** \- As we all know, everyone was expecting elections to be a shitshow but vaccine news rallied the markets with multiple gap ups and stuff. **By now I was already down $100k and was depressed. Imagine having made easy money ($175k in 4 months) in the greatest bull market of all time, only to lose it all in 3 days and even going negative, while seeing every stonk around me go up everyday while my puts bled all day. Not going to lie, at this moment I felt like $ROPEing although logically I know $100k is money that can still be earned back.**

I was so desperate at this moment that I HAD to find something that I could ALL IN and GUARANTEED to make money. Then, I found $GME. I found u/DeepFuckingValue and that's when I climbed into the rabbit hole, knowing it was a fundamentally undervalued company. Bought around $15\~. Huge credit to GMEShortSqueeze and u/Uberkikz11 as well.

**December 2020** \- By this time, I was pretty much already all in $GME but I hedged with CCs / sold some of my calls WAY TOO EARLY. **To put it into perspective, if I didn't touch my positions at all until today, I would have been around $3m, but as of now I'm only around $1.4m. Regardless, I am grateful!**

**January 2021** \- I've joined the 2 comma club officially! Finally hit my milestone.

**TLDR; made easy money on the rally after COVID in 4 months, lost it all in 3 days due to poor risk management and even went negative, briefly experienced depression and felt like $ROPEing, found a good company $GME, went all in with conviction, emerged stronger than ever.  💎🙌  🚀 🚀 🚀  🚀 🚀 🚀  If I can do it, so can you.**

""Man,"" you think to yourself, ""Cohen City sure is beautiful this time of year."" Your blissful trance is interrupted by the whirring of your hover-Tesla landing itself by the pool. ""Good morning sir,"" chimes T3SS, the soft-spoken AI, ""your Neuralink has indicated your are in need of service."" You step into the back of the vehicle, taking a moment to run your hand across the soft, bear-leather interior. ""Take me to the nearest GameTower,"" you say with a smile, ""my girlfriend's husband has been a good boy lately, I thought I might pick him up a Switch 5 as a treat.""

Gliding through the remnants of Old Manhattan you can't help having a twisted sense of delight seeing the old hedge fund offices now in ruin. ""Serves them right,"" you sigh, shaking your head. As you descend to the ground entrance of MegaGameTower #8A, you hear an abrupt warning chime. ""Gay Bear detected at landing site,"" urges T3SS, ""Shall I commence eradication procedures?"" You look below to see the familiar sight of a desperate, tattered boomer on the sidewalk. Just before you can say yes, you notice a look in his eyes. You recognize this one, you've seen his face before. ""Actually T3SS, don't worry about procedures, drop me down next to him, I wanna talk.""

You step out of the vehicle and approach the man. You can tell he's clearly disturbed, rocking back and forth muttering ""tw-tw-TWenTY, tw- TWenTy"" to himself. He locks eyes with you, ""oh SIR, PLEASE sir, one short is all I need! can you PLEASE spare some credits for a poor analyst like me?"", he begs. ""Actually Andrew,"" you prod, his eyes widening from the shock oh hearing his name, "" I have a better idea. Let's take you inside, I'll buy you anything you want, I'll even throw in a year's worth of PowerUpPrime+ membership so we can't get you into an apartment, how's that sound?""He tears up, ""y-you mean you're not gonna hack me, or sign me up for Grindr?"" ""No,"" you assure him, ""I think you've had enough, I think it's time someone showed you that GameAzonCorp isn't the dying retailer you think it is."" ""b-but the NUMBERS?"" he stammers. You cut him off, ""Oh just look around you, you stupid lemon! They own this whole CITY, and the board is in talks of acquiring the Canadian Federation, do THOSE numbers add up?"" Andrew looks defeated, ""I-I guess you're right. I guess this whole time I was just hoping that one day, ONE day I'd be right about something. It's about time I start listening to market geniuses like you."" You smile, ""See, that wasn't so hard was it, come on buddy  let's go.""

Later that night, as you're tucking in your girlfriend's husband, he turns to you ""You really are the best cuckolder I could've ever asked for! Tell me again the story about how you defeated all the big mean boomers and became a trillionaire!"" You chuckle ""Haha, sure thing little buddy."" The story is a short one.

""The year was 2021. The retard army and I were holding the line as the evil bears were advancing, paper hands were dropping around us left and right, we weren't sure we could stay retarded much longer. But then, General DFV led us forward. We pulled together, diamond hands at full capacity, never selling, never using margin, until finally, FINALLY, the hedge funds relented. 'ENOUGH,' they cried, their clients' portfolios deep in the red, 'We surrender! Please, PLEASE let us buy your shares, we can't take it anymore!' And, well, the rest is history..."" you drift off seeing that he's asleep.

As you lay in bed you can't stop smiling thinking about that story. ""I've made it,"" you think to yourself, ""It was all worth it.""

I've tried to help everyone as much as possible but it just wasn't enough. My own business died during the lockdown as well but I was able to save up some cash.

Most of it is now I'm GME. I've bought shares for 20k at 120 average. If this rocket will fly over $1000 I'll be able to help these families get back on their feet (and the kids will be able to go back to dancing classes!).

I have been watching GME with almost every waking hour I have. It is safe to say that I was initially excited, but then worried about Melvin's bailout by Citadel and Point 27. Citadel are absolutely vast, and basically *are* the market, and have deeper pockets than anyone in the game thus far. I feared the squeeze may have been squashed. 



But then, **rejoice**



The eyes of the world are upon GME. This morning, my father who works for some boomer pension fund called me to excitedly tell me that GME was brought up in a meeting he had this morning. This is a fund in the *UK*, who has no real interest in GME. There has also been a Financial times of London article published this morning.

I have also seen a post this morning showing that GME is the most traded stock on *German* stock trading apps, and is making headlines.

There's even a *Chinese* article on this (https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3618399)

What does this mean? The boomer tricks they may have been trying will be seen by **everyone** in the world. The cheats and ploys will be noticed and called out *internationally*, and the SEC can surely not let its markets be seen to be manipulated. They surely don't want to lose face? It's a bad look beating down the little man. 



There is more to retail investors than purchasing power. We have the hopes and dreams of millions, being traded so some boomer fatcat can buy a second yacht. We have **jobs** being lost as their insidious tricks drive businesses under for a quick buck. And now we have people rooting for us too.



Pair this with solid fundamentals, the pivot to e-commerce, and still the potential for Ryan Cohen to tweet *literally anything*, and I'm just thinking there is one hell of a squeeze left in this tank. 




Get out now Melvin and Co., as it's now more than your money on the line.



GME to an alternate dimension 🔮 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

BlackBerry today announced an expansion of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX® Neutrino® Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.).

The milestones build on the company’s [January 2018](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) agreement to make BlackBerry QNX’s industry-leading ISO 26262 ASIL D certified operating system (OS) the foundation for Baidu's ‘Apollo’ autonomous driving open platform.

Baidu is one of the few high-definition map vendors with an Automotive SPICE® certification from TÜV Rheinland – an industry certification that addresses rigid requirements for the software development process for Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive suppliers. With world-leading levels of data granularity, Baidu’s high-definition maps provide a critical component for global automakers looking to launch next generation connected and autonomous vehicles in China.

The QNX Neutrino RTOS foundation for Baidu’s high-definition maps is a robust real-time microkernel operating system that provides deterministic performance as well as flexibility to address the limited resources of the embedded system.

“With BlackBerry QNX's embedded software as its foundation, Baidu has made significant progress as part of its Apollo platform in establishing a commercial ecosystem for innovative technologies that OEMs can leverage for their next generation vehicles,” said Dhiraj Handa, VP, Channel, Partners and APAC, BlackBerry Technology Solutions. “We look forward to continuing to work closely with Baidu to help develop and deploy leading edge autonomous driving and connected vehicle technologies to meet the ever-increasing mission-critical and security requirements of the automotive industry.”

“We aim to provide car manufacturers with a clear and fast path to the production of autonomous vehicles, with safety and security as the top priority. The BlackBerry QNX software performs well in functional safety, network security and reliability, while Baidu has achieved long-term development in artificial intelligence and deep learning. Together, we can help car manufacturers quickly produce safe autonomous vehicles and promote the development collaboratively of the intelligent networked automobile industry,” said Wang Yunpeng, Senior Director of Technology Department of Baidu’s Intelligent Driving Group.

**About BlackBerry QNX**

As the leader in safe, secure, and reliable software for critical embedded systems, [BlackBerry® QN](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos)[X®](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) provides OEMs and Tier 1s around the world with state-of-the-art foundational software and cybersecurity technologies. BlackBerry QNX technology is used in more than 175 million vehicles on the road in their advanced driver assistance (ADAS), digital instrument clusters, connectivity modules, hands-free, and infotainment systems.

Position:194 shares at $19.28


Disclaimer: I started trading this January and my views are purely informational and I do not condone anyone making financial/trading decisions based on this post. Don’t be a retard and do your DD before you trade. This is a bullish take on BB and may have some holes in it.



So I have been watching BB for a while now and feel the company is undervalued. Forgive me as I have not made a DD post before, I failed English in high school, and I am typing this up on my phone.


BB originally caught my attention because it struck me that it survived being primarily a phone company and shifted its business to its cyber security and other software. I Put it on my watch list to swing it a little bit and recently sold 140 shares at $11.


Seeing the price go up and the volume I decided I would jump back in since the trend analysis looked pretty good. Bought in at 19.28 and it almost immediately crashed, I suspect likely due to the pullback the whole market had this morning with stimulus talks being delayed and people taking profits.


Canada Halts trading today due to the volatility followed by BB making a statement in response basically saying idk why investors are buying up the stock we haven’t made any announcements 
Trading resumes and the price rises back up beyond open in AH, closing at nearly 20 dollars.

THEN as you have already probably seen, BB announces partnership with Baidu - coincidence? Probably not, investors probably coaxed that information out of them and they likely didn’t want to get caught in some insider trading schenangians. 

Speculation for tomorrow: BB Will open strong and meet or exceed the 40% growth of today since it just got that huge news. Baidu is Chinese google, and they partnered with BB since they need a operating system platform to mass produce their maps software in autonomous/ev vehicles with their partner GAC. Now this is a lot of China talk but BB is headquartered in CANADA which is much friendlier in regards to trade than the U.S.


A little bit of information about GAC, they are a Chinese automotive giant that has came to the United States National Automobile Dealers association expos begging for investors, however has not had much success since the last 4 years have not been good for U.S. and China Trade.


The LONG game: Once our new administration warms up to China after those in charge of trade take their cuts, (and they will because history repeats itself, but right now the bear case would be that Biden is not looking to change tariffs on China, playing tough until he gets some leverage is what I think is really going on) GAC will have lots of opportunity to start putting their vehicles on our roads. 
GAC is the highest rated car brand in China so it may have a chance in the United States if it plays its cards right, which means we could have Blackberry powered Autonomous EVs on our streets in the next 5 years. That in conjunction with Amazon partnership in their future autonomous ev ventures means this company is making a major comeback and is aligned with the right companies to potentially be a major player.

This company has a lot of value in our up and coming future of Electric and Autonomous vehicles.

I am too new to this to speculate on where this stock should be valued at, but here are some resources where I got my information so you can decide for yourself:

Edit: Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit2: Looks like I was a little overzealous for today’s speculation  overlooking the fact that other people want this thing to tank back down to buy in with less risk, RBC downgraded their rating today and there have been millions of dollars worth of buy orders in the sub 18$ range. I did make a point to mention this is a long play not just some pump and dump penny stock. 💎🙌 on my shares at $19.28 - rookie mistake overlooking big boys interest in this rocket ship. Further cements the value of this company IMO. Fighting the market being down very hard looks hopeful to me 💎🙌"|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224326.csv|StockTicker

A bunch of Asperger's, WoW playing, poor ""kids"" managed to cause an epic squeeze in $GME. Make no mistake you have the attention of the big boys NOW.

&nbsp;

Now an absolute giant in the hedge fund world has gotten in, and it is against WSB. Ken Griffin (he has a camera in his office that shows his luxury car collection in the garage) may not be a name you know, but he is  a HUGE name in the hedge and quant fund world. After today and likely tomorrow, he is at risk of losing 2 Billion plus in his fund. I repeat he will NOT let this happen.

&nbsp;

These are the type of guys who do insider trading for fun at their country club. They front run clients, put out fake news stories, have direct links to the SEC board, and would literally murder everyone in here to increase their personal wealth.

&nbsp;


**What to expect  from them next:**


1. Convince (strongarm) the SEC to completely HALT trading on GME. They will make up a bullshit excuse, and force the exchange to stop allowing trades on the stock.

2. Hire big name attorneys, and force reddit to shut down WSB   
3. Pressure $GME executives to issue NEW shares at this price, and bail the shorts out. This is pretty easy for them to do. You have to understand almost all the people at this level of wealth know each other. Its a small club. 

&nbsp;



**What can you do to stop this:**

1. Bring attention to their tactics via going to the media (Twitter, NYT, Senator Elizabeth Warren or the like)

2. File SEC complaints that show that NAKED short selling is happening on GME, and is creating an actual organic move. There are more shares SHORT than their are FLOAT (traded in every day trading). This means if they covered their shorts they would have to buy every single share outstanding, and another 30% that are not actively traded.

Alright plebs, listen up, I’m about to hit you with some knowledge. If you find reading difficult and options easy, there is a TL;DR at the bottom.

Disclaimer: I am long NOK shares I bought back on Loyal3 if you can remember that long ago. Currently 1,000 shares and 10 call contracts with Jan 2023 expire 50% 5c and 50% 7c,.

I’ve been waiting ages to write this DD and contribute to the community. I couldn’t be more excited that Nokia is finally getting the attention they deserve. Their engineers have been hard at work for YEARS and their stock has not show them the appreciation they deserve.

**5G Patents:**  Nokia has over 3,000 5G Patent Declarations: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/03/24/nokia-announces-over-3000-5g-patent-declarations/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/03/24/nokia-announces-over-3000-5g-patent-declarations/)

**Current 5G contracts:** Global.

The latest significant 5G contract has been with the Port of Seattle.

NASA - $14.1 million, to start, if you don’t trust Reddit, NASA did your DD for you.

More information about current contracts: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/01/09/nokia-highlights-momentum-with-63-commercial-5g-deals/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/01/09/nokia-highlights-momentum-with-63-commercial-5g-deals/)

$600 million to Nokia and Ericsson for the United States Department of Defense.

With the Peoples Republic of China Telecom, oh I mean Huawei being removed from the United States and allies, that removes a major competitor from the market place.

**Phones:**  You got it. They are back, and they are good. I waited for ages to finally buy one, and its all they hyped it up to be. They are in the phone market to stay.

All of these figures will be 12 month trailing to 2017, in order, in thousands.

**Gross Profit:** $8,472,000 > $8,326,000 > $8,446,00 > $9,139,000

**Net Income:** $734,000 > $7,000 > -$340,000 > -1,494,000

**Operating Cash Flow:** $2,469,000 > $390,000 > $360,000 > $1,811,000

**Free Cash Flow:**  $1,936,00 > -$300,000 > -$312,000 >  $1,210,000

By lining these up we can see where management payed off debts, and made investments into the organizations future, a strategy, that by looking that the trailing twelve months, is paying off.

How has gross profit remained somewhat stable while net income increased? They have lowered operating expenses.

2019 – 2017

**Total Assets:**  $39,128,000 > $39,517,000 > $41,024,000

**Total Liabilities:**  $15,401,000 > $15,371,000 > $16,218,000

Nokia has a new CEO Pekka Lundmark who has extensive CEO experience and deep ties to the Finnish economy. After his appointment in Aug 2020 he has stuck to his guns and is working to movie Nokia back into the limelight as a technology pioneer. He has also cracked down on senior management telling them its time to shape up or ship out:  [https://www.lightreading.com/opticalip/nokia-managers-at-risk-as-ceo-warns-it-may-be-time-for-change/d/d-id/766184](https://www.lightreading.com/opticalip/nokia-managers-at-risk-as-ceo-warns-it-may-be-time-for-change/d/d-id/766184). I think this will light the fire that is needed to get the organization back on track.

All of this comes together to equal a highly undervalued company that has they key indicators of growth and stability.

Nokia for the win.

Well currently Apple is the most valuable company on Earth with a market cap of 2.41 trillion dollars.  GameStop has 70 million shares outstanding.  

That would be an infinity short squeeze to $34,000 to momentarily become the most valuable company on Earth.

More interesting however is that COB for institutional shorts increased from 24.2% to 33.3%. If you didn't already know, COB can increase exponentially if it becomes difficult to find shares to short. So this is something that needs to be paid attention to very heavily. 

Plus, as GME stock price is much higher, this will lead to much more bleeding for the shorts if they try to outlast the longs in this staring contest.

[Chart of the same thing](https://imgur.com/a/IhBXGUg)

Also, since Melvin Capital is getting a $2.75B capital injection, we can kinda assume that it's either for not getting margin called or closing their bad bets one way or another. This is a very interesting development and looks like longs have to be more patient and needn't be rabid.

I just realized mods are taking my stuff down likely because I am not posting my positions. My positions are in stock and 2/19 $30c, and pic at bottom for proof.

Alright my beautifully spectrumed friends, we are having ourselves a flat/slightly red day this morning primarily because it looks like no one is buying shares. Contracts are nice and everything, but they do not help drive the stock price up. We are here because of the one and only **CALLaway ($ELY).** As is tradition, **we are talking about a $2.5 billion market cap company that has $1.7+ billion revenues of their own and just bought Topgolf, which has revenues of $1.1+ billion and growing at ridiculous levels! 🚀**

Let's show you some of the DD provided by our $ELY gang.

[u/rwm3188](https://www.reddit.com/u/rwm3188/) mentioned yesterday:

>Great action today, I feel a sense of camaraderie with everyone who took the time to evaluate this and get in.We are just getting drowned out by GME, which is understandable. Wish we could get more eyes on this play—it’s great for someone who wants a value play, and a little bit of risk with the options, but not straight up gambling on a short squeeze. No offense to GME, I’m also holding shares there. ELY is just way more sensible to me.

[u/wagsman](https://www.reddit.com/u/wagsman/) mentioned:

>Think of all the money you save when you are a driving range and people are aiming for giant holes in the ground instead of your poor ball retrieval cart.

[u/allchalk](https://www.reddit.com/u/allchalk/) mentioned:

>The toptracer tech is really scalable. I live in a major city and there is no space to build a TopGolf without crazy construction costs, land lease rates or an hour plus drive out of the city. This is an affordable way for ranges to get a major upgrade and increase prices without much capital investment. I feel like any smart artificial turf based range is looking into this type of upgrade.

TLDR at the bottom.** 

This has come up a few times, so as a non-finance professional I want to offer some financial non-advice to anyone who has just come into a lot of money and is considering paying off their student loans right now. 

[RIGHT NOW FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS ARE FROZEN](https://studentloanhero.com/featured/student-loan-relief-extended/) until September. You aren't obligated to repay until then, and no interest is accruing. 

**PAYING OFF ZERO-INTEREST DEBT EARLY IS FUCKING STUPID.** 

That means you have until September to allow your money to keep growing, either by investing (obligatory all investments carry risk disclaimer), saving in a boomer CD, or saving in a boomer high-yield savings account. Even if my GME tendies only grew by $100 between now and then, it's still the better financial decision to grow my money and pay later than pay now.

AM I GETTING THROUGH TO YOU SMOOTH BRAINS?

Even if you have a private loan, if your interest rate is LOW ENOUGH (like less than 5%), some people (not me because I'm not a financial professional) might even say it's better to keep your money somewhere where it earns more interest, instead of paying off your loans in full. This is called interest arbitrage. 

Congratulations on all the new tendies! But for the love of god please don't be the bad kind of stupid.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Paying off zero-interest debt early is stupid as shit. Find a way to let your money continue to grow until payments resume in September.

Point72 and Citadel didn’t invest $2.75B to protect Melvin from retail investors.


IPoint72 and Citadel invested $2.75B to protect Melvin *from other whales*.


Steven Gohen (Point72) and Ken Griffin (Citadel) are two guys bailing out their buddy/former mentee who got himself in quite the pickle Gabe Plotkin (Melvin Capital). After all, these whales HAVE money, WANT MORE money, and at the very least, will do whatever it takes to not LOSE money.


But you know who else likes money? 


*Other whales.*


And you know who is likely to have deep, systemic, hyper competitive, anti-establishment, vendettas against whales that can only be resolved with financial warfare? 


*Other whales.*


Now, I haven’t done the math (I’m too autistic) but it seems pretty obvious to me that there’s now way more money (and ego points) to be made in slaying whales ie. institutional money, shorts, than slaying the minnows ie. retail money longs.


Point72 and Citadel have marked themselves as targets. They’re exposed, and can be flanked at any moment.


This seems like the perfect entry point for whales to strike down their opponent(a), settle a feud, seek revenge, make a big bag, and cover/up behind the (perceived) stupidity of retail. 



Chamath is already teasing about entering the fray on his Twitter, we know he’s cool with bankrupting billionaires. How many whales could join him, if he chooses to long-$GME? 


Thoughts?

Edit: Keep in mind, this isn’t just limited to $GME. These funds hold massive amounts of positions all across the market. They’re playing a Finite Game defending Melvin, in a sandbox with pseudo-Infinite Players that will wage this fight for non-$GME related reasons 

To use an analogy, this is the shorts are like USA occupying a foreign nation in the Middle East. Everyone there knows who the USA is, but the USA cannot distinguish who it’s true enemy/adversary is (the factions are too fragmented, too many players).


(I am not a financial advisor, I don’t know how to do anything except buy $GME stock on RH. Please don’t take this as advise. Do your own DD. Have fun. Be safe. Don’t go full retard)."|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224326.csv|StockTicker

For reasons not publicly available, Donny Foss acquired 3.5 million shares of GME on or about February 28, 2020. [The number of shares he bought was so large that it constitutes 5.3% of the company and triggered SEC filings on Edgar disclosing his purchase.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000110465920030651/tv538831_sc13g.htm) At the time, GME was worth under $4 a share. You autists have since driven his $14 million or so stake up to over $588 million dollars as of this posting. He is therefore I assume the largest profit maker off GME by far. One has to wonder if he knew the same things DFV did but months earlier.|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224326.csv|StockTicker

I posted ""Me please."" As I was working in my garage not expecting anything.  I go back inside and 1 hour later I saw that he messaged me asking for my address and this man delivered!!!!

He asked me what I wanted and I didn't want to be greedy and said anything would be awesome and I'm stoked just at the thought of this happening and a burrito would be cool.

This GME brother bought me a steak with loaded mashed potatoes, mac and cheese and a cheesecake from outback steakhouse.

I am so thankful and grateful for discovering WSB one year ago. You helped me turn my -70% portfolio into +116% this pass week. 

Thank you to all the 💎 👐. Thank you $GME. Thank you Papa Cohen and Papa Elon for taking us to tendie land. I love you all and have a good night.

Also I am going to pay it forward and the first person to message me will get dinner on me!

Gather round fellow autists, come one, come all. I've got quite the story to tell you all. Now, this isn't my story, but the story of a little company called Microvision (MVIS).

**Skip to the competition section for the smooth brain logic on why we will 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

**DISCLAIMER: AM AS RETARDED AS YOU ALL. I used every last brain cell I have to write this DD so we can all enjoy tendies once we moon** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 **POSITIONS AT BOTTOM**

&#x200B;

**A LOT of this DD has been done by people that are way smarter than I over at** [r/MVIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/)\*\*. Those saints have an unreal DD that I will link\*\* [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/geaykw/dd_for_new_investors_crash_course_in_mvis/) **and a 'Best of MVIS' thread** [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/hrihan/the_best_of_rmvis_meta_thread/)**. Most of us here don't know how to read so I will take that DD and make this as simple as possible. Here are some facts...**

&#x200B;

# FACT - Microvision is best in class (LiDAR, MEMS, etc.)

This is another FACT. Microvision's LiDAR is the **BEST IN CLASS. See the image below for a comparison between the competition. This ALONE MEANS THEY ARE MASSIVELY UNDERVALUED.**

&#x200B;

[Clearly, they are BEST IN CLASS](https://preview.redd.it/14zt6mmxgpd61.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=c60f7170a195aafced5a0f60255a2dfc832e5b85)

From the chart above, clearly, they have the best LiDAR! **NOT ONLY ARE THE SPECS BETTER BUT THEIR A-SAMPLE IS GOING TO BE SHOWN OFF AROUND APRIL.** More than that, **THEY WILL BE READY FOR PRODUCTION GOING INTO THE FALL OF THIS YEAR!!** Which also makes them **FIRST TO MARKET** with a product like their LiDAR.

**TL:DR - MVIS IS BEST IN CLASS LIDAR** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

# FACT - Microvisions MEMS display hardware is used by Microsoft in the Hololens 2 and [IVAS](https://old.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/k9ge4v/defense_bill_clears_house_with_vetoproof_majority/) ([BAD.ASS.](https://old.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/k45io6/ivas_photo_80deg_horz_fov_waveguides_in_action/))

This isn't opinion, it is a simple fact. Those at Microvision and Microsoft will not actually acknowledge this fact, rumor is because they've been under an NDA for the last year or so. Every time either company is asked, they seem to deflect and name every other company like MVIS but not actually MVIS. WELL, [u/s2upid](https://www.reddit.com/u/s2upid/) over from [r/MVIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/) decided to take matters into his own hands. This many dropped $3,000 last spring just so he could DESTROY the device and find those pesky MVIS chips inside. [Looks like he found what he was looking for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/gm1i2f/hololens_2_teardown_the_hunt_for_mvis/) This begs the question, why is this partnership so secretive? Well, the major rumor floating around right now is a **buyout from Microsoft.** Them being so secretive makes sense as MVIS has the best in class MEMS (and LiDAR), and it would make sense they don't want to get into a bidding war.

PS. Microsoft also has a US government contract to supply the military with modified Hololens 2s called IVIS which are purposely modified and geared toward military use and operations.

**US Gov contracts = $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$**

**TL:DR - POTENTIAL MSFT BUYOUT**🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

# FACT - Microvisions isn't only LiDAR and MEMS

The fact here is that MVIS has **FIVE** potential verticals they can sell!

* Display only devices
* Interactive devices
* NED devices
* Consumer LiDAR
* Auto LiDAR

I'm not sure how many of you can even read this many words in a year. Who the hell knows the potential of these verticals. Or what hardware is in each one. Or the cross-vertical applications of the hardware. My brain is short-circuiting even trying to think of words to think about this thought.

**TL:DR -** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

# Okay, this is getting long so let me wrap up with the most important point...

# MVIS Competition

So far the two main competitors for Microvisions LiDAR are looking like **Luminar (LAZR)** and **Velodyne (VLDR). Let's look at some simple numbers.**

**Luminar (LAZR)**

* **Stock Price - $37.45**
* **Market Cap - 12.13B**
* **Float - 177.19M**
* **Shares outstanding - 218.82M**

**Velodyne (VLDR)**

* **Stock Price - $23.53**
* **Market Cap - 3.97B**
* **Float - 55.52M**
* **Shares Outstanding - 168.71M**

**Wow!** Look at those market caps! Now let's see how Microvision compares...

**Microvision (MVIS)**

* **Stock Price - $7.25**
* **Market Cap - 1.097B**
* **Float - 145.69M**
* **Shares outstanding - 151.31M**

# WAIT A SECOND! I THOUGHT YOU SAID MICROVISION WAS BEST IN CLASS?!!?!?!?!?!?!??! WHY DO THEY HAVE NO MARKET CAP?!?!?!?!?

Well fellow autists, this is where the undervaluation comes into play. **LAZR**, who just started talking about LiDAR and aren't anywhere close to where **MVIS** is, is valued at **12x the valuation of MVIS**. **Yet, MVIS has the best in class LiDAR, first to market, and FOUR OTHER VERTICALS BESIDES LiDAR. Same with VLDR, trading at 4x MVIS with only the LiDAR vertical.**

**This is where the play becomes really juicy.** Let's play with some valuation numbers. If Microvision is even **CLOSE** to delivering on their LiDAR promises, shouldn't they be valued at **AT LEAST VLDR?** Well, let's play and see how that works out...

**Let's work with $7 as each billion in valuation for MVIS,** VLDR is 4B which is 4x MVIS. **So $7 per billion \* 4 = $28 stock price**. Keep in mind, this isn't even them being best in class, this is just average for **ONE VERTICAL.**

**So let's work it with a LAZR valuation, which is 12x MVIS currently. So $7 per billion \* 12 = $84 stock price! AND THAT IS STILL ONLY ONE VERTICAL!**

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

I wonder how many of you even made it this far. Probably no one so just remember **MVIS actual valuation should be 4-12x what it currently is! So many tendies.** I'll link in a few more DDs if anyone is interested in reading a bit more in-depth. I highly recommend going to check out [r/MVIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/) as I would be nowhere without their genius. 100% best DD on Reddit outside WSB.

All right retards,

Some of you may have noticed RH increased their margin requirement on $GME for us. 

This is a GOOD THING. Far too long I have sat on the sidelines in a margin account thinking I was helping out.
Today is the day I transition to a cash account.

Why is this a good thing? Because if I change to a cash account RH can't pimp out my girlfriend $GME to the shorts who so desperately want to DP her sideways.

If you're holding $GME and can't buy anymore because your second mortgage is taking time to process, but you still want to help out, transition to a cash account to protect your GF.

Also, remember this could be a long game, I am begging you from the tip of penis to not get discouraged no matter what happens.

The bomb has not been dropped. When Cohen and the Company release any news, this will blow up. Until then, hold and wait.

I love you all.


Positions shown and I like the stock and truly believe in GME with or without the squeeze (which will cum).

DONT LET THE AFTER HOURS MANDINGO ROCKET PUT YOU IN A STATE OF EUPHORIA. Be prepared for a dip shortly after open. 

I just said this weekend that I was not going to take a position but you mother fuckers got me. The energy is inescapable, it’s intoxicating, therefore I’m in. Although it’s a small position (for now) I am fully committed. 

Now, I’m not saying that a dip will happen but it could. And if we are all in a euphoric state that dip will come in and crush many a spirit. BE PREPARED. If it does dip, that will be a pivotal point in winning the war and flying to the edge of the universe and beyond. They will come out fighting. It could be one of their last pushes before the real squeeze starts. But they’re injured. Don’t misjudge the injured opponent. Show the big bois the same mercy they would show if the table were flipped: none. 

I hope the dip doesn’t happen and we fly. But don’t be complacent. Be ready for the dip and press forward. I personally am holding till I have no fucking idea. $1k+? And I am fully prepared to buy the mother fucking dip. Rest up soldiers, the real battle begins tomorrow.

Man I went from cheering you fuckers on from the sidelines to being so FUCKING HYPED ready to fly goddamn interstellar space. You guys are something else!

Saw in a post on the options subreddit: 

“The New York Stock Exchange announced that NYSE American *Options* and NYSE  Arca *Options* have revised the quote spread requirement as follows: GameStop(GME) to $20.00 wide, or $25.00 wide when the bid is greater than $100.00, and iRobot (IRBT) to $10  wide. These modified bid/ask differentials will be in effect through the March 19 expiration cycle, the exchange said.”

This helps as we climb up, the ceiling can go much higher now, but REMEMBER THAT THIS MEANS WHEN IT COMES DOWN IT CAN COME DOWN FAST SO BE PREPARED TO BUY IF YOU ARE SO INCLINED.

It's dominating movements in most meme stocks presently. GME likely more dominated by capital inflows this week than short-term gamma (new buyers + short covering vs old sellers), but significant Friday unwind possible at very high price levels (over $115 specifically)**

Finally got good data on option OI this morning. I think GME may be greatly understated on these charts.

I added a new chart today from SpotGamma. Their product is really great, love it a lot. You have to add the put and call lines together to see dealer behaviors. As you go up in price, they are buying more, so it's kind of inverted in buying effects.

GME: Gamma dominated recently, and gamma dominated in coming months. Less so today at these prices. Gamma ramp falloff after 115, big danger at 60 - sharp ramp. Less volatile  before 110 and after 65 or so. I think spot gamma is slightly understating the total gamma at risk here and think dealers own more.  Additionally, GME has substantial expirations on friday which could cause a meltdown in some scenarios. I don't think that is in the interests of dealers though, so maybe it's more gentle and doesn't drop past 60. In an event that the price absolutely collapsed, they'd lose money.  **But - Really, buying inflows are dominating this as much as gamma is. A lot could happen for bulls or bears here, and the short squeeze is a thing this week and also can have very large imapct, on the order of gamma possibilities or more.**  **I think most price action of this stock to the upside has to be short covering, further retail buying - NOT gamma this week.** there’s also a dehedging of Friday expiry that will happen throughout the week and will cause things to move, I’ll calculate. Options 30 and 40% out of the money are adding real delta right now. Wow.

**EDIT 12:11pm NY Time Tues: GME Unwind Data:** At the current price of $89, dealers are holding about 6.5m shares long to hedge friday. As we approach Friday, this number drops to about 4.5m, causing weak selling at this price. Once Friday is over, at this price, those 4.5m shares get rolled or sold, which is some moderate selling. At a price of $110, there's buying of about 1.5m shares, followed by a rolling/selling of 8m shares friday. At a price of $59, dealers-shift hedges at 6m shares sold between now and friday, and then friday unload is neutral. In other words, for the price range we are in, there's very slight dealer selling over time. As price goes down, that accelerates even if the price is flat, and friday starts to be a net buy by dealers on friday towards close under 60. For prices over 110, dealers start to net buy leading into friday, then have a large net sell/roll into close. For insane prices, like $120+, dealers hold 11m shares going into friday, which roll off or are delivered or sold. Therefore, in most cases, **Friday unwind is moderate in scope, not large, being half the size of the stack that unwound 2 weeks ago and caused a 10% down day. The entire option stack is loaded however, per the chart. If price is $116+, the unwind is more potent and is similar to 2 weeks ago.**

**PLTR**: Heavy gamma influenced, but less than some of the other stocks. More downside than upside with gamma, but an OK ramp up, not great.

**BBBY**: Gamma dominated. More ramp down than up. Danger in that ramp from 30 to 20. Yikes

**BB**: Gamma influenced, but not dominated, OI is smaller relative to float. Healthy ramp up.

**Edit: After Close Tuesday GME:** My analysis is this looks like primarily new money. Gamma should've only been 8 million shares between open and $120, then a mere trickle after that. I'm sure you guys added some options, so call it 10 or 11. That does mean dealers now have perhaps as much as the float in shares, which is an interesting situation. After that, it was pure retail inflows, likely on the order of over a billion dollars. I think some shorts covered, but borrowdesk had no shares last I checked, so it looks like lots of people short.  Obviously, no one can predict where this can go, but per my prior comments, we are now in a bubble phase. Bubbles pop when capital inflows flip. Lifting each $10 takes the same amount of capital as the last $10, probably a few hundred million dollars per $10 rise, so % changes get harder. Are we at peak inflows today? No idea. But you can cross gamma off the table for now. Gamma isn't driving this right now at these price levels, inflows are driving this. I don't think short covering is a factor because while some shorts are covering, shares still hard to borrow. 

*My positions: was short GME but option OI not juicy enough, so left position. Will enter put spreads if prices are higher ahead of friday, will enter long if prices very low like under $60. Long BB. Long BBBY. Long PLTR via an indirect vehicle. Betting on WSB continue gamma stuff basically.*"|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224329.csv|StockTicker

Put on your tinfoil hats (over or under the helmet you might already be wearing) and conspire with me. 

I think that time is when a few big players received margin calls to cover, but instead of buying the shares back, which obviously would’ve skyrocketed the price even more, they sold tons of other positions to meet the margin requirements. From that, the market went flaccid right quick, right at 10:46. 

Also side note, where are the risk management departments for these funds??? They could easily hedge their risk by purchasing shares/calls (we might then go to the edge of the observable universe), but they don’t/won’t and I can’t figure out why. Having been in the industry, it’s completely asinine to subject your investors to that kind of irresponsible risk, especially if they’re registered as a fiduciary. 

Back to the reason I’m drinking. This selling of other positions could have caused the algos (because let’s be real, I know very few of you goobers sold on the way down if you didn’t sell at 155) to quickly sell GME as the market was taking that quick plunge as well. This domino effect after each halt, paired with new shorts entering to try and shake the paper hands, well you know the rest... 

Great news though be not afraid! As I know others have said, the gap has been filled and we finished up bigly. This is great news, as we won’t have to dip down there tm or any other day this week or next. Doesn’t mean this isn’t possible, it just makes things easier on the mind.

I haven't talked to my WS people on the borrow situation. In my day, the best place to short stuff like this was actually the retail brokers, but NO hedge funds prime at these brokers and generally can't access these pools easily. A smart hedge fund has a little money at every broker he can, but it makes accounting and reconciliation a royal pain in the ass. Most hedge funds have 1-4 prime brokers. The very biggest have an account everywhere, but folks keep it centralized. Of course those prime brokers try to go around get 'borrow' for their clients, but typically they need to have someone custodial assets long (someone who owns gamestop) and then the rate is competitive. However, I'm pretty sure RH can give a locate/borrow to someone like Morgan Stanley (who incidentally bought eTrade). The borrow world is extremely opaque. IBKR sources borrows from lots of sources but they're a bit unique. It isn't uncommon from what I'm told for one desk to be paying a 50% fee to the client/lender and charging 75% to the borrower, capturing quite the spread. Back when I was short MNKD, the rate eclipsed 100%. Anyone know where it's at now?
  The next thing I'd say is the Melvin situation is unprecedented. SAC and Citadel have a lot of capital, but in the scheme of things, they're still hedge funds that aren't 10x or 100x bigger than Melvin. Well, there really aren't any hedge funds 10x bigger than Melvin, and the one that does exist (Bridgewater) doesn't get involved in individual stocks. The rest that are close are basically SAC, Citadel, etc, but they're only 2-5x bigger.
  The real question is, is Melvin out or not. My guess is they MUST have made the trade smaller given their losses. If I were Gabe I'd try to work the losses off, take a sort of ""one time charge"" (not really a thing in HFs) and move on. With discounted fees on new money he might survive, despite this being a big risk-management failure, it is quite the black/white swan. But I don't see Citadel/SAC investing knowing this trade is still on. That brings me to the next point.
  Yes, in the long run, I am bearish on GME. That means in 24 months the stock will almost certainly be lower than where it is today. That's what I do. I'm an investor. I've never been a great trader. That's probably because it's very hard to be a great trader. Even the best traders (think Cohen) are right around 55-60% of the time. You have to be nimble and accept losses quickly. Anything can happen here in the short run. Anything. The stock could go to 1,000. It'd be really stupid, but it could happen. I'm sure some of you are familiar with the ""max pain"" theory, that stocks tend to take the path that causes the most pain. That would be it.
  That doesn't mean I anything anyone should be buying GME. This is just the biggest poker game that ever has been played. It's really breathtaking. Longs know what their ultimate fate is, but it is sort of like Wily E Coyote. Whoever blinks first loses. In situations like this, I have found that BOTH sides typically lose. How? The shorts get blown up, obviously. After they get blown away, the greedy longs get blown up. The first-to-the-long guys are usually out pretty quickly (think 4 to 8, I'm done!) and the only ones who win. The first to the short guys typically stop out (idiots) or dig in (bigger idiots). If they dig in they almost never ride it out and get ""bought in"" or lose all their AUM through withdrawals or sometimes ""blow up"" (lose 100%+ of their capital). Blowing up means brokers take a loss, eg their prime broker. If I'm MS (Morgan Stanley) or someone like that, I'd be talking about my risk exposure to this trade lol. It reminds me of the old saying, ""lose $1 million, you have a big problem. lose $100 million, the bank has a big fucking problem."" At some point the chain of custody of the loss passes from LPs to the bank/brokerage. I'm sure some small hedge funds have already been wiped out.
  So, long story short (or short story long?), I still am firmly convinced GME is going nowhere from a fundamental standpoint. There will be no miracle Ryan turnaround that ever makes it worth $100+. But that doesn't mean the stock won't go up today, tomorrow, or even this whole quarter or half of the year or whole year. This is all a crazy Wall Street speculative frenzy and buying begets buying. I think there's a 30% chance it's all over and it goes down quite soon. A 30% chance it goes up, still quite a bit (30-50%) and blows off and then it's all over relatively soon. And then there's a 30% chance it doubles and then drops. And a 10% chance it could go up 10x before it is halted or there is some rule change or it eventually cracks.
  Whatever happens, you all made history. I'm kind of proud and kind of sick. Most importantly, I wish I was long! No position. Asked my people to look into shorting it over the weekend and told them today, yeaaah don't do that. I almost never trade as it's pretty difficult to invest from here and I think this one is probably too tricky to figure out without access to information (borrow movements, fund returns, etc.) If I had access to what all the borrow desks on the street are doing, friends at every fund who is a player in this debacle, returns from the funds themselves, one could kind of map out what is happening. Robin Hood level information would be the best, but clearly no one has that (except for Citadel lol). 
  Good luck to all, be careful (don't have more than half of your money in GME, don't use margin) and I hope you all make a fortune.

Why? Because market makers are jacking up margin requirements in an effort to make investors sell GME.

**With margin, you don't even have to lose money to be margin called:**

In this case of GME shares, they simply increased Margin requirements from 100% to 80%. Instead of $20,000 margin for GME, now you can only use $16,000. But you already had $20,000 of margin invested in GME, now they will tell you that you must deposit $4,000 to cover that gap.

**But.**

You can just sell $4,000 of **ANY** positions to fix the Margin Call, you do NOT have to actually deposit $4,000. Robinhood is informative about your options to solve the call but not sure with other brokerages. I commented on Margin on some posts here on WSB, and got a ton of questions about how margin works. **This is for the new guys who don't understand how institutions manipulate and steal from you yet.**

&#x200B;

**How do I know if I am using Margin??**

I only really know for Robinhood users. If you use a different brokerage just google how to find out.

Desktop: Account -> Settings -> Margin Investing (Enabled, Disabled)

Mobile: Profile -> Settings -> Robinhood Gold -> Margin Investing (on/off).

&#x200B;

***TL;DR***: Don't use margin to gamble, especially on extremely volatile stocks like GME! Margin should only ever really be considered for collateral (selling cash-secured puts). And don't be fooled into depositing when you don't have to. Buying on Margin also actually helps the big institutions!

**Rest assured, even though RH is trying to force me to sell 40 GME shares, IM NOT FUCKING SELLING! I'm holding through my Margin Call!** **GME**  💎  🤲   **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**

At open GME ripped and LB/BABA/FISV (Melvin's holdings) took a complete shit because they started liquidating to pay for GME, then they got bailed out and bought their shares back.

Average volume of LB is 3m shares. Melvin sold 1M in an hour and tanked the share price 10% on Monday. Melvin owns 25M shares of LB, or 1/9th of the entire float.

LB closed 20% of their Victoria's Secret stores this year due to covid, and Amazon is literally killing them.

If you want a low premium play, buy LB puts for this GME squeeze.

**EDIT:** You want LB puts instead of their other holdings because LB is their holding with the highest percentage of float.

We've all seen the memes, and the convincing rants, but here I present something different.

The horizontal blue lines with their price marked on the right, are going to be critical levels during the march upward. You can see that the $25-$40 are is going to be a helluva fight, but its a straight shot up to $70 from that point. Above $70, looks like room to high $80s-low$90s, then absolute chaos to the top with ATH at $148. There will be many unforeseen events along the way, and we can not plan for everything.  

The current levels that we are in need to be held until then. We just had a massive gap up the past couple days, so don't be discouraged if BB flails around, and seems stagnant for the next few days, it is natural. Just buy up every dip and we will be knocking on the $40-$70 area in no time.

HEAR THIS!: 

I am in no way trying to take away from the GME momo. I am in the thick of it with the rest of you tards, and will be until the very end. BB has been, and will continue to be a huge play for months to come, and we should all be excited about that. There is no need to have a competition right now, we need to stick together, seeing how the suits are trying to incite rifts within. Stay strong. The tendie Kingdom is vast, and we shall be there in step, together. 

🚀$BB💪$GME🚀

Disclaimer: I am a retard with a computer, not a qualified suit to give you investment advice. This is merely a technical perspective, from my point of view. I am long in GME and BB, and I will continue to buy both.

eSports is on the rise in the United States and the need for a eSports Gaming ""Gamestop?"" League EGL is here. While leagues and competitions can be held online they aren't without their caveats. Differences in internet and computer hardware can prove critical to a gamers ability to perform. 

I believe a physical location with standardized high performance gear and internet is required to go forward if there is to be any more growth and adoption past it's normal target audience.

If done properly and well it could augment GameStop’s customer base to not only become customers but become the audience and competitors. Matches can be streamed and monetized. Competitors can compete at all levels ""City/State/National"". 

Merchandise, Sponsorships, Partnerships.

But I digress..

**WHY GAMESTOP?!?**

They have the customer base, they have the locations and with a little capital can ramp this up quick. They have even started already…

[https://gspc.gg/](https://gspc.gg/)

As a gaming enthusiast I have been waiting for the entrance of a true US eSports giant to rear its head. Much like all sports started with friendly competition, they eventually developed into the jaw dropping revenue producing markets we see today.

The NFL generated 15 Billion in revenue.

For more details, i will keep my sources at the end. (I'm really sorry about my english in this short DD, i'm from non-american country)

&#x200B;

**Great Expansion. /**

Since December, BB announced big surprises on the level of expansions of their company. 

7 December 2020 - We're talking about the co-development with **Amazon** of BlackBerry IVY,  a cloud-connected intelligent vehicle data platform.

25 January 2021 -  Partnership with **Baidu** of BlackBerry QNX, a software who's going to change the world of automobile. Used for a functional safety, a network security and reliability.  This announce about the creation of a good systems who can be implemted in every majors devices in long terms.

We're not talking about the OEM partners who are already with BlackBerry like **DELL** and **Infima**.

&#x200B;

**No Risk. /**

**192%** in **1 Month**, Looks alot if you see it this way. But is it really ?

Short Term - BlackBerry have an undervaluation for what it will come. The expansion of the company and the news who came since last year had a great impact. We think **192%** is a Pump and Dump, but the real answer is the road of 6$ to 19$ who is really small of what the company can really achieve. There is a large room to grow into in a short time if we think about the fact BB achieved **138$** in 2007. Why not 100$ ? They are still BlackBerry no ?

Medium Term - BlackBerry already announced 2 larges connections with giant companies in less than 2 months, they are ready for something or they need to make it big. That's where i want you to think, they will need to make the most connections in 2021 for installing their ''power'' in the market. Now we have BlackBerry who have a **100% success rate in safety and security certifications,** it will be a major change when it will be installed and known of every devices fabricants. And it will happen before 2022.

Long Term - The best one about me. We talk about BlackBerry, dealing additionnal co-operation with larges enterprise with the future already writed in their head. Their software and their utilisation worldwide will be not only huge, but attractive. The competition in this sector is old and not adjusted of what cyberattacks can come. BB already had the experiance of owning a large chunk of the market with Smartphones, do you really think it will be hard for them again ? Don't think 19 US$ is high if you think holding BlackBerry for years, it's a steal. literally.

&#x200B;

**BlackBerry Itself. /**

We're talking about the great expension BB has and about the international development of the software, but do you really know BlackBerry ?

Hacking, like this it looks not a big deal. But do you really know the impact it has ?

**12 May 2017** \- 80 Hospitals in England were affected by a Ransomware, writing patients on paper and pen

**July 2017** \- Equinax ,byberattack over **143 million American, Canadian and British customers** as well as **200,000 credit card numbers.** They had a simple vulnerability

**January 2021** \- Central Bank of New Zealand, security breach was found, 50 customers were affected. **20 YEARS OLD** software wasn't updated.

I could continue all night long about security software who are not updated or not enough fiable for today world. BlackBerry have, and will take, the advantage of making their presence in the market really soon, like we saw. What i really love about BlackBerry is that they don't stop innoving they product, they stopped working on their Smartphone for being full-time on what will come soon. They are extremely good in their domain and they will kill when coming in the market !

&#x200B;

BlackBerry re-invents itself, and you can join them.

&#x200B;

In Resume : BB best thing to buy now

1. Appointment of New Director, Lauren Friedman, she immediately received 15,026 restricted stock units, to be vest over three years
2. This is a big one, CEO, Alex Karp amends his equity awards.

if the Company experiences a Change in Control, and Mr. Karp remains a Service Provider through immediately prior to such Change in Control, a number of shares subject to the applicable Karp Award will accelerate and fully vest immediately prior to such Change in Control equal to the greater of (i) 20% of the shares subject to the applicable Karp Award or (ii) 50% of the then-unvested shares subject to the applicable Karp Award as of immediately prior to the application of such acceleration.

Here's the link to the Filing: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312521013558/d949109d8k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312521013558/d949109d8k.htm)

Does anyone know what the implications are from this filing?  Imo, it seems like there's going to be some big announcements on demo day, and will drive the stock up, and Karp will do a bit of profit-taking right after, although he should still have a big stake in the company.

So, these numbers are pretty indicative of the extremely bullish market sentiment regarding Nokia, which on its own is great for both the company and investors. But how could these options drive the price of NOK? 

Current total Call Options ($5, $7, $10) = 1,008,515 = 100,851,500 shares

&#x200B;

Now let's look at the top institutional holders of NOK as of 29 September 2020:

[From cnn.com](https://preview.redd.it/puthg1tuyqd61.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef33064e0d9f0b78593de2701929d20353f2bc2e)

In mid February, the new 13f filings will be released so that we can see up-to-date institutional holdings. What will that tell us? Basically, we'll be able to look at the big boys who are writing these option contracts to determine whether or not they have adequately covered. 

What happens if they didn't hedge their calls? As the price rises over $5, $7, and $10 we will see very high volume buys so that these institutions can manage their risk.

**Alternatively, we can look at the charts to see if this is already happening.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Unfortunately there is no data for what the OI for $4.50 calls were on 25 Jan 2021, so this is what we'll have to use.

|Type|Strike Price|Open Interest Total|Shares|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Call|$4.50|43,879|4,387,900|
|Call|$5.00|459,590|45,959,000|

On 25 January, immediately before opening, the stock price hit $4.50 which triggered a massive buy from institutional holders who had written those call options.

[26 Jan 2021 Market Open](https://preview.redd.it/4k7lo0ia6rd61.png?width=278&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee061d431c2993b37e14f2ced3aad1a27a90b1d1)

On 26 January, immediately before market opening, the stock price his $5.00 which triggered a massive buy from institutional holders followed by what looks to be high volume short-selling from institutions to cover the \~100,000+ Put options that are in the market.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**What does this all mean?**

Price volatility/ramping is already happening. More people are buying both ITM and OTM calls, and the institutions who write them are already needing to buy shares in order to cover. This will continue to happen as NOK pushes beyond the $5 mark. 

It also means that nearly ALL Put options at $5 have been covered thus far, which means that we shouldn't expect to see the price get forced downward like this morning again.

If you are holding this stock long or short, don't be intimidated by the high volatility. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR**

Today was really high volatility around $5 as institutions covered their call/put options.

Hey, it's your boy ~~Chimpu~~ Tsukune Surprise.

This past weekend I posted some DD on the squeezes.  Yes, fucking plural you illiterate retard.

Many of you messaged me and said you enjoyed it.  Although I'm not sure how many people could actually read it.  I think most of you liked the pretty colors and lines.

[Here's my original post on the squeezes and DD.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4bnfr/moatadd_for_the_moass_there_will_be_more_than_one/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

I updated my TA for today's market close.  The TA does not include the absolute face ripping toboggan ride on your mom's river of squirt.  So whatever is in the document- just add some Peter North ropes of extra Gentleman's Relish (TM) to the top.

[Here's the the new file here for your masturbatory needs.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UvgkRd3LT7msm1vkHGOqq9kx4FU_suAz/view?usp=sharing)  Just scroll to the bottom for the updated technicals.  I kept the background DD in the document for you shit fuckers that haven't read it yet.

I'm still recording the audio book version for those of you busy licking fucking windows.

Here's the summary of what has changed.  Tighten your helmets and bibs.

Now, I know there's a lot of technical analysis that will tell you to hold GME and you absolutely should. I want to tell you something else: we have the energy of the world on our side.

For those of you who are not familiar with Tarot, it's a deck of cards that tell you what will happen. Not what might happen, what **WILL** happen.  And if you don't want to read this whole thing, I will tell you this: we have literally everything pointing to success.

I kept it simple and did a Journey Spread of 7 cards to pull and I wrote explanations so even the dumbest of us can understand just how fucking ready we are. LESSS GOOO!

# Cards 1 - 3: Leaving - What are we leaving behind as we go on our journey, what is holding us back.

https://preview.redd.it/quwkfv7j3md61.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8bec3dcc6b93fda75933577cd78e79aee7a3be2

1. Ten of Swords - Swords rarellllly mean anything good and the Ten of Swords is a defining card in that suit. ToS (!!!!!!) represents misfortune, desolation, burdens to bear, ruin, the end of delusions. Very few people thought GME was going anywhere, me included. I was wrong. It's going to the moon so we have to leave that shit behind.
2. Ten of Pentacles - Getting a bunch of 10s here (obviously referencing that GME is getting to 100 at the open). But the ten of pentacles is important for us to leave behind because this bitch wants you to enjoy the affluence you already have achieved. I gotta say fuck that because you know what's better than a lambo? Two fucking lambos filled with hookers and all the blow you could want. Also peanut butter snacks.
3. Five of Swords - Have you ever fought a goose? Geese are notoriously shitty. We, as a society, made a fucking video game about why they suck. FoS is a sign of discord and conflict turning you away from your fellow autists. This is the sign that we need to leave the selfishness behind and band together to beat back the cabal of Melvin, Shitron, and whoever else feels like they haven't lost enough money already. They are the geese. Fuck geese.

# Card 4: Why - This card tells you why you are being called to embark on this journey.

https://preview.redd.it/ysof5n1l3md61.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f17fc8550a9b4319763fe035765a93d86f68a9a2

4) Knight of Pentacles - If you have any doubts about why we're doing this, this dragon-riding motherfucker wants you to stay the fucking course. You know why we're doing this? Because we fucking know where this is going and we're riding our motherfucking dragons all the way to the moon.

# Card 5: Star - What is guiding or leading you on this journey.

https://preview.redd.it/ykfsc9om3md61.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29d312c53bc91c24b8d7e49c0887482cb9edd6f2

5) Queen of Pentacles - I've pulled so many pentacles in this spread due to the inherent nature of their financial metaphor in most of the tarot world. In this case, the KWEEN of money is showing us the way. She's telling you that we can rely on her energy, sharing it all with us dumbasses who put our life's savings into GME. Look, we are all getting our energy from u/DeepFuckingValue. Like I said, this shit is never wrong.

# Card #6: Challenge - This card shows a challenge you will face on your journey.

https://preview.redd.it/xe7f0wfo3md61.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29a1ba0cc2cc9c025943c3cb5d998b9fbd7e0a7f

6) King of Wands - The king of BDE himself. He represents every motherfucking hedge fund pussy waiting for you to sell so they can buy their yacht and bang our girlfriend. He's relentless in changing the rules and trying to fuck us over so that he can make bonus numbers. This is what we're up against and we can't give in even when they're shooting dragon energy out of their backs.

# Card #7 - Destination: This card shows what you are moving toward. This is the place that you (or your higher self) will reach.

https://preview.redd.it/r0h0pp1q3md61.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b76948d8ef49a589e459082bcf49ffb31e0a9bb4

7)  XX Judgement - A major arcana as our destination? Hold your tits people. She's literally playing the song of destiny calling us towards more tendies than you could imagine. This is a new start for all of us once we triple our networths. There could not be a more telling sign except:

# BONUS ENERGY PULL

https://preview.redd.it/c49j6kwr3md61.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=766becb5e5f4d3e5f168928ee8eb143c9c3b1c24

HELL FUCKING YESSSSSSS. In the olden days, Egyptians saw lizards as the guardians of good fortune and divine wisdom. Today, they will be the fucking mascot of us winning our tendies and guard our new wealth. It's already ours people. That motherfuckering lizard energy is what we're carrying forward into tomorrow and this week.

Good luck you fuckers.

I actually believe hedge funds will now try and blow up Melvin and its backers so the bull case is stronger than ever.

That being said, they can break the squeeze if

1) Big money triggers a sharp broad based selloff

2) GME issues a huge amount of shares and dilutes- would have to be a monstrous issue

3) GME insiders sell their stakes

4) More margin fuckery with brokers / exchange fuckery halting trading for an SEC investigation

Watching you ride this wave is wild, and I'm rooting for you every day.

Now, let me tell you a tale about a company that will give you the only reason you need to dump all your ill gotten gains into PLTR. Positions at the end.

This company began in the late 70s when a nerdy software developer decided to turn her thesis project of a scalable healthcare database into a commercial product. You see, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, etc... all need a place to document all their patient care. Paper charts haven't cut it since like 2002. 

So, this nerd got a band of misfits together, rented a small office space, and began coding and selling. Within 35 years, she was CEO of the largest market share electronic medical record company in the country, with revenue exceeding $2 billion, no debt on the books, and a corporate campus the size of a small town.

The company is Epic Systems. You may never have heard of them because they're still private, but there's almost a 100% chance your medical data is in their databases if you've seen a doctor in the United States in the past 10 years.

How'd they fucking do it? Well, let me tell you , and let me tell you why it means you should dip your balls into the lukewarm cup of PLTR and let lady tendies blow through the straw into your ballcuzzi.

Epic took ownership of the IT projects from the customers. Healthcare systems had all sorts of IT solutions in place from homegrown systems to cobbled together solutions from other vendors. The moat was thicc. But Epic said, don't you worry Mr. CEO MD, we'll do the heavy lifting. So this company hired an army of kids right out of college, taught them the software, and set them loose to implement and maintain it at hospitals everywhere.

Their philosophy? Epic owns the success of the install. The customer licenses the software, and Epic, with its literal hoard of 3.9 - 4.0 GPA college age millennials, do everything in their power to make sure the project is successful. The hallways of that campus are littered with burnt out Type A overachievers bending over backwards to make sure nothing slips through the cracks.

Why does this matter you ask? Palantir is doing the exact same fucking thing. Their implementation model is telling the customer to sit back and let the Gen Z wizards at the company take care of doing what needs done. Boomer IT departments can focus on making sure people get their emails and can make phone calls while real engineers do the hard work.

Look at this quote from [their own website](https://www.palantir.com/careers/teams/deployment-strategists). How can you possibly say, ""Sit back and let our smart people handle this shit,"" any better?

""Deployment Strategists stand at the front lines of Palantir. We work directly with customers to deliver value from their data, and ensure they’re using our products as effectively as possible to solve problems.

As Deployment Strategists, we combine a passion for technology with an ability to navigate organizational hurdles. We instinctively gravitate toward project ownership and team leadership. We present a comprehensive, compelling vision for how our software can transform the way our customers use data, then we test that vision through experimentation, iteration, and execution. Working side by side with our [Forward Deployed Engineers](https://www.palantir.com/careers/teams/forward-deployed-software-engineers), we find our way to solutions: through messy data, through bureaucratic labyrinths, through sandstorms in “data centers” made of tents and suitcases. Whatever it takes, we figure out how to do it.

The problems we solve are extraordinarily diverse, and so are we. Among our ranks, you’ll find former teachers and lawyers, soldiers and financial analysts. We are bound together by our creativity, our analytical abilities, our problem-solving skills, and the grit needed to get things done.""

Look fellow retards; I've been on the front lines of the Epic Systems deployment teams, and I know this model works. It's arguably the best deployment model out there. Palantir will succeed beyond your wildest dreams. Others have said it, but this company is poised to be the next largest market share enterprise software solution you've never heard of. Get on on the train.

The early morning action was unremarkable considering events of the last week. Ground was taken and lost between Cohen's Cohorts in the 80th and the battle hardened 95th. This is ground that has been fought over time and again, and I hope to never see it again for the remainder of my days.

**9:30 AM - 12:30 PM**

I fear I have asked too much of my men. They have already proved their worth to me a thousand times over and then a thousand again, but still I ask them to push. Ground continues to be taken and lost in an endless circle over the same bloody ground. Privately, I despair for the men of the 159th Weaponized Autists that were left stranded and wanting for reinforcements in yesterday's fighting. Every ounce of my strength is now focused on their safe return. Privately, I despair.

**12:30 PM - 1:00 PM**

Operation FD has been launched. The men of the 100th in conjunction with elite troops from the 101st Asperger's Airborne have launched a coordinated blitz assault. Pray for us.

**1:00 PM - 2:30 PM**

The enemy has been taken completely unawares. We're seeing men feared lost from the 110th and 120th trickle back to camp. Decisive gains have been made across the line. Each time we visit, enemy resolve weakens. I was a fool to have despaired. I know the men and women I fight with. The men of the 150th are fighting for their lives, but mark my words, we are coming.

**2:30 PM - 4:00 PM**

It is my pleasure to report that all stranded troops of the 120th, 130th and 140th have been joined, and despite their weariness continue to fight with a zeal that even the finest scribes known to man could not capture in words. As our troops massed alongside the 150th, General Left and his horde of crayons were seen retreating to ground that has not yet been contested. Fresh troops from the 200th have been brought up alongside elite ground units from Seal Team 160.

Tomorrow we ride to uncharted territory.

&#x200B;

edit: In a crushing blow to the enemy, Seal Team 160 obliterated all resistance in it's path. Troops are being rushed in from the 200th, 210th and 220th. Even reserve troops from the 230th saw brief action. The day is ours."|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224330.csv|StockTicker

It was up roughly 50% to ~$225 in after hours.

In my opinion the short squeeze isn't over, but I think there will be an avalanche down tomorrow at open with multiple trading halts.  People will likely sell at 200+.  I expect it to rise again after the bloodbath.

I am not scared.  I took my theta gains and put my spacesuit on.  I'm going to the fucking moon.  I've got salvos of trailing buy stop orders ready to be strike at a moment's notice at the drops.

Be smart if drops happen.  Have a plan, lie in wait, and pounce.

If you have the insane risk tolerance for this, I think it's worth it.  If it dips I'm buying calls at several steps and holding one of those until this stock goes nuclear.

Good luck in this anarchy.

The halts kept freezing Robinhood so I couldn’t buy OR Sell my shares.  Shares, not options, I couldn’t buy or sell shares, the orders wouldn’t fill....with shares. 

That’s fucked up and I want answers.  Are there any videos explaining the halts today?  Those halts today cost us massive profits on the way up and on the way down. Anybody trying to sell GME at $159 probably didn’t get their sell order accepted.  Anybody buying on the way up couldn’t get their buy orders filled.

[1min chart 1\/26](https://preview.redd.it/a113d7oniqd61.png?width=2544&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a1a2232148794466cca6b1395917cadb2f2a289)

&#x200B;

Day starts with a big gap-up to 95 that is immediately defended. Once again, the 95 price was pivot to the day. First half of the trading with lower than usual volume. The main highlight being the smashing the buy button at $80. Notice how fast and concentrated those candles go up. This is not retail chasing prices.

MMs defended the 95 level during the morning as borrowing fees increased to over 80%. This should tell you something about what was going on in the market. Low volume, short fee jumps, tactical buying moves at certain levels and tightening trading range. At noon, all hell breaks lose.   


Rising volume with rising prices once again, all the way to the other pivot point at $115: the highest open interest strike of 1/29. From here on, its an open highway to tendie town. 

&#x200B;

Unlike yesterday (and the days before), the people buying at this levels are not retailers nor MM hedging. I also don't think is much covering going on (yet). The volume and candles are flowing just on the limit of the circuit breakers as to not lose momentum. Once it starts reaching the 10% threshold, it decelerates ever so slightly as to keep the momentum and avoid trading halts. This is sophisticated.

&#x200B;

Tomorrow I'll be looking for consolidation points to accumulate. Keep tracking OI volumes and key pivot points. They will tell you what's going on.

Finally sucked it up and made an account recently. No clue what karma is, but I’ve heard loss porn is treasured around these parts. I’m 23 and in school. Decided to “dip my toe” into investing, or let’s say “investing” at the worst (or best?) time last year, right before the vid and my autist tendencies took over. Tried a little bit of everything actually. Stocks, options, day trading one, then the other, then both at one point. Hopped on Papa Elon’s dick for a good while, lost it. Caught the Pfizer run up, lost it. Didn’t have much to play with on PLTR but tooled around with FDs, earnings on various shit, then played it “safer” with longs towards the end of the year. At times listened to wsb, at times reversed it. Had a few good spurts but ultimately lost bigly. Discipline was an issue at first, then just stupidity or bad luck I guess. Figured life is a learning game? Backed out for a while and withdrew my pitiful gains for December. Taxes are gonna fuck me over. Not total devastation but a big hit. The worst part is I really enjoyed this hobby or lifestyle to be honest. Believe it or not, it was getting me into better habits of at least waking up earlier, exercising more regularly, etc. Anyway, as much as you may love this chart, I’m slightly down in the dumps about last year if we’re being real, all things considered. No cause for alarm, and yes I’ve already talked with a few people about the experience. Not looking for handouts but more so just advice and conversation. I’d like to get back into it, but too chicken shit I suppose without somewhat of a better plan. These GME posts get me hard, give me hope, but we know how it goes sometimes. Best plan is to have no plan? Yolo? Idk. I’ll be online for a while tonight. Thanks fellas, and win big tomorrow for all of us.

**Retail does not want to be manipulated anymore.**

For decades Wall Street was manipulating securities, getting away with it, and blaming it on others. Through the media, bullshit target prices, naked short selling, or other forms of manipulation mentioned [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_manipulation) (Kenneth, [this one](https://www.ft.com/content/16cee174-3b7f-11ea-b232-000f4477fbca)'s for you). Citadel and many other MMs - don't misinterpret with Market Makers, we're talking about Market Manipulators here - got away with their dirty tactics to make shitload of money and screw people over. They finally got caught in their own game and tried everything to turn it around, but Shitron didn't work, the media didn't work, more aggressive selling didn't work. Now they're calling through some random crooks for regulations.

**BULLSHIT.** Regulation for what? Exchange of ideas? Our own Due Diligence? Winning against you in your own game? Yeah, in most cases your buddies at the SEC would gladly do so if you tell them anyway. This time though? People finally came to the realisation what the fuck you guys are doing over there. It was known by many since 2008 but people forgot quickly, and now is the time to remind them that you are no one else's friend but your crooked buddies.

I never thought I'd say this, but this community showed more leadership and guidance than any other media network. Providing knowledge, research, answers, many of you proven that **you are better people** than these fuckers with billions of dollars of AUM. You should be proud of yourselves as you are leading an unprecedented event in the history of finance. **Unprecedented.** This is why you should still guide others and be an example. Of course, we are not an entity and we will never be - just remember that you are a part of something great, maybe something that will change the way financial world operates, in a smaller or larger way. Remember that there are sharks among us who got pissed at the dirty games as well (shoutout to you Elon & Chamath). We are not alone.

They blame us? Let's blame them. They will lose all credibility sooner than later, not to mention this incoming generation. The media is here now, you still might convince my 80-year old grandpa that the internet is something out of Pandora's Box, but soon enough you won't be able to convince a single person. We are an important source of information for many people, and I'm not talking about WSB, but about the people that make it. Let's go there in the world and spread the facts.

Hence, dear Market Manipulators:

***Do not mislead again. Do not manipulate again. Get your facts straight. Retail matters, and you will see it.*** "|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224330.csv|StockTicker

Someone bought around 6000 calls of FUBO 42 strike and then others joined in on the 43 strike. FUBO is a highly shorted stock but one of the main shorts is Kerrisdale Capital, an underperforming fund that is not highly regarded on wall street. Another short seller is Lightshed. Both are probably still in this position even though FUBO actually has long term prospects as a valuable company. 

&#x200B;

As opposed to Melvin Capital that is somewhat well respected on the street (not sure given how retarded they are for going against WSB), these guys are actually full blown retarded even by wall street standards. They've been underperforming heavily and none of the firms are ever gonna step in to save them. 

I think we'll see a heavy short squeeze because these calls are massive. They bought 6000 calls at around 3 premium so that's around 1.8 million in premium paid. You don't put on a bet like that on weeklies unless you want to cause some major pain towards the short selling firm. This is a big ass trade intended to kill.

I’m an avid lurker on WSB and have been keenly following the GME saga. Although I haven’t actually gone around to putting any skin in the game myself due to my employment trading restrictions, I had a thought if it’s not already being actively employed, which it may very well be. 

GME is up 600%+ YTD and yet the short interest still remains 138%+ of float. The short squeeze that everyone is fighting for hasn’t actually happened or even started yet. The shorts who have gotten squeezed out have been quickly replaced by even more new shorts. There have been articles stating the short interest is even higher today than it was last week. So my question becomes, where the fuck are the shorts getting so much borrow from? Who is lending them all these shares? Now, anyone who uses a margin account basically agrees to have their broker lend your shares on their behalf anytime. You have to explicitly stop your broker from lending out your shares. I’m sure most of you know this, but I just wanted to flag so people can be actively aware that they can stop their shares from being lent out to shorts which may help bring on the squeeze. Who knows what percentage of float the WSB community is lending to these shorts but it must be meaningful I’m sure. Hell if Cohen with his 12.9% stake pulled any borrow I’m sure he could singlehandedly catalyze the real squeeze. 

EDIT: as per comments below, having GTC sell limit orders apparently does NOT stop your broker from lending out your shares. You’ll have to contact the broker and probably have to have an all cash account (?). Most of you guys aren’t using margin for GME anyways so hopefully there’s a real way for the majority here to stop their shares from being lent out. https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-putting-a-high-limit-sell-order-will-prevent-shorts-from-borrowing-your-shares

Everyone should be calling their brokers to find out how and if they can stop their shares from being lent out. At this point, it’s worth the time putting in the call. 

I’m just a guy who wants to see the squeeze actually happen and see what price GME can reach when the squeeze is done. As of right now it seems like both sides are going strong and the shorts aren’t backing down so you need all the tricks up your sleeve you can get.

I think it's important to see how the sentiment is getting manipulated from outside actors trying to spread FUD- fear, uncertainty, doubt.



1) The most obvious and harmless kind of sentiment-manipulation happens via newspapers and the TV. It's what you'd expect Boomers to write about us. Not accurate at all and probably done out of favor for Hedgefund friends, but also having a very limited effect in times of Reddit, Facebook and Youtube.



2)The weirder part is how sentiment is manipulated on WSB itself. Low karma accounts spreading some kind of hype around low-energy stocks in this subreddit and other stock related subreddits, trying to divert attention. It's not far fetched at all that some of these are hired actors (if I was a billionaire with tons to lose, I'd invest in people trying to divert attention from the hype stock). There's also some ""shouldn't we sell here? Is it really going higher?"" Posts that just feel **off**, like written by someone that isn't molded by WSB lingo. Like by an outsider.



3)Price action. Obviously price action is manipulated to make you doubt yourself and to suppress the price. For this, short spikes that get sold off rapidly is to be expected, because it increases the readiness to take profits at the ""next"" spike. I think that is what we saw yesterday 




What can you do against this?

First; BE AWARE THAT IT IS HAPPENING. Then you can ignore it.


Second; read DD posts and make rational decisions.


Third; Set a price target and stick to it. Don't try to play the swings, instead just buy&hold for your PT.


Fourth; downvote & report shills, share this post to increase awareness about the manipulation and spread positive sentiment if you are bullish. With this I don't mean tons of 🚀🚀🚀 or ""1000 is not a meme"" (it is, kind of).

I mean you should comment your legit bull thesis as an answer to FUD.

Last week I had 10k to my name. Come Friday I lost another grand bringing my portfolio down to 9k in total. I had a full week of bleeding value from 26k due to holding tesla calls hoping that there'd be an earnings run-up. Then on Friday I decided I had had enough. I knew Gamestop was doing well and it was sitting around 35 dollars so I figured why not? I threw 7 thousand dollars at it between calls dating for 1/22-1/29 with the highest one being about a $60 strike. Then came 10am Friday morning 1/22.

Gamestop shot up an astronomical amount breaching over 100% at one point. This sent my account flying. First 20k, then 30, then 40 and 50. It finally settled around 36k for the day for a whopping 29 thousand dollar gain for the day. I couldn't believe it!

Come Monday (yesterday) I bought even more shares and even more calls. I bought expirations of 1/29-2/5 calls with strikes ranging from 75-130. This drove my account up even further. I opened Monday at 63k, from there it quickly rushes and topped around 170k for a huge 300% 110k gain for the day. I didn't sell though. Then came the halts. The stock quickly fell all the way from 155 down to 60/share. I had gone from 170k to 12k in an instant. But I wasn't discouraged. When the halt ended I was stressed but I wasn't going to be discouraged. I bought only a couple more shares and held through the volatility. My account closed yesterday at 58k - I was down from the morning open but up on the day.

Now we are at the present. My account climbed from from 58k from yesterdays close to 72k at open this morning. I knew what kind of day I was in for from yesterdays events but this time I was ready. I would not paper hand and I would not miss the rocket! I clutched onto my calls and I held on tight to my shares. My account closed today at a new high of 143 thousand dollars. I sold my calls dated for this coming Friday (1/29) to secure some cash. I withdrew 10 thousand and the other 35k I will use to gather more shares. 

I'm not going to sit here and pretend I'm some sort of marketing genius. At the end of the day I got very lucky and timed my play right before rush. 

Gamestop was a place I spent a lot of time growing at growing up. They were my favorite place to buy games from! They may have only offered me 20 cents in-store credit for my old Xbox 360 and a handful of games. But what they didn't tell me is that one day they'd give me far more than that. Today Gamestop paid for my college tuition for the remaining 3 years I have in college. Thank you Gamestop. And thank you everyone here. I love you all."|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224332.csv|StockTicker

Honestly this felt like a demo webinar that also could've just been posted on their youtube channel for everyone to see.

The positive: it was great. I don't think I've learned anything new other than confirmations on how powerful their said features are and incredibly smooth their UX is.

The negative: their presentation obviously wasn't catered to stock market investors (felt more like a sales pitch). They didn't boast any new numbers or clients, which probably explains the after-hours price action. Also, their roadmap wasn't really demo'd. They just explained with words on what they plan on doing (again, if true, very cool but would've been compelling if they had clips supporting the roadmap as well).

My takeaway: just confirmation bias for long term holders that Palantir has great, premium products. Great insight on their tech but it was a hyped event that doesn't help the stock short term like tomorrow.

What are your thoughts?

**Topgolf Acquisition**

Topgolf was acquired in an all share purchase value at 2 Billion in October 2020.

Topgolf will issue 2 Billion worth of shares once the merger is approved in early 2021.

(69 Million shares or a 73% increase in float based on current levels)

Topgolf was in talks with multiple banks for an IPO in January 2020 valued at 4 Billion prior to the pandemic. [https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/callaways-topgolf-acquisition-is-a-risky-bet-amid-the-pandemic-191136062.html](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/callaways-topgolf-acquisition-is-a-risky-bet-amid-the-pandemic-191136062.html)

If top golf were to have been listed via IPO it could have easily fetched upwards of 6 Billion + with the recent IPO craze and explosion of growth in golf.

Callaway Golf landed Topgolf at a steal of a price with this 2 Billion dollar acquisition and the current stock price is undervalued based on this alone.

Callaway's market cap after merger will be 4.5 Billion assuming shares issued are based on today's price. ((94+69)\*$28)

The combined company of Callaway and Topgolf is going for less than what Topgolf would of ipo'ed for alone.

Callaway all share transaction will prove beneficial for the company as it utilizes its cash for Topgolf expansion throughout 2021

**Topgolf Breakdown**

Topgolf's 2019 revenues exceeded $1.1 Billion

Topgolf has been growing at a annual Compound Growth Rate = 30%

There are currently 63 locations across the world, up from 51 in 2018

Top golf served over 23 million guests in 2019, with 50% of consumers identifying as non-golfers

Top Golf owns TopTracer - Top Tracer is a leading ball tracing technology that has been purchased and deployed by over 7,500 range bays in the last 3 years. Callaway is looking to install Top Tracer in over 8,000 bays in 2021 and 8,000 annually on a goforward basis.

World Golf Tour - Leading mobile golf game with over 28 million members as of 2019, helping to attract newcomers to the sport

**Growth**

Topgolf is in the early stages of its growth with more than ten years of planned unit growth opportunity in its U.S. venues business and just 2% addressable market penetration in international venues and 1% in the TopTracer Range business. The company has a proven ability to innovate to expand its addressable market and capture the potential of games and content on its interconnected platform.

**Topgolf 2021 Expansion**

In the last 3 months 7 new venues have begun construction, which represents a 11% increase in total venues. Callaway has stated that they will look to expand rapidly with new Top Golf venues post merger. (Hence why they opted to do a share transaction rather then a mix to fund expansion) To put this in perspective, Top Golf only opened 9 venues in the 12 months prior to the merger. They have almost reached their prior years venue growth in the first 3 months post merger.

Top Golf is on track to open 20+ venues in the next 18 months which would represent a 31% increase in venues since merger. Many of these locations will be international, Asia, Dubai, Germany to capitalize on the untapped markets overseas.

**Merger Synergies**

**Brands:**

Callaway's products Ogio, TravisMathew and JackWolfskin brands will be promoted at Top golf locations and will strengthen Callaway's brands. There will be significant growth in merchandise sales and club sales as a result of this merger.

**Used Clubs**

Callaway buys back old sets of clubs from their customers, giving them a credit towards new sets of clubs, and sends/sells the old clubs to be used at Topgolf. This integration will significantly increase the bottom line of Topgolf as they no longer have to purchase clubs from third parties at a premium.

28 million guests that come through the doors each year will have a chance to test out used Callaway clubs. Over 50% of which are newcomers who will most likely opt to purchase the same used brand that they learned on/used at Topgolf. Existing golfers may look to switch their club set to Callaway if they see an improvement in their distance/accuracy. (any golfer knows that you always hit better at the driving range than on the course)

**Overall Market Growth**

The total number of rounds played in the US increased about 12 percent from 2019. This may not seem like a lot but considering that most courses were shut down until June, this growth in the late summer/fall was the largest growth since the Tiger Craze in 1996.

November Play Jumps 57% to Set New Record Rise for 2020 [https://www.thengfq.com/covid-19/](https://www.thengfq.com/covid-19/)

October Play was up 32.2 percent over the same month in 2019.

That followed increases of approximately 14 percent in June, 20 percent in July, 21 percent in August and 26 percent in September.

NGF research shows the number of golfers ages 6 to 17 rose by as much as 20 percent this year. The number of newcomers is close to an all-time high, as is latent demand.

Juniors (6-17) and young adults (18-34) comprise about 35% of all on-course golfers

[https://www.thengfq.com/2020/04/2020-golf-industry-report-available-to-members/](https://www.thengfq.com/2020/04/2020-golf-industry-report-available-to-members/)

Growth in the market means more people buying clubs, and more golfers attending Topgolf during the offseason or their leisure.

**Newcomer Growth and Callaway's Q4 Earnings**

There has been an explosion in growth of newcomers golfing in 2020 thanks to the pandemic. Many of which went their first seasons using used clubs and hand me downs from friends. You can bet your mom’s Vicodin that Callaway is going to see a surge in their boxing day sales/black Friday sales as newcomers look to purchase new sets of clubs for their first time. In my group of friends alone we went from having 8 buddies in our regular golf group to over 30 thanks to the pandemic. The first thing most of them did after the golf season ended was purchase a new set of clubs. I am expecting a large beat for Q4 revenues with revenues of $390M+ which would represent a 25% increase from Q42019 and 16% revenue beat on estimates thanks to the influx of first year golfers looking to upgrade their used clubs.

**Callaway's Future**

Callaway has transformed from a small, profitable slow growing company to a large, high growth company and should be valued as such. The next couple years Callaway will be key as they continue to open new venues across the globe and integrate Callaway products in venues. Revenues will grow from $1.75 billion in 2020 to $3.5 Billion + in 2021, and expected annual revenue growth at 25%+ for the foreseeable future. If plans are executed properly and debt is managed Callaway is on track to exceed 7 Billion in Sales by 2025 as Topgolf continues to expand internationally as they currently only have 2% of the addressable market.

**Price Target and Valuation**

Price Target raise to $40 from Jefferies [**https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3230379&headline=ELY-Callaway-Golf-price-target-raised-to--from--at-Jefferies**](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3230379&headline=ELY-Callaway-Golf-price-target-raised-to--from--at-Jefferies)

**Price to Sales**

2021 FY Revenue Forecast: $3.6B Topgolf 1.5B (30% CAGR) + Callaway 2.1B

= 28.95/(3,600,000,000/163,000,000)

ELY P/S = 1.31

GOLF P/S = 1.96

ELY P/S Fair Value = $43.31 (28.95\*(1.96/1.31)

This P/S is compared to GOLF which has stagnant revenue growth at 3% YoY growth.

ELY should be valued at a much higher multiple thanks to its 30% CAGR which would label it as a “growth company and should be valued as such”. Growth companies have price to sales ratios ranging between 5-15. ELY price target in the $100-$300 range long term using these multiples. Short term it will climb to above $43 to be inline with its peers and will run to above $100 over the next year once Topgolf revenues are reflected.

**Short Interest:**

Callaway historically trades on low volume, averaging 1.6M shares traded daily in January. The current short interest is 19.34% of the float or roughly 16.77 million shares. With the recent climb from $24 to $29 over the past month 1.3 million share sold short covered and closed their position. As $ELY continues to climb and when earnings beats in February shorts will cover and send the price up faster thanks to its wide spreads and relatively low volume.

**TLDR:**

Callaway purchased Topgolf at a fraction of the price it would of IPO’ed for thanks to the pandemic. Topgolf acquisition is undervalued, bringing in CAGR at 30% year over year and will experience growth exceeding 50% in 2021 thanks to Callaway's aggressive venue expansion plans. There are multiple synergies that will benefit both companies as a result of this merger (used clubs, merchandise sales at Topgolf) Callaway will beat their upcoming earnings report thanks to the growth in new golfers during the year. Callaway will triple from these levels over the next couple years and is currently undervalued compared to its peers.

**Position:**

02/19/2021 30C’s + 02/19/2021 35C's for earnings play will roll them into long term calls after ER.

01/20/2023 40C Long Term play

We saw call prices rocket 50-100% on Tuesday when it rallied 5%, calls have come down since then and are ready to be loaded."|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224332.csv|StockTicker

Will retail investors continue to squeeze out shorts? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a wild stock market, with the markets starting off in the green before having a drop in early morning trading but eventually finishing off with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/xhtxHrZ) gaining 0.69%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/6mykhfj) rising by .36% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/vDQsrLs) lost 37 points as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/tMyRKvN) rose by almost 6% and was even over 26 at one point.

We finished the day with 55% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/SvJnHLr) declining on average volume with the number of companies above the moving averages remaining pretty much the same as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/zVkwnQK) actually finished in the green, with Utilities and Consumer Staples leading the way while Energy was the biggest laggard, dropping just over 1%, but recovered from the lows of the day.

Large-Cap Growth Companies were [outperforming](https://ibb.co/8sM97kV) the markets while the rest of the groups were underperforming as big tech managed to stay positive through the lows as you can also see in yesterday’s [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/JKNzC7f), with Apple, Microsoft & Tesla leading the way, while Banks & Industrials joined the Energy sector in losing ground.

[Today](https://ibb.co/hdnyZsJ) we start the day off with Redbook chain store sales, the Shiller Home Index, Consumer Confidence and a lot of earnings reports from the likes of JNJ, 3M, as we also have [possible](https://ibb.co/9T4w2f0) volatility in Li Auto, GE, Freeport and Plug Power, before the big tech earnings start to trickle in after-hours with AMD, Microsoft & Starbucks

I’ll be watching to see what JNJ may announce on their vaccine progress while AMD will be under the spotlight to see if they manage to continue to take market share from Intel.

In some other stock market news, we continued to see small stocks having a wild ride, as the battle of the short’s vs WSB continues. This has become a major battle with multiple heavily shorted stocks gaining massive in the last days & weeks.

And though I don’t encourage anyone to seek such high and fast returns, these events can last long enough to break the short-sellers as this event can keep on going for an unknown period of time before the fundamentals of the company retake center stage, so don’t try and fight the market, if you don’t seek high volatility, it’s just better to avoid getting to much exposure to these names.

You should seek long-term capital gains, as you can see [here](https://ibb.co/x3Zhjx5), the probability of you having negative return keeps getting lower and lower the longer your time horizon gets. You can just gamble and have a 54% chance of having a positive gain in any random day, but as you move the time-frame along, that chance goes to 94% if you invest for 10years which is pretty much as safe as you can get in money investment, as staying invested is the best way to go, just look at this [chart](https://ibb.co/ssgvs70) through March, staying invested had turned 1$ into over 15$ in under 30 years, while missing the 25 best days only managed a return of about 5$. But missing both the best & worst 25 days did have a higher return, though timing the market is nearly impossible as markets can act irrational for a very long time and you might start to wonder when is the actual [time](https://ibb.co/28z6hTZ) to sell or buy, while in reality, no one knows what the markets will do in the short-term and trying to predict that is pure speculation and a waste of time that could be used for long-term investing.

You can also see that there isn’t any political effect usually to [investing](https://ibb.co/mD6kQ5s), as the probability of the stock market rising in any year doesn’t depend that much on what is the year of the term of the current president, though you can see a slightly bigger chance in the first year of a Presidential term.

And one last thing I wanted to talk about is the type of [assets](https://ibb.co/ysw2yQn) I think are best suited for the current situation. As you can see the SP500 has largely outperformed most other asset classes, but I think this might change this year, with small-caps being more exposed to an improving economy and international stocks benefiting from further QE easing in the US, which will make the dollar weaker, thus increasing the returns you can get in international stocks.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/1vsT3vM) are pointing to flattish open, with the Dow Jones leading the way.

This is based off the closest strike price of 150 at the close and the pricing of puts and calls for this level.

Market makers are not pricing GME to go above 220.58  or below 79.50 by the 29th Jan. Above or below those amounts they will start to loose against the options they sold and will need to either defend that level or join the buying to hedge.

***In the US today, investment in digital 2015 -> 2020 increases from 45% to 55%. Physical from 2015 -> 2020 drop 55% -> 45%***

&#x200B;

**Introduction**

1.	First we all know about Palihapitiya (the man behind Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (SPCE) )

The success of previous merges is undeniable. We have OpenDoor, and Virgin Galactic. All of them are Skyrocket. . . except Clover Health. 

  

2.	Back to Sofi, Anyone here using Sofi? This app is very good, the interface is nice and they are one of the famous lenders. 

Not only that, they also integrate many useful learning programs. Sofi also teaches you investing (forget it, this part is trash. We all know WSB is the best forum.) 

Sofi

MIN. CREDIT SCORE 680 / EST. **APR 5.99 - 20.69% / LOAN AMOUNT** $5,000 - $100,000

&#x200B;

***What does this mean?***

Above **680** means you good, you gucci. **5.99 \~ 20.69%** will be the est profit **per year** (At least). Depends on an investment of $ 5000 - $ 100,000.

So why not use SoFi money to invest in itself?

&#x200B;

Note: if you intend to the moon with 100k, why not open LLC trade account? Prepare for Bk7 without lose any shares.

**Intrinsic value**

1.	Look at Opendoor, look at Virgin Galactic. What do you see?

I see SPCE: $ 10 - $ 7 - $ 15 - $ 33 in 5 months. That's **200%** increase, but a COVID cause . . . now it is back to the top at 38 $.

OpenDoor **170%**

&#x200B;

2.	So what is the value of Sofi this place?

Sofi is not a company like Virgin Galactic, Opendoor. Sofi already has a number of potential customers of her own.

Some guys at CNBC said ""Well, Covid happened. The house price is quite cheap, but it's difficult to borrow through traditional banks. I borrowed Sofi, I also have Student loan from Sofi""

&#x200B;

**What does this mean?**

After researching a few articles later, I discovered this bastard invested in Sofi through a private fund.

Conclusion: This guy borrowed money from Sofi to invest in Sofi. Very smart !!

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

&#x200B;

Right now, IPOE costs around 21 \~ 22. Pretty cheap, IPOE and Sofi have official confirmation of merge. The est time is around Q1 2021. Documents on this clause can be found at Webull (it's free).

**IPOE** current price **20.48**, **SPACE** current price **36**, **OPEN** current price **27.33**. 

**Hints:** Lender **upstart** has poor interface. Fewer customers than Sofi. **Upstart** current price **67.36** (up **300+%**). Upstart doesn't qualify for banking, but Sofi has."|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224332.csv|StockTicker

Now that Melvin is bankrupt, their position goes to their broker which are the big banks. Now, the banks want to close the position, but there are no paper hands in GME. They want to pay up, with Melvin money but there is none.

They can't even liquidate Melvin long portfolio and pay for their grim mistakes, a sacrifice offering not available.

So here is the problem, we can't win against the banks. If we are winning against the bank, our big boys in GME will get a talk with big brother.

Now if you read my post history you will find out that I am permabull holding $BB shares from $3 to $20. This is not why I am writing this DD on 🚀GME🚀, no, full stop. I want 🚀GME🚀 brothers to go to one trillion dollars, because I know at the end of the day some of that will come to the deep value play of $BB.

The issue is if the banks who are soon forced to hold bankrupt short position cannot cover because of  💎🤚  =   🚀   🚀   🚀 . Then there is a big problem, now the problem is not big right now since the market cap is only 10B on   🚀 GME  🚀 , but lets say we 10x again and head to 100B, one trillion, then this will bring down big banks.

To this day last year my ex broke up with me, moved out the flat and was AirBnB'ing on a Nigerian families' sofa, today has marked the 365 day turnaround and we still have three days left of the week!!!!

Not selling until at least $500 per share.... or $1000!?!?!

However I have taken profits here on SPWR and going to re enter my positions tomorrow.

Current Positions:

SPWR 2/19 $60c

SOL 2/19 $30c

BLDP 2/19 $45c

SPCE 2/5 $50c

I think Solar is going to keep booming and SPWR is extremely shorted and can keep booming. My target is still $60 (check my last post) but i think we can hit over $100 in a few months.

Look into Renesola or $SOL they just did a offering to a bank of a quarter billion dollars today which put the stock on sale. This is on top of recently paying off all of their debt and starting a venture into Europe of 1GW of energy this year. (1GW is worth 1 billion dollars alone) it’s a steal at this price. It dropped from $35 to $25 today and will soon be in the $40-$50 range as it makes it way to $100. That would give it a 5 billion dollar market cap or for comparisons sake 1/5th of Enphase market cap (ENPH) when they make about 1/2 the revenue yearly. It’s a HEAVILY underpriced stock and will PRINT. Congrats if you get in.

If you’re wondering why it went down, They did a $250 million shelf offering to a bank. That tanked the price. It will be over after the 27th. Same thing happened at the $40 million offering 2 weeks ago it went from $21 to $16 then back up once the offering was done. Big boys are getting in. I think this will be a $100 stock at a minimum here soon. That $40 million wiped out the last of their debt they’d been paying off the past decade or so ($1 billion) and they’re now a clean green well running machine.

Positions: 200 shares and 12 July $20 LEAPS

I would buy shares or leaps with this and just watch it grow.

I honestly have moved on since then, and didn’t really understand 100% of how it all broke down, and plus that was a long time ago, so let’s start with a clean slate scenario:

* Let’s say I earn 1000 giving hand-jobs near the dumpster behind Wendy's, and put it in my brokerage acct.
* At this point, I have earned 1000.
* I buy Stonk ABC, and the value doubles. I sell one week later, and now have $2000. I take that money out and hold it in my hand, rub it on my face, put it in my pants, etc.
* This year, I have earned $2000. So far, so good.
* Now I take the 2,000, put it BACK in my brokerage, and yolo that 2,000 into Stonk DEF. It moons, and I now have 10,000 in my brokerage. I withdraw that money, hold it in my hand, and rub it on my wife's BF’s pecs as he hits wifey from behind.

**At this point I have made… what? Is it 10,000? Or is it 12,000?** I earned 2,000 *earlier* (and rubbed it on my face, put it in my pants), then put it BACK INTO the brokerage, and then pulled it out again as (a new?) 10,000.

Does that 10,000 add to the 2,000 I made earlier, or is the IRS aware that the 2,000 ***went back in*** and only 8,000 NEW money came back out? This is honestly where I think I got fucked a few years back.

TurboTax was telling me my earnings were way higher than any total I ever had available to throw on my floor and roll around in, and I wasn’t sure if it was like “you made 2000, then (like a fucking idiot) you put it back in the casino and bought 2,000 worth of chips (which we think is stupid, but hey, you do you), then one week later left the casino with a new 10,000 that we never saw before”.

I think since I was moving money out of FailBase and into WellsFucko, they added up all the extractions, without taking the “take profits, buy dip, sell peak, take profits, buy next dip, sell next peak” into consideration. Yes I ended up above where I started, but MINUS the parts that went back in, that number was way smaller that what they saw. All they saw was “Sell, Sell, Sell, those all add up to $fuckyou,payme.00”, essentially ignoring the “and then I buy back in”.

Now I use an actual brokerage, and see there are unrealized gains, etc, but it’s taking the Buy and Sell portions into effect, and saying “you’re UP this portion *overall*”.

Am I retarded? It seems pretty straightforward, but last time I did this I kinda got fucked.

**Business Overview**

Berry Global (BERY) is a technology and engineering company involved in the manufacturing of plastics packaging for consumer, healthcare, and industrial end-markets. They are a low cast manufacturer with 70% of sales in stable, consumer oriented end-markets. They have ~$12B of revenue and $2.2B of EBITDA. They make over 100,000 items including masks, bottles, cups, wipes, films, and many others. And yes, this Berry is “OG”, was founded before BB.

BERY has the potential to double or triple over the next year with fairly low downside risk in the stock.


🚀🚀🚀 📈 📈 📈🌛 🌛 🌛

**Bull Case:**

* Strong Free Cash Flow
   *  More than $1b of normalized free cash flow generation on °$7b market cap. Guidance of $875-$975m in 21 with some excess cash flow.
   * Trades at like a 14-15% FCF yield vs. packaging comps trading at 6-7%, implying stock can double. FCF yields this high at time when Treasury rates at historical lows.

* Good growth for the industry 
   * Grew 4% in most September quarter and solid growth expected to continue.
   * Plastics are not going away and are actually growing.
* Cheap vs. Competitors
   * Trades at ~7.6x EV/EBITDA vs. its closest competitor Amcor trading at ~11.5-12x.  (BERY is #2 and Amcor is #1 in plastic packaging with Berry being very close behind in size)
   * Small private transactions in the plastic packaging space on lower quality businesses have been in high single-digit context to low to mid-double digit context (10x+)
   * Stock more than doubles if it closes the valuation gap.
* Will start giving $ to Bulls this year
   * Company expects to start dividend/buybacks sometime in 21 after reaching its leverage target.
* Global leadership position with scale
   * 2nd largest plastics producers (~90%+ of biggest) and more double the third largest.
* Strong sustainability thesis
   * Plastic is actually better for the environment in terms of water usage, greenhouse gas emissions, solid waste, and energy than other items
* Leverage going down. Expects to reach 3.8-3.9x by September 2021
   * Should be able to start share buybacks/dividends to give cash to holders this year in 2021.
* Good acquisition history and consolidation opportunity
   * Strong track record of completing acquisitions and getting good synergies to make shareholder value.
   * BERY can continue to acquire small names and get cost-synergies, creating value.
* Not very well known	
   * Stock 98% held by 🌈 institutional boomers. Huge opportunity as it becomes more well known
* Downside Limited
   * Stock pretty fundamentally cheap even if bull case doesn’t play. Even in “worst case”, hard to see this stock down more than 20% vs. current levels ex another great depression.  Downside is limited given the defensive industry and strong cash generation and ability of the company repurchase stocks beginning this year if the stock begins too cheap.
   * Pandemic also good for this stock as it makes masks.

🌈 🐻 🐻 🐻

**Bear Case:**

* Boring/Boomer  Stock
   * Stock is not currently sexy and is in a “boring” industry compared to EVs and traditional technology
* Low short Interest
   * Short interest less than 3% of the float so a short-squeeze is not an upside/thesis
* “High” leverage
   * Levered ~4.4x, currently, which is higher than other blue-chip names
* Plastic Risk
   * Boomer 🌈 🐻‘s are worried about plastics going away, even though they’re not and growing. Business needs to show good organic growth to get rid of this fear.
* Raw material volatility
   * Company has to pass-through raw material changes to customers, which can cause short-term volatility. However company has strong pass-through mechanism and history doing it.

Key Catalysts:
* Earnings- Q4 Earnings Friday Feb 5th and Q1 earnings sometime in May.
   * Key question for earnings is continued organic growth of the business. Continued demonstration of growth allows this business to re-rate higher.
* Berry hitting 4x leverage and announcing either share buybacks or a dividend. Predict this to occur in mid 2021
   * Lower leverage and announcement of capital return may allow this business to re-rate higher.

🚀🚀 📈 📈 🌛 🌛

**Prediction:**

I believe the stock offers strong upside in the highest probability base and bull case scenarios with limited downside in the bear case scenario.	

**Base Case Scenario:** Berry de-levers throughout this year to 4x or less and reports continued strong organic growth, partially helped by growth in their health-sector (BERY sells masks) and the industrial recovery when it occurs later in the year. They announce capital return to equity shareholders as well. The combination of these factors causes the business to re-rate closer to Amcor to ~10x EV/EBITDA or an 8% FCF yield in my base case. This leaves the stock at $100 in base case (roughly a double).

**Bull Case Scenario:** is this re-rates along with the market and 🌈 🐻  boomers realizing plastic continues to grow, allowing both it and its plastics comps to re-rate closer to the 13x-15x EV/EBITDA range, putting you at  a $150-$180 stock price target (making this potentially a triple). This is probably less likely in the short-term (next 1 year, but can occur if investing with a multi-year timeline)

🌈 🐻  **Case Scenario:** Stock De-rates to 6.5x EV/EBITDA with soft organic growth , 16-18% FCF yield with a stock price of ~$43. Stock stays dirt cheap and is priced like plastics will not exist after 2026. I find this unlikely and this is only ~15% downside vs. today’s price.

First off Chamath Palipitiya has meme god status coming to him. We all know it.

Earlier this month renowned billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya brought Clover Health public through a SPAC. This was part of his SPAC series which he plans to revolutionize funding to companies. Clover Health is poised to change the way we see healthcare because of their use of Artificial Intelligence. They plan to use AI to discover high risk patients before complications arise to provide them with the best care possible. Sort of like Precogs from the minority report.

Father Chamath believes there are many things that make CLOV special. The main one being that it is undervalues Chamath has said that he believes the valuation to lie between 20-30 billion dollars while it is currently in the few billion stage. He likened it to Virgin Galactics SPCE. This is because people weren't able to grasp the concept of space travel going mainstream, he says the same realization is bound to hit Clover Health. This company is more of a technology company which allows it gain a great amount of investor support and funding. One of these investors which backed the startup was Alphabet - ""Google"".

Financials wise CLOV is still kicking ass. Clover was able to increase their revenue to close to 50%  in the past year. The IPO has only given it more money to increase infrastructure across America. They are currently located in 7 states of which 34 counties are effectively taken over. This allows the company a huge rate and area of growth to flesh into. 

As always do your own DD before hoping aboard.

(before reading, note that they are reporting earnings on the morning of the 26th, I will be taking advantage of the IV crush to open a LEAP position)

To start, I see an awful amount of praise for ETF's when playing this sector. However, while ETF's offer greater security in individual investments, the true risk and reward of playing this sector becomes apparent through the lens of comparison. The three ETF's I concentrated on for this DD are:

* **ICLN**
* **TAN**
* **FAN**

While these are all popular, none of them have weighted NEE anywhere near its capitalization potential. Just the next two years alone will nearly certainly double the stock's market cap. They have over $50B in infrastructure investments planned through 2022, and you can be assured that they will have an advantage to this [in the form of tax credits and subsidies.](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/nee-stock-is-ready-to-soar-under-green-biden-administration/)

That's right, Uncle Sam is going to skullfuck this company with tax credits and subsidies to the point that this thing could have a TSLA-esque potential. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, how does this company look when lined up among some competition?

The particular interest with NEE is that they seemingly do it all. This shit is like the Chic-Fil-A of the energy sector. It could honestly not give less of a shit about saving the world, its only focus is cash flow, which in terms that WSB is accustomed to, is just fuel reserves for its inevitable moon mission. I analyzed 3 different companies in the renewable energy sector, and those were

1. Plug Power
   1. slowing of net income in Q/Q growth.
2. Enphase
   1. already boomed. the party for this one got busted pretty fast. imo just a shitty boomer pick
3. First Solar
   1. This one is a legitimate competitor in my view. 
   2. I would honestly invest in this if its revenue sources were more diverse.

So taking these into account, NEE seems as if its obligatory duty is to take the throne of the renewable market (if you're for some reason doubting it even slightly)

# TLDR: EZ CASHFLOW, ECO-CONSCIOUS, and *bigly* expansion with tax credits incoming to help assist.

Vista Outdoor is the largest ammo maker in America with the acquisition of Remington's ammunition. As some of you know, ammo prices have gone exponential over the past year, with ammo prices going up 2-3x in some cases and continuing to climb higher. Currently, about 60% of VSTOs revenue is driven by ammunition, they own Federal, American Eagle, Remington (acquired in Nov) and Speer. VSTO currently has about 40% of the entire US ammunition market. Of the other major players, Hornady is private and Winchester is a smaller business segment of Olin. 


More:https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1d3qo/vsto_ammo_price_to_the_moon_safe_easy_24_bagger/ 


Price Target: Out of 10 analysts I checked out most of them have a median at around 34$ with a bear scenario of 28$ and bull sitting at little less than 40$. 


Revenue forecast: VSTO forecasts that the company will earn $2.48 per share for the year, up from their previous forecast of $2.14. At the current price we would get a 8,5% dividend. Such a rise in revenue is mostly due to Democrats taking over the oval office and people have started stocking up their inventory with ammo. There is also around 7mil new guns bought just this year and one of their ammo competitors closed down their business. They will not be increasing production rather than raising prices to fight the demand. This results in much higher margins and increased net profit. The same pathern happened last time when Obama was elected and right after Trump took over the stock started falling. Their last earnings were amazing and based on the comments I have seen people are stacking up even more now. Apperently ammo prices have gone way up in December (if you can confirm that I would appreciate it)


Disclamer: I own about 1000 shares since 22 and will add more if the price deeps today below 27$. I will be holding at least till 2.4. when they have their earnings report. "|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224333.csv|StockTicker

I’ll tell you now that $GME was and is a historical moment and I’d like to congratulate all who were part of it and still continue to be. For those who don’t really know why $GME has been rising so drastically; it’s because of its short interest. $GME had a short interest of 138%, more than double the percentage of the next most shorted stock in all of the market. $GME is not a company that’s going to succeed, it was merely a play to get gains off a short squeeze, but you already knew that. The squeeze can still continue and may continue to do so, however the awareness of WSB is growing larger and larger very quickly. Which means more people will want to start taking their profits, and some will even try to continue to short $GME. It could only continue to rise if people do NOT sell and only more shares are bought, which is unpredictable. Just know that $GME is something that happens once in a blue moon and we’ll be required to go back to our peasant 200% gains instead of 800%.

Which is why I’m here to give you the next best play, that focuses solely on predictability. Now it won’t cone as a surprise to say this ticker is $PLTR. I’m a longtime $PLTR holder but only because it proposes a huge opportunity if executed well, and slightly less significant opportunity if butchered. Either way, there’s opportunity.

IMPORTANT SECTION 🚀:
Lockup is coming very very quickly, upon lockup ending insiders will be able to sell their shares for the first time since the stock has been $10. The stock has more than tripled and there’s no doubt that tons of positions will be sold. Currently $PLTR has 20% of shares available to be publicly traded and of that percentage; majority is held by the general public or retail investors (us). The other 80% of shares are being held in lockup by insiders and cannot be traded publicly until lockup ends. If chunks of these shares are sold upon lockup ending, and general public happens to claim majority of the 80% too, then we control the stock entirely. The only way this is possible is if everyone literally buys anything they can with everything they can right upon lockup ending. 

TL;DR: General public needs to control majority shares when insiders are finally able to sell their positions when lockup ends. We currently own majority of the 20% that’s publicly available.

Positions: PLTR 800 shares @25.2

Listen up boys and girls, incoming brief DD for the queen, Lisa Su.

As some of the more astute of you may recall, AMD earnings is tonight after hours. Intel was last week, and we saw a modest bump for them. If AMD can simply show that they have gained market share, they will pop off. Analyst PTs are over $105, and there's no reason AMD can't reach that tonight.

**PC Market**

First, consider the market into which AMD is selling. The PC/GPU demand is rising for obvious reasons, with people working from home and spending more time on their computers. Further, gaming and mining create additional demand for their products.

However, demand won't be the issue for AMD, as their average graphics card is selling for >60% over MSRP aftermarket. This clearly means that capacity for AMD has and will continue to be an issue. They can show they resolved some capacity issues and expanded sales this way, which will lead to a bump. Regardless, there's a market for their offerings and their market share is expanding in both laptops and chromebooks.

**Sentiment**

As we've learned from some *other* recent price moves, ratios no longer mean a god damn thing. AMD's TEV/EBIT, TEV/EBITDA, and P/E is **significantly** higher than comps, but this isn't necessarily negative. They have been clawing for market share for years from these competitors and they're finally gaining. If they can show or even *project* an increase in market share, none of those ratios will cross anyone's mind when they slap the buy button. Frankly, $NVDA's ratios are pretty whack, too, but no one gives a shit because of the industry, and suddenly everyone is butthurt about AMD's ratios?

# Prelude

I own 100 shares. This is no advice to invest. Do your own DD.

*ignore the +100%. f´ing boomers sold this shit in premarket.*

# TLDR:

Company established a groundbreaking drug, Voclosporin. It has many benefits (more efficent, orally given, less side affects). They have the patent until 2037(!). The company expects 65K$ per patient - at least 200K patients in the US \* how many are actually treated = 1.3B $. They have 400M $ cash on hand + an aggreement for licensing the drug in Japan + EU for 100M $ + various milestone payments + 10-20% of revenue.

In total:

1.8B $ alone for the first year in the US, 1.3B $ is recurring revenue + 10-20% of revenue once EU/Japan approve the drug. Market cap? Only 2.3B $ Buyout? CEO and Chairman are open for it + have created comps which were bought out in the past by major pharm players.

enough DD was posted before, however the development of the share price shows the market does not evaluate this company at a fair price.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

# Establishing Voclosporin

SLE ( Systemic Lupus Ery. ) is an autoimmune disease. Various stages, various form. One of the worst is Lupus Nephrithis. In this form the functional units of the kidney, the nephrons, are attack by the bodies own immune system. The functions of the kidney fall off a cliff. Untreated the diagnosis is death.

[pretty shit to suffer from this](https://preview.redd.it/fgxut51hfmd61.png?width=1595&format=png&auto=webp&s=34e84cdf5ae2653cb1053711f60794d68bded1fe)

Current SoC / standard of care is the major use of steroids and using drugs to depress the immunesystem. This SoC is pretty shit as it is suboptimal and only helps few ppl improve. The target according to guidelines is:

*TLDR: decrease the secretion of protein*

Enter Voclosporin / Le blockbuster

It is a member of the Cyclosporin fam - so called calcineurin inhibitors. As I had to suffer through human physiology in this semster: they inhibite this molecule which turns on various immunological pathways.

[Major improvement over SoC](https://preview.redd.it/brjsgsd4hmd61.png?width=1589&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcac22951f0aa7192b12a03708876f93555a5aba)

3x as many patients benefit from this drug. But how good is it?

Very f´ing good fellow retard

With Voclosporin they are faster (only need 50% of the time), better, can be used on more classes of LN, can cut down on steroids and all it takes is a pill.

[Summary](https://preview.redd.it/pv3bwk6simd61.png?width=1591&format=png&auto=webp&s=eca3b153dc28f53de9c6a12f41fcfe3a7a609953)

Real nice - but how do they launch this thing in a pandemic?

They have been prepared for the liftoff. They boost a variety of people to influence all parameters of the equation: physicians, patients and insurance

# Tendies

The company owns the IP until 2037. This is incredibly bullish. Only one competitor exists: Benelysta by GSK (actually GSK bought the comp and did not develop it themself). They are inferior in every aspect + it´s not an orally given pill but and injection - yikes.

The *CEO was kinda retetarded* during the webcast yesterday. Well he had to be. So this part is a bit hard.

As LN is a rare disease the number of ppl affected is only roughly known. Therefore yesterday was kinda shit with the analysts as they were expecting a precise number on the revenue. The CEO was only able to provide the lower bound on the revenue.

https://preview.redd.it/brsuo5yrmmd61.png?width=1586&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cc001092a8a0c5e773f683b42169b4eeabe3503

AUPH provides patients with the pills package - called a wallet. This wallet contains around 60 pills. The patient takes 6 pills daily - i.e. this package lasts 10 days. Now here I´m a bit retarded BUT the CEO said they price the wallet to be 65K $ meaning a patient will receive the drug for 30 days will net the comp around 3x 65K. However the slides say 65K $ so I´ll leave it at that. => 65K $ per patient

Now, conservative estimates for the number of ppl suffering from LN is 200K - 300K. In my TLDR section I already did some math to figure out that the combination of those low estimates yields around 1.3B $ in revenue. 65K \* 200K \* actually treated patients = 1.3B

Add the 400M $ cash on hand + the licensing agreements and we have around 1.9B $ while the market cap is only 2.3B $. Once the real numbers and not just the low estimates are starting to pile up they will improve the share price.

This disease affects women and people from ""minority populations"" more often. These groups are the prime target of political actions taken by the progressive politicans.

Having this disease be common in those populations the real number of patients to be treated may be higher. On a humanitarian note, ""minority populations"" suffering from a disease and society not giving a damn is pretty bad."|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224333.csv|StockTicker

"" I am long on MARA at these price levels. Here is why:- The [Elliot wave](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/elliottwaves/) theory seems to be taking play here and it looks like we are about to start impulsive wave 5 after seeing corrective wave 4. Follow the patterns.- The [RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/relativestrengthindex/) is bottoming out (oversold), perfect conditions for the tide to turn after a steep correction.- We seem to be bouncing off the 1.618 FIB, which we must hold or I think we will break down to the .618 FIB and bottom resistance levels around $8.

Everything is not matching up perfectly on the chart, but damn near close. ""

*Processing img cs0jutxeipd61...*

I see an uptrend followed by a bull run and then the famous pennant. A pennant is a sign that there is a breakout impending. The fact that it is doing a pennant in an uptrend makes it a bullish pennant.

I am holding 200 shares with a BE of $6.86. PT is $28. I'll be looking to sell my shares and roll into buying weekly calls if it doesn't break out tomorrow.

Turning to their 10-Q you can see that they have had an 80% increase in consumer floral revenues for 20 Q3 as opposed to 19 Q3. Due to the gift baskets associated with the holidays, Q4 is always a strong quarter for them. However, with the masses-of-dead-people-whose-relatives-need-sympathy-flowers-to-believe-you-care revenue multiplier (1.8X), I think a healthy upside surprise could be in store. 

The consistent 1,000% of normal volume leading into this with most of the large orders for the 34c and up on the ask provides some confirmation.

They're currently undervalued verses their competitor ($ALGN) who owns Invisalign. SDC is no longer an only order-by-mail company as in January of 2020 they announced it would directly compete with $ALGN and start selling their aligners to dentists and orthodontists.

The pros of Smile Direct Club ($2000-$2800)

* Use an at-home impression kit to create a mould of teeth
* Send impressions to SDC
* Receive aligners and follow guide
* Check in with DIGITAL DENTIST every 90 days

vs Invisalign ($5000+)

* Visit dentist for assessment
* Dentist creates custom treatment plan
* Custom aligners are created
* REGULAR checkups with dentist to monitor progress

Due to the pandemic, zoomers have became extremely self conscious about their teeth. Being on a zoom call every day and having to speak up, it's not surprising that a lot of people are wanting to their correct the posture of their teeth. SDC has been the best solution for a lot of these people who cannot afford the frequent dentist visits and also for those who are afraid of catching COVID (and definitely for those who are shy). Invisalign does not offer this mail-by-order service and are at a severe disadvantage in this ever growing digital world. 

If you take a lot at the below, their revenue Y/Y has been increasing as well as their EPS. There is the potential that their EPS actually goes positive for year end

2018: 327mm

2019: 750mm

2020: ???

$SDC is only valued at 5.7 bn

Their competitor? $ALGN (valued at 42.6 bn)

2017: 1.5 bn

2018: 1.9 bn

2019: 2.4 bn

So here it is. 

&#x200B;

CRSR - Corsair Gaming

&#x200B;

Net Revenue for Q3 was $457.1 million - 60.7% increase year-over-year.

&#x200B;

Gross Profit was 127.9 Million an increase of 112% year-over year with gross margin of 28%.

&#x200B;

This was BEFORE Christmas, Black Friday, and winter break. These are going to skyrocket even further. 

&#x200B;

For Q4 The Preliminary Financial Results are as follows:

&#x200B;

Net Revenue to be about 1.7 Billion

&#x200B;

Net income was around 101 Million 

&#x200B;

The Market Cap for this stock is \~3.31 B and their Revenue for Q4 is half of that? Insane. I'm likely expecting it to be way over the estimations above just like when they doubled expectations the quarter before. All kids have  had to do all lockdown/winter break is play on their PC's, Consoles, and your wive's boyfriends PC. The floor for this is 35$ as shown by the past month and a half and It peaked at 51$. I have a price target of at least 55$ and possible 60$+ Corsair also owns Elgato.

&#x200B;

These numbers aren't going to drop either after COVID. When you invest this much money into a gaming setup for you or your child or whatever. They will keep putting money in. When their mouse breaks from smashing it after losing an online game like the baby they are. Or perhaps after they spill their Mountain Dew all over their mousepad? A lot of things that this pandemic has made us accustomed to are here to stay. I bought a bunch of CRSR Equipment a few years back and I still love it and have gifted the mousepads. I have bought every single dip the past month and I'm waiting for my big payday to mars   🚀     🚀     🚀  

&#x200B;

This is also just good long term if you don't want to play the options game (IV is really high right now premiums a bit much for my taste. 

&#x200B;

I listened into their last earnings call and they really know the esports industry and what to do with it. 

&#x200B;

They are expected to blowout earnings again. I sure as hell am not going to miss out on this like I missed on GME and partly BB.

&#x200B;

Obviously none of this is investment advice and please do your own DD. I'm just a brainlet with the robinhood app who gets high off gaming and gambling. 

&#x200B;

Positions: 305 Shares - I had 40$ Calls in December but took profits on them no longer holding.

This means we are **reopening** soon with **stimulus** being passed since Mitch folded. This will cause a lot of inflation. Enough so that it will prompt banks to demand higher interest rates as their loans are getting clapped due to weakening dollar. FED could raise rates sooner than expected and taper off bond purchases (slow down money printer) Hence market selling off because Growth stocks do poorly in high inflation environments. Value and dividend stocks do well in inflation. This means I like ***LOWE's***! BUYBACKS + STIMULUS + DIVIDEND + GREEN TAX CREDITS. Read this, [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/052913/inflations-impact-stock-returns.asp#:\~:text=Value%20stocks%20perform%20better%20in,volatile%20during%20highly%20inflationary%20periods](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/052913/inflations-impact-stock-returns.asp#:~:text=Value%20stocks%20perform%20better%20in,volatile%20during%20highly%20inflationary%20periods).

This is all contingent on it all working according to plan though. The recent short squeezes scared the boomers out of the market today during the big drop, but Lowe's outperformed.

I do not consider myself a real investor because I am new to this, Sorry for anyone I offended.*

*But for those claiming I am just here as a BB bear, my last post (which was a pitch I got from the same friend) was a bullish call post that helped whoever listened make >100% on their calls.* [*https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ixqk3z/crnc\_buy\_dip\_after\_idiotic\_short\_seller\_report/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ixqk3z/crnc_buy_dip_after_idiotic_short_seller_report/) 

*Edit: I dont know the mods took this down the first time I posted it. I think it was due to some language that I have tried to remove in edit.*

I think this is going to get a bunch of downvotes because it's not bullish. But someone else recently posted on here that they werent seeing two-sided conversations anymore and it seemed as though there were at least some people who upvoted him. I have enjoyed the actual DD posts I've found on here and thought that this was a good read so I thought I would pass along.

I emailed one of my best friends who runs software for his HF and asked what he thought about BB / whether I should hold onto my shares. I edited / redacted some lines to help protect his identity, and bolded a few for emphasis. His fund was up almost 100% last year and as you'll see in his comments, they were / are long a number of other WSB stocks, which I thought definitely added some credibility.

Anyways, take it for whatever it's worth, but thought I'd pass along. I am going to sell my BB shares at open and buy more GME + the other names he recommended to me, which I'm going to start doing some reading on.

\-----------

Hey man, you should take whatever I say with a grain of salt as nothing I say should be considered investment advice. But to give you a sense, **our biggest winners last year as a fund were TSLA, CRWD, and two companies who sell vertical software into the auto ecosystem (so I'd say we know both the security and auto tech space very well). We also currently own GME shares, which I think this still have room to run.**

**But from my vantage point, the BB move does not reflect fundamentals and the fair value of that stock is materially lower, ie. somewhere in the $7 range, and most likely lower.**

Yes, BB is a cyber security company now, not a mobile phone company. But that's nothing new. You can think of the company as having 3 parts: (1) non auto security (endpoint management + endpoint security), (2) QNX (autos), and (3) IP licensing.

**(1) Non-auto security:** UEM (unified endpoint management) and endpoint security (Cylance, what competes with CRWD). These businesses are getting absolutely smoked. This year was the first year that BB did not appear in the top right Gartner quartile, and MSFT has been eating their lunch bc their offering (InTune) is basically free. Churn in this segment is probably \~20% / year, and has been declining in revenue for multiple years now. Meanwhile, endpoint (Cyclance) has been a disaster. This last year, while the big endpoint companies (Crowdstrike, Carbon Black, Sentinel One) grew close to 100%, Cylance was flat / slightly down y/y (during the biggest endpoint boom in history). Everyone from that team left post acquisition ([https://www.crn.com/news/security/cylance-founder-ceo-stuart-mcclure-exits-months-after-blackberry-deal?itc=refresh](https://www.crn.com/news/security/cylance-founder-ceo-stuart-mcclure-exits-months-after-blackberry-deal?itc=refresh)) and they are falling way behind competitors. This blended segment is going to continue to fall in revenue y/y.

**(2) QNX:** this is probably the best situated segment on a relative basis, but still struggling. The hype around the AWS announcement is way overblown. QNX is not going to be on 100% of cars because of this. MSFT and GOOG both have auto OEM offerings that do the same thing. There is no way AWS is going to get 100% market share, because no one ever gets 100% market share in anything. And in particular, auto OEMs are never going to want a single supplier to have 100% market share, their entire supply chain is built around ensuring that doesnt happen. The only reason AWS partnered with them is because they needed someone who already sold to auto OEM's to get their foot in the door. GOOG already has auto relationships from Android Automotive, while MSFT has a number of auto partners already signed on to their platform ([https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-connected-vehicle-platform-trends-and-investment-areas/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-connected-vehicle-platform-trends-and-investment-areas/)). So this lets AMZN cross-sell with someone and gives BB a reason to choose them. Right now BB has about 30% market share of cars that on the road. Even if that doubles in 6 years, you'd only be up to $8-$10 in value, because as they add ADAS customers, they are losing all their infotainment customers that make up current base. Also, AMZN is not going to ""share"" any of the recurring revenue with BB. BB has said they ""hope"" to cross sell their own new services as part of IVY, and when we talk to auto customers about this they laugh at the idea that they'd rather buy those services from BB over AMZN. Finally, QNX will not ""be needed on every single EV"" as some people claim. I think the bigger market there is rather than have the security built into a proprietary OS like QNX, you'll see cars start to include endpoint agents themselves (ie. from Crowdstrike or Sentinel One). CRWD is piloting this program today with a few OEMs.

**(3) IP Licensing:** this is effectively their mobile division that has transitioned from being in house to sold to 3P's. Mgmt has said this is going to be flat on a forward basis and will start declining in a few years (avg patent life of 10 yrs, no new R&D). If you assume this is currently a 90% gross margin business, then IP currently makes up 100% of the firms profits (software is not yet profitable).

Two final notes - BB's business does not generate ""recurring"" revenue. This is pretty easy to tell bc every quarter, the ""recurring"" ARR goes down, and quarterly revenue is not = at least 25% of the disclosed recurring revenue amount. Also, this is no longer a company at the cutting edge of technology, despite what people are saying. Again, easy way to tell this is that R&D has been falling every quarter since they made the Cylance acquisition two years ago. How many co's do you know that are investing for the cloud / new products that are spending less on R&D every quarter?

**So at the end of the day, you have a software business that has declining revenue and is not yet profitable, an auto product that is losing share on its legacy infotainment business, and an IP business that is going to fall off a cliff in a couple of years. Aggregate revenue is going to be rising low single digits and EBITDA growth after next year will be flat.**

In terms of valuation, dont forget to dilute the share count by 60mm shares for the convert they just issued last quarter. **If you give the company a generous 20x fwd EBITDA on out year bullish numbers the upside case is $10/sh, while the base case is more like $5-7.**

**If you really believed the upside case, then I could see rationale for buying at $6 to play for the $10 of upside.** That's fair. But The idea that this is a $100bn or even $20bn mkt cap is ludicrous. We arent short the name, but I would strongly advise you not to put a significant portion of your money in the stock. It very well may go up bc there's no telling how high stocks on these momentum moves can go, but at some point you have to be the one holding the stock and I dont want it to be you. Stock's can only maintain their value in the multi-billion valuation range at the end of these runs if there is institutional demand to buy the next share (which is what happened in TSLA), and I dont think that exists for BB north of $10.

**I think there are much better things to put your money into.** We still own **GME** (which I know is a a favorite among your friends), which I think has a much better setup. If you want security software exposure, I would tell you we're bullish on **PANW, CRWD, and ZS**. If you want auto tech exposure, I'd say you should look at **LPRO**, which recently SPAC'd and isn't yet followed / understood by the street. A couple other random longs I like right now are **BABA** and **PENN**.

Feel free to lmk if you have any follow up questions. Glad to see you're focused on the fundamentals."|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224333.csv|StockTicker

First off props to: [https://twitter.com/Ksidiii](https://twitter.com/Ksidiii)  a professional vol trader on wall street, unlike us retards, he knows what he is doing, anyway he tweeted about this a little while ago and it caught my eye, with all of the convexity squeezes going on right now this could be a contender. 

To keep this short and sweet: XOP, the boing boomer ETF similar to GME has a pretty large short interest: 

[XOP Short Interest](https://preview.redd.it/tb3qmego8rd61.png?width=1718&format=png&auto=webp&s=e65af4cc3bab4a324d25218db716eec026895c7b)

There also seems to be a large long OI of calls around the max strike (see skew diagram,) which as we have seen seems to allow for a magnet effect as dealers are forced to buy shares as spot approaches the strike price, this is good for us as the some of the work is (potentially) already done (As soon as I get my hands on some transaction data (hopefully soon) I will try and find the aggressor in these max strike OI.) 

[XOP OI](https://preview.redd.it/diqvmoaq8rd61.png?width=1498&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f462ff16eb946cd16192412c79c22924b5ac8e5)

One positive about this boomer ETF, is unlike GME or BBBY, if this squeeze never happens, it is objectively not a dying (or already dead) industry which means it is not a terrible hold. There has also been talks about the rotation from growth to value, which I haven't looked into a lot but thought its worth mentioning.

There are concrete reasons NOT to invest into GameStop. I'll make a list cause I can bearly write cl3arly and lack the necessary skills to write for good reading comprehension.

1. GameStop is selling games at a brick and mortar store. You have to ride your bike to the store cause your wife's boyfriend is borrowing your newly bought Tesla from your GME tendies. A real retard will buy it online and have it delivered or just download it.
2. GameStop screws the customer on trade in value.
3. Funko Pop! Shit pieces of plastic to make you think you are fulfilling your life by adding crap to it.
4. PC Master Race!
5. Negative Earnings. They don't make enough money to justify current price. How do you expect them to make future earnings when they are closing stores.
6. Gaming journalism is at a low and hasn't recovered since GamerGate happened. (Gamestop owns Game Informer magazine)

Now a list of why you SHOULD invest into GameStop

1. To make other people richer. Seriously, be careful with this, we are not manipulating the price, the big boys are. Those of you that bought at the high of 159.18, I will hope that you will see that price again. Those of you that sold at the high of 159.18, Nice!
2. WallStreetBets DD, discussion and Redditors that are way smarter then me and still believe this stock will moon.
3. Stonks only go up."|2021-01-26 22:43:03.870587|../output/raw/2021/01/26/StockTicker_224333.csv|StockTicker
