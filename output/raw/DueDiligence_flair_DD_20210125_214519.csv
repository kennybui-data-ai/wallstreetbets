# The new BlackBerry

When suddenly the BlackBerry and Amazon partnership was announced on December 1st, 2020, most people were shocked (other than those who have been following the story), to learn that BlackBerry “the Phone Company” was still around. Soon they all realized that the phone company from back in the day has now transformed itself into a Software Security Company using AI and Machine Learning.

Once a pioneer in smartphone technology, is now pioneering the technology of the future. AI, ML, EV, AV, 5G, WFH, UEM, UES, EPP, MTD, EDR, UEBA, Zero Trust, Zero Touch, Crisis Communications, Cloud and more.

Remember even though BlackBerry has transformed from a hardware company to a software company the technology it developed is still in use today on mobile phones. BlackBerry owns a ton of patents due to being a pioneer in the smartphone business. Some of us don’t realize this but the work email you get on your iPhone, Android Phone, laptop or desktop (Mac or Windows) is secured by BlackBerry.

# 2021 Catalysts for Blackberry

One catalyst is that a deal was made with BlackBerry and Amazon's Web Services which will develop and market BlackBerry’s intelligent-vehicle-data platform – called Ivy – to help automakers create in-vehicle services.

The first BlackBerry device, the 850, was introduced in 1999 as a two-way pager in Munich. 

Blackberry also has partnership deals with Zoom, OnwardMobility and Huawei.

* Blackberry and Amazon: On Dec. 1, Blackberry announced it had partnered with Amazon Web Services to develop and bring to market BlackBerry’s Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. Automakers [will be able to use the software for the smart and autonomous electric vehicles](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/12/aws-and-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform) being developed.
* Blackberry and Zoom: On Oct. 16, Blackberry announced it was partnering with Zoom. Zoom will be using Blackberry’s [Blackberry Dynamics cybersecurity software](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-and-zoom-together-secure-your-virtual-enterprise-meetings) in its mobile platform to protect companies from cyberattacks and data breaches. Blackberry Dynamics software also provides secure video conferencing, which Blackberry says will become more necessary as companies move away from in-person meetings.  
* Blackberry and Huawei: Earlier this month,[ it was reported ](https://www.androidheadlines.com/2021/01/blackberry-key-smartphone-patents-huawei.html)that Blackberry had sold 90 patents to Chinese telecommunications company Huawei. Blackberry holds more patents than any other company in Canada, many that are applicable to smartphones that Blackberry no longer will concentrate on. 
* Blackberry and OnwardMobility: Despite Blackberry moving away from smartphones, last August Blackberry announced it would be partnering with OnwardMobility to help the tech startup produce Blackberry-branded smartphones with 5G technology. The phones are set to be released in[ the first half of this year](https://www.onwardmobility.com/about/).

# Blackberry,  SpaceX, and Blade Urban Air Mobility (ARK Investments)

SpaceX is using Blackberry QNX technology. It’s also expected that Blade Urban Air Mobility (EXPC) is also using Blackberry QNX technology in their flying machines. I expect by the year 2025 there will be over 75 billion devices with QNX worldwide.

One should also note that Cathie Wood's Ark Invest started a position in Blade Urban Air Mobility's SPAC called Experience Investment (EXPC).

\**Can't post pic because retard bot will delete it, go check ARKQ yourself*.

# My reason to believe Blackberry goes back to $65 or even $100+

Space sector is getting hot every day, Elon Musk is looking to take Starlink public, I see Blackberry playing a role in this since SpaceX already uses Blackberry's QNC technology. The same thing can be said about Blade Urban Air Mobility.

Blackberry QNC will become Space's real time operating system, this is just the beginning just like how Blackberry engineered Mobile devices, they will be the leader (the glue) in IoT and real time analytics.

TLDR: BUY, moon soon!

1,l4ehan,BlackBerry DD,t3_l4ehan,0.98,4721,4721,top,2021-01-25 06:04:32.000000,_MoveSwiftly,918,DD,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4ehan/blackberry_dd/,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4ehan/blackberry_dd/,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4ehan/blackberry_dd/,"**Note**: BlackBerry is NOT a cyber security company. They are a *security company*. Revenue does not care about your AI driven autonomous machine learning EV car with DDs. People are using these terms loosely. A quick lookup for interviews with John Chen would prove that he explicitly avoids these terms as they do not define nor matter to the products/revenue of BlackBerry. QNX revenue does not depend on any of these terms, it's on installation on any device. This includes the space station, of which there is 1 of with obviously non-recurring revenue. Buying based on these basis would be gambling.

**Bull**:

* Business transformation: BlackBerry is now a software company, starting the transformation in 2015. The focus is security, the general term.
* 5 Products:
   * QNX: Embedded system OS.
      * Multi-OS housing: It has the capability to allow for multiple OSs on a single chip.
      * Real-time availability/software prioritization: Not all pieces of software operate on the same priority. Steering/braking would be higher priority than media, and QNX allows for that. Even if the thread/core is shared with other applications, when high priority software is requesting a resource it will be prioritized to ensure reliability.
      * Resource sharing: CPU, RAM, and GPU resource sharing between different applications capability. Two applications can share the same CPU core and bump each other based on prioritization.
      * Why not Linux? QNX has the highest certification for security available. Linux does not. CEOs would want to avoid liability and this certification allows for that.
      * Device agnostic: It can be installed on any device, not just cars. Any IoT and offline device can use QNX.
   * QNX Hypervisor: Consolidate multiple OSs on a single SoC using virtualization
      * SoC: System on a chip. Instead of using multiple ECUs, which is what car manufacturers currently do, they can use one single chip to run multiple high priority applications and multiple OSs. This is what Tesla does now.
      * Virtualization: Running an OS in a virtual environment. Think Linux environment inside of Windows. This helps with debugging for developers without having to have the actual hardware.
   * IVY: Scalable cloud-connected software platform for vehicles.
      * What is it a solution for? When a vehicle manufacturer wants a way to transmit the QNX/OS data safely, normalize it, and visualize it/interact with it. It also allows car manufacturers to own the data, unlike other OSs.
      * Scalable: AWS servers are capable of handling the load from many endpoints.
      * Software platform: There is currently no centralized software ecosystem for vehicles. IVY is providing that.
      * Non-BB developers would be able to use an SDK to develop applications on IVY for infotainment/general apps/others. IVY will also use ML to gain insight on unrecognized patterns by developers. An example of this is detecting if a car slipped, without having the developer connect multiple sensors to figure out if that event happened.
      * 50/50 joint effort on revenue and effort to develop the ecosystem. Using AWS's knowledge in AI/ML for calculated sensors (slip, driver on seat, etc)
      * Usage by other vendors: A city can connect to the data from vehicles and detect when ice/slipping is happening. If brakes are getting overheated coming from a high elevation area. If a car had an accident, etc. An insurance company can provide an app to give discounts similar to the currently implemented OBD-2 readers. A maintenance provider can also connect to this data and check if an error is specific to maintenance, malpractice, or general misuse.
   * Spark: Endpoint management. Basically API security. Did not delve far into this, basic info.
      * Unified Endpoint Security: This is the endpoint where a laptop/phone/IoT device hits. It provides encryption and security around that. Continuous authentication is a part of it, where a device is learning the user behavior using ML and continuously checking if the behavior matches the original owner; if not, lock the device.
      * Unified Endpoint Management: Basically managing your API for devices.
      * Zero trust: I think this is specifically talking about continuous authentication. Basically, it's not an authenticate once and forget it. It's constantly tracking behavior to verify the user is the authenticated user.
   * AtHoc: Non-enterprise communication system.
      * Target customers: Government, healthcare, education, etc.
      * Solution: A communication system targeting non-enterprise businesses; specifically for Event management, cross organizational communication/collaboration, mass notifications.
      * Who does this benefit? You've seen the hacks in healthcare/educational/governmental sector. This is specifically for them.
   * SecuSUITE: Phone application to allow employees to use work related data in personal devices without cross communication (between personal and work data).
      * End to end encryption.
      * Separation of concerns between personal and work data. Employers CANNOT access your personal data.
      * Used by NATO; doesn't carry much value in my book but maybe in yours.
* Customer oriented solutions: As you've seen in the products above, some products overlap and are just names to target specific customers. It allows customers to easily understand what product could solve their issue. Continuous authentication is a great example of this: Their customer complained that they kept re-authenticating, so they designed a solution allowing them to authenticate once and using ML they learned their behavior and can continuously check if the user is the owner/authenticated user. This kind of passion in leadership is good for business.
* Liability: QNX has the highest security rating available. Most CEOs want to avoid liability when it comes to security, using QNX would help them avoid that in a similar way cloud services help them avoid being blamed for hacking.
* Leadership: BBs leadership isn't one to play on famous words to drive the stock up. John Chen explicitly states this in his interviews and says they are a security company. Not cyber, doesn't mention AI or whatever. He explicitly avoids meme words and understands what the point of BBs business is.

Where I think growth can be made:

1. QNX in more cars. They can capitalize on the idea of less ECUs = less cost for OEMs + security.
2. IVY usage by OEMs along with QNX.
3. IVY ecosystem. Maybe application billing?
4. Professional services (support) for the products listed.
5. AtHoc increased market share in more governmental/healthcare/educational entities.
6. SecuSUITE for more enterprise customers with the idea being saving employers money from purchasing work phones for employees, and worrying about securing them.

**Bear**:

* Revenue: It is not yet based on a subscription/usage basis. You can only produce so many cars, and they don't give an insight on how much do they charge per car for QNX. Anywhere from $2 - $20 is what was mentioned in transcripts. This is a growth area, but not at a trajectory that's excellent. IVY does work on a subscription/usage basis, but IVY can be used WITHOUT QNX. I'm worried about this, but still see it as an area that will generate revenue in the range of $400 MM - $600 MM at the price of $20 per 30M cars. The 30M per year is based on the listing of their customers and their yearly production rates. Keep in mind I stated any device, this does not include trucks or other IoT devices.
* Market share: These are relatively new products. J.P. Morgan pointed this out as a priority for growth. This could end up not working out and growth never happens. This is a relatively low risk due to QNX and IVY providing SO MUCH value for car manufacturers Vs. other products in the market.
* Patent revenue: They sold a chunk of their no longer relevant patents to Huawei. This makes up a small (<= 32%) of their revenue and is a one time sale. The coming quarter could be equal or less to the last quarter revenue due to either other sales making up the lost revenue from patents, or coming up short. It could come higher if they sold more services, but due to COVID and knowing that many car manufacturers have lowered their production due to chip shortage, the next quarter will most likely be lower.
* VW.os: VW is making their own OS. VW.os is what they're calling it. They're currently using QNX, but that revenue could potentially stop. Personally I don't believe VW is capable of doing that. It's a marketing hype. Their companies are not capable of good collaboration or good implementation based on what I've read and researched (can't find article right now), but it's something to be concerned about.
* QNX success: While IVY could be using QNX, it does NOT depend on it. There is potential for OEMs to use IVY without QNX. I think this is a low risk, but still risk. 19 OEMs are already using QNX.
* Lack of Answers: I can't get much out of their earnings call. They don't delve into pricing for QNX, how they plan to grow it besides getting more car manufacturers and more cars post Corona. How they plan to do recurring revenue. A breakdown of each revenue segment would be helpful, but I don't see that either and there is hesitancy to delve into it.

**Prediction**: I think QNX can become a $1B revenue per year alone. $2B revenue per year as a company is not far fetched. Without a subscription/usage based model, it is difficult to see how growth can go beyond that. BB is good in 2-5 years, not this year. I can see their revenue growing to potentially $2B - $4B revenue per year. They did mention trying to figure out a subscription/usage based billing, if done then the revenue would be much higher. I think $18 is a fair price on the high end. It could grow further than that, but expectations would be HIGH.

Sup retards.

&#x200B;

I have seen a fuckload of people comparing the VW squeeze to the GME squeeze and heres why that is an absolutely retarded thing to do:

&#x200B;

**1) Time and Tech**

* I don't think this REALLY needs to be said, but the VW squeeze happened in 2008. GME squeeze is happening in 2021. There are some key differences here:
   * Quicker trades:  Back in 2008, online brokerages were really just beginning, with a low number of users. That means that things went quite a bit slower than they do now. Instead of months, this squeeze will take weeks.

**2) Players**

* **Retail was not significantly involved in the VW squeeze.** We are seeing massive swings in price because retail is involved, buying, and more importantly **selling** significantly. Also, retail trading of GME calls is leading to increased volatility that just wasn't there in the VW squeeze. **Therefore, comparing the chart of the VW squeeze to the GME chart is just retarded.**

**3) Ratio of shares sold short to available shares**

* **The GME squeeze CANNOT and WILL NOT be bigger than the VW squeeze for one reason: MATH.** In the VW squeeze, the ratio of Available shares to Short shares was 1:12. This means that for every share that was available to cover with, 12 were sold short. **This IS NOT, and NEVER HAS been the case with gamestop. At its peak, gamestop had a ratio of 1:2.56 of available float, and roughly 1:1.07 total float.**
   * Knowing this, mathematically the GME squeeze WILL NOT BE GREATER than the VW one. ~~we will likely see it top off at around 3-500 Maximum.~~
      * Yes, I know that the VW squeeze could've gone higher if it hadn't been for people helping them out of their short positions, but they were in an entirely different situation with a ratio of 1:12 than any of the shorts are with a ratio of 1:2.56 (maximum)

I could go more in depth with this, but I'm not going to. hopefully you guys can understand it.

**TL:DR: GME squeeze IS NOT the VW squeeze and they really** ***CANNOT BE COMPARED ON ANY INTELLECTUALLY HONEST MERIT.***

Comparing the two charts ""guys we are just in the dip, HOLD!!!11!"" is **PURELY CONFIRMATION BIAS and should be taken with a grain of salt.**

&#x200B;

edit: there has been a lot of great discussion in this thread and there is something i'd like to address:

This situation is completely new: we have so many other variables that have never been seen in the market driving this crazy rocket ship, and there is no way to accurately predict a top, bottom, etc on this. Because of this, I have edited out my ""estimation"" of a top, because I think that there is really no way for me to accurately find that number for you guys, and dont want to be misleading. 

Though I tried to use previous short squeezes in history to predict the top by adjusting variables, there is really no way for me to accurately do this, I realize it all comes down to estimation and speculation, and it would be dishonest for me to assert a top without knowing any of this for sure. 

That being said, still dont compare these two squeezes (especially the chart for fucks sake) , and GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",2021-01-25 21:45:19.915256,../output/raw/DueDiligence_flair_DD_20210125_214519.csv

Nokia recently renewed their 5-year contract with T-Mobile

## T-Mobile awards Nokia with five-year deal

T-Mobile awarded five-year deals to both Ericsson and Nokia for the continued rollout of its 5G network, but didn’t specify how much the deals are worth other than to say they’re “multi-billion-dollar” agreements.

T-Mobile last year closed its merger with Sprint, which also used Samsung network gear, but it doesn’t appear that work is carrying over to the newly combined T-Mobile.

“T-Mobile already has the largest 5G network in the country,” said T-Mobile President of Technology Neville Ray in a statement. “These agreements with our longstanding 5G partners Nokia and Ericsson will help us take our 5G leadership even further, delivering ever-better experiences for our customers for years to come.”

[According to Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/14/nokia-supports-t-mobile-5g-evolution-with-five-year-expansion-deal/), it will continue to expand T-Mobile’s Extended Range (low-band) 5G coverage while also supplying macro and small cells across T-Mobile’s low, mid-band and millimeter wave spectrum, in addition to Massive MIMO in the 2.5 GHz band.

Nokia said the outlook it provided last fall included the expected impact of this deal with T-Mobile, so it doesn’t change that guidance.

Nokia in particular can use some good news in the network supply arena. Last fall, Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark warned of expected financial challenges in 2021 and indicated plans to invest heavily in 5G. It’s been widely speculated that Nokia lost a $6.6 billion 5G contract with Verizon last year when the U.S. carrier instead [chose Samsung](https://www.fiercewireless.com/financial/samsung-scores-6b-network-deal-verizon).

They even have more deals and contracts here: [https://www.nokia.com/networks/5g/5g-contracts/](https://www.nokia.com/networks/5g/5g-contracts/)

# Why I think this stock has the potential to run

In 2020 NASA awarded Nokia (NOK) first mobile cellular network on the moon. Stocks pertaining to the Space economy are a new emerging sector right now. You're seeing all these Space ETFS coming into the market. This new emerging space economy is worth around $2 trillion. Now, you probably know what I'm going to say next in case you don't let me tell you!

The new CEO has been recently aiming focus on 5G, 5G will be needed to aid self driving cars etc. But one thing that's bigger than that is being able to connect to the internet any where in the world, perhaps via satellite in space. As a company, this could open a variety of new opportunities for NOK in this emerging $2 trillion space economy.

This one got buried and is worth reading. 

# What’s happened thus far

### Why did GME go up on Friday? 

The story here is more complex than paid media articles would like you to believe. GME has been driven up by 3 different forces: 

* Organic buying
   * There is a mixture of growing positive sentiment in the investor world (not just WSB) about GME’s future
   * There’s been a lot of good due diligence shared not just on WSB but even outside (for example, see gmedd.com)
   * The Citron Backfire
      * Shorts were on the ropes and kept looking for hail mary’s. They went to Citron and [coordinated a dump](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) to try to bring the price down.
      * However, this backfired. Citron is so disliked in the industry that new wealth poured into GME in the face of Andrew Left’s pleas. Even when Benzinga brought Andrew Left on air, **minutes after he left** [they bought shares live on their show](https://youtu.be/mFiFWBrE5DE?t=5104)**.** 
      * The next day, our very on u/Uberkikz11 [was on Benzinga](https://youtu.be/GLzTU87MJMM?t=837) and more shares were bought. 
   * Larger investors piling in
      * In my [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/), I hypothesized that we’d soon see larger investors pile in. Then, on WSB, we saw posts from a [venture capitalist](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/) as well as a [hedge fund investor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/)
* Gamma squeeze
   * Once the organic buying started, we rolled into a gamma squeeze. Many people written about the gamma squeeze so I won’t repeat, see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/) for an example. 
* Ultra low liquidity - In EndGame part 1, I talked about how the actual actively traded shares are much lower than the reported float, and **share availability has been reducing** driven by lots of diamond hands, not just among smaller guys like us but the larger folks too. 
* I believe there were some short covers on Friday, but Ortex was still estimating 71M shares short at the eod. 

However, not many people have talked about why it **went down**

### Why did GME come down? 

Here’s where things got interesting for me, and something I think happened again today (Monday) when GME climbed up over 100% but then had a rapid reversal, closing 20% above yesterday but closing below open. 

So Friday looked like a slam dunk - gamma squeeze, no shorts available to short, puts were getting exceedingly expensive as a short tactic. What happened?

This is my fan fiction, based on what I saw.

**I believe** [**market-makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) **took a non-neutral stance and began actively shorting the stock after the second halt.** 

Market-makers are responsible for maintaining liquidity and functioning in the stock market, but they also have abilities that others don’t - for example they are legally allowed to naked short for “liquidity purposes”. They also have the ability to halt trading. 

There were two halts in the day on Friday: First, when GME was up 69% (heh heh), and then a few minutes later when it kept climbing after the first halt was relaxed. Note that at the time of the first halt, the **bid-ask spread was $10 on the underlying** a huge signal that there just were not enough shares to buy.

However, after the second halt, something strange happened. Whereas a few minutes prior, there were no sellers willing to sell their shares below $75, **within 15 minutes** after the halt there were sellers at 70, 65, 60, and 56. Where did these sellers come from? 

&#x200B;

[Incredible momentum reversal on Friday 1\/22 to push the price not too far above the 60c strike price. ](https://preview.redd.it/tt5zodp6pkd61.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa22980543213227bf5b3d17166129ac6cb65a65)

My speculation? This was a coordinated **naked short ladder attack**. In this type of attack, short seller A sells to short seller B, who then turns around to short seller A at a lower price, etc. and with a **very small amount of capital** you can wreck the momentum of a stock and make people think that others are running for the exits.

Notice how the stock dropped from a high of $75 on Friday to below 60 - the highest expiring SP for the 1/22 options, and stayed tight in range for the rest of the day. Now, for compliance reasons, MM are required to be neutral by EOD, so 20 minutes before close, MMs had to buy back all their short positions, which led to the strong close above 60.

All this led me to believe that the **real fair market price for GME was above $65.** Without the market makers interference, GME would have closed higher. 

### A repeat on Monday

The short ladder attack repeated on Monday. 

GME opened strong above $90, and quickly climbed to **a high above $155** before it was halted, immediately after the halt, a **short ladder attack again** drove the price down 

&#x200B;

[Dejavu - Incredible Momentum Reversal after trading halts. ](https://preview.redd.it/qm81rd0dpkd61.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b4563e7dd2e626fb09dca69668c24631932e707)

Both days, there **were rapid and significant reversals in momentum.** 

Now, I kept wondering - why would MM’s take the side of the shorts? What’s in it for them? One theory was that they were not adequately hedged, with the low liquidity of the stock meaning that the price was moving up too fast for them to acquire the shares they needed to. 

But then the news hit today: 

# A new opponent enters the ring:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8htb0scgpkd61.png?width=926&format=png&auto=webp&s=228a8a84e592ea4642a61c5e07e07ae344ac8f2c

That’s right, the **same Citadel** [**listed by the NYSE as one of their designated market makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) is now invested in Melvin’s hedge fund and has a financial interest in the direction of GME’s share price. 

**Hey media - you want a manipulation story? You’re missing the big one.** 

# Now what? 

Shorts have pulled new dirty tactics each time they’ve been pushed to the edge. Paid media attacks, Citron’s fluff tweet + coordinated shorting, and now they’ve got the **actual people who get all the order flow on their side.** 

On the other hand, GME is still up over 20% and now trading at $88.00 after hours, which is well above the previous day’s high. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rr5qet4ipkd61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=96d28bf446a714906712503726f5903a681d5368

What this tells me is that GME’s **true price is still being suppressed**. They are using every tactic possible, even changing the [bid-ask spread rules](https://thefly.com/permalinks/entry.php/id3233043/GME;IRBT-NYSE-changes-bidask-differentials-on-options-for-GameStop-iRobot) on options to specifically target retail’s buying of options. 

We’re now playing the game against the folks who write the rules of the game. 

Some shorts may have covered today - with prices below $60 at one point they had some great opportunities to. However, there is **no way all of the shorts who need to exit covered today.** 

The short position still lost 20% from yesterday. They’ve got more fingers in the dam, but it’s definitely cracking. Also, **every call option purchased prior to 1/25 is ITM and profitable,** while **every put option purchased prior to 1/25 is OTM.**

And, for some reason, the SEC still doesn’t want to enforce the threshold securities list for GME, where it’s now **been on for more than 30 days in a highly covered “short squeeze”.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rbrf6khjpkd61.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e4f432ff02dbf475a03cc68c54a5a0f5f0de429

# Margin impacts:

Note that at this point, most brokers have increased margin on GME. This means that people that are long or short on margin will need to put up capital to hold their positions. 

This also means **puts will get more expensive** as people who sell puts will have to maintain 100% of the notional in their accounts to secure the put, so MMs will have fewer retail sellers of puts to absorb the demand. 

That means it’s not a bad idea to sell puts to acquire shares if you’re aiming for the long-term and not the squeeze, but keep in mind you’ll need the exact same capital as if you’d bought the shares, so it’s up to you on this. 

For shorts, a margin increase while the price is moving against you (even with retracements) is no good. 

# My speculation

* Cohen and the GME board have been strangely silent this entire run. It’s possible they can’t say anything at all during the pre-earnings quiet period, but I’m sure they can see what’s happening. 
* MMs will continue to play dirty, but at the same time they will need to continue to need to buy GME shares to delta hedge 1/29 and later ITM options as we get closer to expiry. 

# Things to be careful about

As you can see, this is no easy win. I've been in GME for a few months but I've seen almost every trick in the book. In addition to the [suggestions I wrote about in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/), here’s some things to be careful about. 

* **Be careful about swapping ITM calls for OTM calls:** it can be tempting to trade-up your options for higher return, but be mindful of the delta impact. You may actually be driving the sale of shares by MMs when you don’t mean to. For example, if you sell a .5 delta call for 2 .2 delta calls, that’s net reduction of 10 shares that MMs have to hold long as leverage. 
* **Be careful about being short any calls this week:** Not only do you limit your upside (which is dumb in the prospect of a squeeze), you could end up in a nightmare scenario. A call that ends OTM on Friday could end up ITM after hours if you didn’t sell it, and you may get assigned while the underlying continues to go up. 
* **There are a few other dirty tactics shorts can play.** I’m not specifically going to share them here because I don’t want to give the ideas circulation, but 
   * **Choose your own limit sells based on personal sell points.** Don’t copy others and don’t try to be memey. Make your own decisions. 
   * **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it’s an **attack vector** for you. 
* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn’t resume for the rest of the day? **All your 1/29 calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you’re taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration. 
* **Be careful about buying on margin.** Brokers are rapidly increasing margins. If you bought on margin with 2:1 leverage, and the stock went up 100%, you’d be in margin call even without a margin change. If the broker moves margin against you, you’ll get to margin call faster. 
* **Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose.** I’ve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing (remember last Monday with the short sale restriction?), you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I’ve held through multiple 30-40% drawdowns in the underlying; and **held through a 50% drawdown today**, so you need to be ready for the volatility. 
* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It’s common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you’ve set a stop loss, be really sure about it.

This is why Nokia will boom in 2021. Like $BB, it is no longer a phone company, but is now a major contender in 5G, autonomous driving, AI tech and cyber security. In fact, it almost sounds like a better blackberry with more upside potential. $NOK is trading at $4.75 at the time of writing. It saw a steady decline since it's previous high of $5 in August of 2020, but has since recovered in the last 4 months. 

The reason for the initial selloff was a corporate decision to cut jobs to free up cashflow for large projects going forward. At this time they also halted dividends which pissed off some older retirees, as expected. Now here is the various reason this stock can deliver massive returns in the next 12-36 months.

**Selected for U.S. Federal 5G Security Project**

The project is to ensure a secure transition from 4G to 5G because of the various risks perceived by the general public, to whom security comes above all else. Nokia will provide both software and hardware solutions, and work with both NCCoE and Government to implement.

**Nokia wins Belgian 5G contracts as Huawei ousted**

To put it short, Nokia was chosen to implement 5G technology in Belgium as US continued to put pressure on literally everyone to end business with Huawei over potential security threats.

**5 Year Deal with T-Mobile**

T-Mobile will be using Nokia's Airscale Radio Platform to scale up 5G deployment. As well as this, Nokia will personally facilitate T-Mobiles upgrade from LTE to 5G, which is by all means a large project

**Partnership with Google Cloud**

Googles cloud computing services will be working together with Nokia to help businesses transform their network connectivity through the implementation of 5G and new cloud capabilities.

**Contract Secured with Tele2 in Sweden**

The amount has not been disclosed but it involves deploying 5G infrastructure for Tele2 subscribers in Sweden, to improve network performance and security. They will also use Nokia's NetAct Cloud Management system to improve management and security of sensitive subscriber data.

**Partnership with M1 to build Singapore 5G Ecosystem**

Together with M1, Nokia will implement their 5G standalone core to deliver advanced network capabilities to Singapore. The 5G Standalone core tech allows operators to design and automate network slices to further development of unmanned aerial or road vehicles, remote operations, wireless e-health, etc...

TL:DR

Nokia is not a phone Company. Major contender in the 5G space, cybersecurity AND AI autonomous vehicle operation. Partnerships with other large companies in both the US and abroad have set the stage for NOKIA to dominate 5G, which has the potential to see more growth than any other industry in 2021. Also have more upside potential as Huawei continues to lose contracts due to US pressure and potential security threats.

>Think of this stock as a under hyped and under valued IPO for Topgolf. Strong balance sheet, absolute market dominance, huge growth potential with virtually zero downside at today's price, buy buy buy.

[u/Andrewiscute](https://www.reddit.com/user/Andrewiscute) mentioned the following in response to Toptracer tech:

>I listened to the investor call. 80% ranges report revenues up 25% or more within 3 months of installation. At the call time there were 800 ranges on waitlists for installation and they are already in 30 countries. Top tracer is a very nice cherry on their business.

TLDR - no insider selling means more 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 fuel because paper handed insiders can’t give in to the shorts even if they wanted to.

Alright listen up. I did a quick search on WSB and didn’t see any hits actually talking about what is known as a “quiet period” or “blackout” for corporate stock trades in relation to insiders selling their company issues GME stock.

You NEED to know this to understand one of the big points that Citron made is complete BS in the short term (insiders creating liquidity for shorts).

I’m assuming that many WSBers have never received stock based compensation and may not know the general corporate governance rules around them that many (most/all?) companies impose on their insiders. Here’s a quick education in that and a summary of what it (might) mean for GME.

Obligatory disclaimer: I’m not a financial advisor and I am long GME.

First: what is stock based compensation?

This is exactly what it sounds like, when as part of your comp for being a good employee, you get some sort of stock with some sort of conditions attached. There are many different flavors of this that are important.

options - these give you the right to buy stock at some fixed price, known as a strike price, which may be significantly below than market value (good!). There are many different types of option (eg ISO, NQ), but at the end of the day most are a discount coupon for cheap below market stock values. These are common for preIPO companies. You’ll see these in the world of SPACs, for example, as warrants.

RSU: restricted stock units - these are literally shares, given almost like cash. More common for post IPO companies.

PRSU: performance RSUs - usually tied to some job performance goal, such as hitting a certain amount of revenue or other measurable goal.

Almost all stock based compensation comes with conditions, such as complying with whatever is in the associated company stock/equity plan. These are usually things like time vesting, which simply means that you can’t take stock and run but rather have to let it vest over a period of months/years.

From the wallst perspective, stock comp is reported as an expense, so you’ll see it in financial disclosures and investor presentations from time to time.

Second: how do companies ensure these incentives don’t hurt them or other shareholders?

This is critically important. Besides making sure there are clear policies on vesting and such, companies need to make sure that insiders do not use their company granted stock to hurt themselves or other shareholders, by performing trades during times when the employees may have critical information that the public does not. 

This is usually wrapped up in an insider trading policy.

Now, when WSB usually thinks about insider trading, you may think some hot head exec tipping off their golf buddy that the stock is about to crash (or pop) and they should act accordingly. Yes, that’s insider trading; however, there is a more mundane version which is insiders who might have a general idea if earnings are going to be good or bad and making trades of their own company stock to profit themselves.

To protect against that, companies will often place quiet periods / trading blackouts BEFORE THE END OF A QUARTER, often by weeks at a time, AND EXTEND THAT BLACKOUT THROUGH EARNINGS REPORT DAY.

READ: end of GME quarter is THIS MONTH, meaning it is incredibly likely that all GME issued stock owned by insiders is locked up under the corporate blackout.

This is almost certainly why you don’t see RC or anyone else from GME saying anything right now, due to quiet period.

In practical terms, GME would likely partner with a trading platform to administer stock grants, such as E*TRADE (which is common). The stock admin at GME would communicate blackout dates to E*TRADE (in this example), and During these dates, all of the sell functions in that stock plan account would be disabled.

READ: GME insiders see their stock plan values going through the roof right now, and CAN NOT SELL because of corporate blackout. This means the shorts can’t cover with insider liquidity like Citron said.

Since these blackouts usually extend thru earnings, and that is weeks/month away, those shares would be unavailable to bail out the shorts for paper handed insiders.

SUMMARY
Citron said short squeeze can’t happen when insiders are selling .... Insiders (very likely) can’t sell because of end of quarter blackout. 

This should be common knowledge for Citron and other shorts. Anyone else on here who has dealt with stock based comp, please do sanity check me here and I’m happy to edit and refine.

Edit: This is 🚀🚀🚀🚀 fuel , since this means yet more of the outstanding shares that are inaccessible to cover shorts.",2021-01-25 21:45:19.915256,../output/raw/DueDiligence_flair_DD_20210125_214519.csv

$GME has been a huge meme stock with the Gamma squeeze on Friday and the pending short squeeze upcoming this or next week. $BB is being overshadowed by $GME. 

When $GME inevitably falls back to earth after the squeeze, many newly minted millionaires will be looking for the next big thing. And that is $BB

$BB is very similar to $GME as it is a company that was huge in its time, currently is falling apart, but has a potentially bright future.
